Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200.    Broadway    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)     Off Broadway    'THE BLOWIN OF BAILE GALL' Ronan Noone's play concerns the complicated relationships among four laborers and a general contractor renovating a house in Ireland. Mr. Noone draws his characters sharply and surely, but the play is overburdened with conflict. There's enough here to fuel a whole season of a television soap (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444.(Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' In Rolin Jones's fanciful comedy, playfully directed by Jackson Gay, a lonely young woman in California embarks on an ambitious science project to help conquer her agoraphobia and trace her origins in China. Brisk, funny and engaging, the play disappoints only in its emphasis on flights of fancy over a nuanced depiction of its heroine's emotional dilemmas (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)  'KISSING FIDEL' In Eduardo Machado's overwrought new play, an emotionally incontinent novelist causes much havoc among a family of Cuban exiles in Miami when he announces that he's heading to the homeland to embrace the hated dictator. Much kissing, little coherence (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR' The Peccadillo Theater Company has revived this 1953 play by Dorothy Parker and Arnaud D'Usseau. A comedy set in an East Side hotel populated by widows and divorcees, it is an unyielding and coruscating portrait of women before feminism, relieved by Parker's dead-on wit. East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Honor Moore)    'MOTHER COURAGE' An effort more commendable for its intention than its execution. A staging that fails to capture either the tragedy or the comedy of the play, let alone the ironies of war (2:45). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Jennifer Mudge, as the girl he abandoned, is poignantly hopeless. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman) *'SPIRIT' Three men and one slippery slope of a stage. From these simple elements, the inspired London-based Improbable troupe maps a funny, melancholy and altogether entrancing journey into a land of dreams, warfare and actorly neurosis. A magical demonstration that theater can go places that no other art form can. (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalogue, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    * 'COUCHWORKS' On a set featuring a beat-up couch, this lively collection of one-acts by playwrights like Adam Rapp and Theresa Rebeck has the feel of a party thrown by the cool kids of downtown theater. By far the most fully realized play is ''Music for a High Ceiling,'' in which a potentially dry subject -- the history of the theremin and the trumpet -- is staged with panache and attention to detail by Steve Cosson, the artistic director of the excellent troupe the Civilians (1:30). The Tank at Chashama, 208 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman)    'LIMITLESS JOY' This muddled three-hour epic by Josh Fox, the experimental Brooklyn-based writer and director of dreamscapes like ''The Bomb,'' pulses with sex, violence and the kind of melodramatic music that would shame John Williams. Mr. Fox deserves credit for translating his bold and operatic visions to the stage, but his stage pictures -- his calling card -- are mechanical and overly familiar (2:50). The Flamboyán Theater in the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, between Delancey and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212)886-4551. (Zinoman)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)    'SILK STOCKINGS' A bubbly and amusing show about cold war politics and love that is still appealing 15 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The jokes are still funny. The songs are vintage Porter -- witty, sophisticated and lively (2:30). Florence Gould Hall in the French Institute Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, (212)307-4100. (Hampton)     Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)     Last Chance     'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100, closing Sunday. ( Brantley)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. . (Andrea Stevens)    'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200, closing Saturday. (Brantley)    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful, funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)      'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Manohla Dargis)    'CHAIN' (No rating, 99 minutes) Jem Cohen's sad, lyrical evocation of the homogeneity of the global landscape views it through the eyes of two young women: a Japanese corporate functionary researching theme parks in the United States and a glum temp worker eking out a living in shopping malls and motels. (Stephen Holden)  *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel.( Scott)     *'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael González (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)     'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)    'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)     'FINDING ELÉAZAR' (No rating, 78 minutes) This documentary follows the great operatic tenor Neil Shicoff as he prepares to sing the lead role in Halevy's 1835 opera, ''La Juive.'' (Holden)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)     'THE FUTURE OF FOOD' (No rating, 88 minutes) Deborah Koons Garcia's documentary polemic examines the history of genetically modified food and points an accusing finger at the biotech company Monsanto as a greedy villain. The heroes are organic farmers. (Holden)    *'GARÇON STUPIDE' (No rating, 94 minutes, in French) Loïc (Pierre Chatagny) is a gay Swiss man who works in a chocolate factory and spends his nights cruising the streets and the Internet for anonymous sex. An intriguing examination of alienation and dysfunction, with Mr. Chatagny entirely convincing as a disconcerting blend of emotional innocence and sexual proficiency. (Jeannette Catsoulis)     *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)       'I AM CUBA: THE SIBERIAN MAMMOTH' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Spanish, Portuguese and Russian) An illuminating documentary on the making of ''I Am Cuba,'' Mikhail Kalatozov's legendary 1964 film about revolutionary Cuba. (Scott)    * 'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)    *'KEANE' (R, 93 minutes) A man goes searching for his lost daughter -- or does he? The irony of this very fine film is that while the director Lodge Kerrigan's approach can verge on the entomological, he grants this troubled, difficult character the full measure of his humanity. (Dargis)     'LORD OF WAR' (R, 122 minutes) A misfire of a political satire about the international gun market from Andrew Niccol, a filmmaker whose words say no, but whose overworked visual style says lock and load, baby. (Dargis)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    *'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)      *'OCCUPATION: DREAMLAND' (No rating, 79 minutes) In early 2004, eight members of the United States Army's 82nd Airborne Division allowed the directors Ian Olds and Garrett Scott to shadow them for six weeks in a rapidly destabilizing Fallujah. The resulting film is a respectful and determinedly nonpartisan portrait of regular guys -- the smart and the average, the blusterers and the introverts, the gung-ho and the conflicted -- all doing their best to carry out inchoate orders in an untenable situation. (Catsoulis)    *'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)    'PROOF' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A terribly serious adaptation of David Auburn's prize-laden Broadway play, starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the daughter of a dead mathematician struggling to come to terms with both her father's legacy and her own troubled mind. (Dargis)    * 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). ( Holden)      'THUMBSUCKER' (R, 96 minutes) A better-than-usual coming-of-age story, via Sundance but without the usual sensationalism or condescension, and with some very fine performances, notably by Lou Pucci as a teenage boy with a childish habit. (Scott)    'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)     'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this purely shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a young boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus. (Kern)    * '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'AN UNFINISHED LIFE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) This contemporary Western starring Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman is a solemn, sentimental bore that suffocates in its own predictability and watered-down psychobabble. All three stars recycle stereotypes they've played before. (Holden)    'THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL' (No rating, 70 minutes) Keith A. Beauchamp's lean, harrowing documentary about the 50-year-old murder that catalyzed the civil rights movement offers new evidence that the crime was a broader conspiracy than originally thought. (Holden)    'VENOM' (R, 85 minutes) A zombie tow-truck driver terrifies teenagers in a swampy Louisiana town. Jim Gillespie's minor horror flick certainly can't be called a good movie, but within its genre, it's perfectly palatable and relatively uninsulting. (Anita Gates)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher.

(Sinagra)    TRACY CHAPMAN (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter's angsty alto pop-folk song ''Fast Car,'' a kind of anti-''Born To Run,'' became an instant classic when late-80's recession sunk in, offering a working-class escape fantasy so modest it was heartbreaking. 7 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155; $35. (Sinagra)    CITIZEN COPE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Clarence Greenwood, better known as Citizen Cope, emerged from the spaced-out hip-hop group Basehead to present himself as a songwriter, mixing the moans of Southern rock with the looped, leisurely constructions of downtempo hip-hop. 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $20 in advance, $22 at the door, $35 for a two-day pass.(Jon Pareles)    MARSHALL CRENSHAW POWER TRIO (Tomorrow) Marshall Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all, the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. 7 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $15. (Pareles)    DEERHOOF (Wednesday) This excitingly whimsical band harbors affection in equal amounts for No Wave angularity, exuberant noise-pop and outsider naif art like that of the Shaggs.

(Sinagra)    RUPEE (Tonight) Rupee began his career as a dancehall toaster and gravitated to soca and calypso.

(Sinagra)    ASHLEE SIMPSON (Wednesday) Playing rocker to her sister Jessica's dance-pop princess, Ms. Simpson proved sassy enough to power the enjoyable rock songs conceived for her. Of course, her notorious lip-sync malfunction and spontaneous ''hoedown'' dance on ''Saturday Night Live'' slowed her meticulously meteoric rise a smidge. 8 p.m., Supper Club, 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)921-1940; $47.50. (Sinagra)    SUPERGRASS (Tuesday) This buoyant, hooky mid-90's Brit-pop band had a sound more glammy than Oasis's and heftier than Blur's.

(Sinagra)    DWIGHT YOAKAM (Wednesday) Dwight Yoakam is a honky-tonk diehard, holding on to the Bakersfield country tradition of Buck Owens as he moans about the women who've broken his heart or done him wrong. His lyrics, which he recently published in book form, are models of concise storytelling; his songs find endless variations on classic honky-tonk forms, sometimes letting in a hint of folk-rock or Phil Spector.

(Chinen)    THE BAD PLUS (Through Sunday) The pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer David King irritated jazz purists a few years ago with a spate of irreverent cover tunes; on ''Suspicious Activity?''

(Chinen)    TIM BERNE (Tonight) With ''Feign'' (Screwgun), the alto saxophonist and composer Tim Berne continues to cultivate an unstable yet groovy approach to experimental chamber music; his bandmates are the slippery electric guitarist David Torn, the versatile keyboardist Craig Taborn and the dryly supple drummer Tom Rainey. 9:30 and 11:30, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)    PETER BRÖTZMANN TRIO (Tomorrow) Few modern saxophonists can sound as powerfully abrasive as Mr. Brötzmann; this group, with the comparably more mainstream rhythm team of Eric Revis on bass and Nasheet Waits on drums, might stir some melodic undercurrents. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen)    REGINA CARTER GROUP (Tuesday through Oct. 2) Ms. Carter is unquestionably one of jazz's top violinists, equally comfortable with burnished romanticism and blazing post-bop; she's also a confident bandleader, as she'll demonstrate here. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $25 to $30.

(Chinen)    LARRY CORYELL, VICTOR BAILEY AND LENNY WHITE (Through Sunday) Their new album, ''Electric'' (Chesky), works hard to deserve the moniker; it relies equally on Mr. Coryell's searing guitar, Mr. Bailey's blindingly proficient electric bass playing and Mr. White's earthy drumming. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212)582-2121; cover, $27.50 to $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    *MARILYN CRISPELL TRIO (Wednesday) Ms. Crispell, a pianist long known for an aggressively atonal style, has lately been extravagantly lyrical; this trio, with the Danish saxophonist Lotte Ancher and the American drummer Andrew Cyrille, should hover somewhere between the two extremes. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501; cover, $15; $12 in advance; with a one-drink minimum.(Chinen)    STEVE DAVIS sextet (Tonight and tomorrow night) Hard-bop is this trombonist's native tongue, but an apprenticeship with the keyboardist Chick Corea has attuned him more to texture; his band features the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212)885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Sunday) With ''Semi-Formal'' (Cuneiform), this improvising chamber ensemble renews its lease on textural and often contrapuntal experimentalism; Mr. Hollenbeck's drumming is one color on a palette that also includes Chris Speed's clarinet and tenor saxophone, Ted Reichman's accordion and Matt Moran's vibraphone. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212)989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    *KEITH JARRETT (Monday) Mr. Jarrett, one of jazz's best and most recognizable pianists, can still carry a hall with free-improvised and deeply expressive solo piano peregrinations; last year's live album, ''Radiance'' (ECM), provides a precedent but not a template for this concert, his first New York solo recital in a decade. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $45 to $100. (Chinen)    KIDD JORDAN/WILLIAM PARKER/HAMID DRAKE (Tomorrow) Boisterous free improvisation by Mr. Jordan, a New Orleans saxophone elder; Mr. Parker, a stalwart bassist; and Mr. Drake, a responsive and powerful drummer. 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177; cover, $10.

(Chinen)    KATHY KOSINS (Monday) On ''Vintage'' (Mahogany), Ms. Kosins's nonstandard choice of standards is almost as winsome as her easygoing, swinging style; here, as on the album, the singer is backed by a stellar band. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $15. (Chinen)    OLIVER LAKE/JOHN HICKS BIG BAND (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Lake is an alto saxophonist with a robust and piercing sound; Mr. Hicks is a pianist with an assertively rhythmic style.

OPERA    'ARIADNE AUF NAXOS' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The soprano Deborah Voigt has won so much acclaim for her portrayal of the title role of Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' that she has dubbed her career ''Ariadne Inc.'' She has been a Met favorite in the role. But there are other Ariadne's, and tomorrow afternoon the Met will give the dusky-voiced soprano Violeta Urmana a chance. The splendid mezzo-soprano Susan Graham sings the Composer, and the vibrant tenor Jon Villars makes his company debut as Bacchus. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LA BOHÈME' (Wednesday) Puccini's most popular opera has returned to heavy rotation at the Met in Franco Zeffirelli's lavish, audience-pleasing production. Hei-Kyung Hong sings the part of Mimì, and Roberto Aronica lends his sturdy tenor to the role of Rodolfo. The rest of the cast includes Alexandra Deshorties, Vladimir Chernov, Sebastian Catana and Richard Bernstein. Philippe Auguin conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $320. (Jeremy Eichler)    'CAPRICCIO'  (Tomorrow) Strauss's final opera, ''Capriccio'' poses an aesthetic question: In opera, which is more important, the words or the music? The issue is dramatized through a love triangle between Flamand, a composer, and Olivier, a poet, who are vying for the affection of a young widow, Countess Madeleine, in 18th-century France. For all its ingenuity and musical refinement, the opera can seem chatty and inert. To lend the work more immediacy, the director Stephen Lawless of this New York City Opera production updates the story to the mid-20th century and moves the setting from the countess's intimate salon to the inside of her fancy private opera house. Though the updating idea has its merits, Mr. Lawless turns the comedic scenes, which are already jarring, into laugh riots. Still, the cast, headed by the soprano Pamela Armstrong as the countess, is greatly appealing, and George Manahan conducts an assured and supple performance. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Tommasini)    'FALSTAFF' (Tonight and Monday night) These days the Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel owns the title role of ''Falstaff,'' Verdi's miraculous final opera. Mr. Terfel brings his portrayal back to the Met tonight. With James Levine, who reveres the score, conducting, and a strong cast, including Matthew Polenzani and Heidi Grant Murphy as the young lovers Fenton and Nannetta, this revival of Franco Zeffirelli's production looks promising. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $205. (Tommasini)    'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's Japanese classic is one of New York City Opera's best. And there's a lot else to like here, from the intermittently good conducting of Ari Pelto to Jake Gardner'sSharpless; but Brandon Jovanovich and Jee Hyun Lim don't quite have the voices to pull off the two leading roles. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30; Thursday night at 7:30; New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $45 to $120. (Anne Midgette)    'MANON' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's production of Massenet's tragedy, absent from the Met since 2001, returns with Renée Fleming as the conflicted Manon, and Marcelo Álvarez as a passionate, and unusually well-rounded, des Grieux. Both are in fine voice, and have the support of a well-balanced cast, as well as vibrant conducting by Jésus López-Cobos. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $42 to $320 on Saturday; $26 to $320 on Tuesday. (Allan Kozinn)    'PATIENCE' (Tonight) New York City Opera's jokey and brightly colored version of Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Patience'' has the distinct virtues of Michael Ball and Kevin Burdette in key roles. 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $45 to $120.(Bernard Holland)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive, venerable, and unbowed, the Amato Opera, a salty old-school denizen of New York, is presenting an even more venerable standby as the first production of its 58th season: Puccini's ''Tosca.'' Tomorrow night at 7:30; Sunday afternoon at 2:30; Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212)228-8200; $30; 65+, students with ID and children, $25. (Midgette)    'IL VIAGGIO A REIMS' (Sunday) Conceived as an over-the-top tribute to a leading politician, Rossini's ''Viaggio'' is a wacky, unserious froth of delightful bel canto singing and slapstick; and with 10 principal roles, it's a chance for the company to show off its young voices -- like those of Cheryl Evans, Maria Kanyova, Daniel Mobbs and Marcus DeLoach -- led by the capable George Manahan. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $45 to $120.(Midgette)    CLASSICAL MUSIC    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Sunday) After devoting two weekends in August to the theme of ''Aaron Copland and His World,'' the American Symphony Orchestra continues exploring the roots and offshoots of this country's native classical tradition.

In the first of his three concerts, he offers the three Opus 10 and two Opus 49 Sonatas, as well as the ''Waldstein'' (Op. 53). At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $33 to $45; students, $10. (Kozinn)    NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) Composers sometimes complain that they can get premieres of new work, but that second or third performances are much harder to come by. With this problem no doubt in mind, Joel Sachs leads his intrepid players in a program of works already given premieres by the ensemble within the last decade. The composers include Suren Zakarian, Jack Beeson, Kenji Bunch, Valentin Bibik and John Psathas. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, the Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406; free tickets have been distributed, but a standby line for seating begins at 7:30. (Eichler)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today through Thursday) The top of the Philharmonic season is certainly keyboard-heavy: Evgeny Kissin played Beethoven on opening night, but now the young Chinese firebrand Lang Lang has taken over, offering the Chopin Piano Concerto No.1, as an elaborate prelude to Lorin Maazel's rendering of the Mahler First Symphony. On Thursday, the pianist Jonathan Biss takes over the solo spot to play Mozart's Concerto in A (K. 488), and Mr. Maazel leads Elliott Carter's ''Holiday Overture'' and two works by Strauss.

(Midgette)    *ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC (Thursday) In some crucial ways, you haven't really heard the big works of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff until you've heard them played by this great orchestra under its longtime music director, Yuri Temirkanov.

(Dunning)    *'WATCHING LIGETI MOVE: THREE BALLETS BY CHRISTOPER WHEELDON' (Wednesday, next Friday and Oct. 1) To inaugurate its season and a festival devoted to the music of Gyorgy Ligeti, the Miller Theater will present dancers from the New York City Ballet and the San Francisco Ballet in three works choreographed by Mr. Wheeldon to Mr. Ligeti's music and never before presented in one program. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Columbia University, 2960 Broadway, at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799 or www.millertheatre.com.(Rockwell)    KRIOTA WILLBERG/DURA MATER (Tonight through Oct. 8) In her ambitious-sounding new multimedia work, ''Bentfootes,'' Ms. Willberg tells the story of 200 years of dance by the downtown choreographer Susan Bentfoote and her family. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8, Dixon Place at University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, (212)219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org; $10 to 15; T.D.F. accepted on Thursdays. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic ''outsider'' category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    *BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE CENTER FOR AMERICAN ART VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Roberta Smith)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia itself, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'AIM 25/ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE,' through Oct. 2. This show is the culminating event of an annual 12-week museum residency that focuses on the mechanics of career development. The work is as diverse as the backgrounds of the more than 30 artists, who all live in New York, though many were born elsewhere, including Brazil, Croatia, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Libya, Mexico and the Philippines. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718)681-6000.(Cotter)    MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13 . During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York City with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Grace Glueck)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or weaknesses, but is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art., 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600 (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'PAST PRESENCE: CHILDHOOD AND MEMORY,' through Oct. 13. This modestly resonant show of works relating to juvenile experience presents a glass cabinet filled with 2,000 miniature white ceramic vessels by Charles LeDray; small, finely drawn, photo-based pictures of children by Peggy Preheim; drawings copied from hunting manuals by Robert Beck; and a politically suggestive chalkboard drawing by Gary Simmons. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    MAURICE FREEDMAN: 'A RETROSPECTIVE' Though his paintings are not widely recognized today, Freedman (1904-85) enjoyed considerable success in pre-Abstract Expressionist New York for engagingly blending influences of Max Beckmann and Marsden Hartley. D. Wigmore, 22 East 76th Street, (212) 794-2128, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'BIRTH OF A CULTURE: 60'S AND 70'S SURF PHOTOGRAPHY BY LEROY GRANNIS' Big, new color prints of surfing action shot during the sport's golden age by a photographer who earned major awards for his work for surfing magazines and initiation into the International Surfing Hall of Fame. Bonni Benrubi, 41 East 57th Street, (212)888-6007, through Oct. 1. (Johnson)    'INTRODUCTIONS' Three solo minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    'FREDERICK SOMMER AT 100' This show economically surveys the career of one of America's most interesting if not best-known photographers. Sommer worked ingeniously in the space between Westonesque formalism and Surrealist fantasy and horror. Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212)759-7999, through Oct. 1. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    DENNIS ADAMS: 'MAKE DOWN' This brainy political artist presents a video in which he uses film stills from the movie ''Battle of Algiers'' to wipe dark green makeup off his face and body. It's about terrorism, gender, masking and unmasking. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212)627-3680, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)    ANN AGEE: 'BOXING IN THE KITCHEN' A ceramicist with a playful and not too fussy touch, Ms. Agee has created a whimsical, tabletop landscape in which painted terra-cotta representations of friends and family members in different sorts of costumes cavort among cartoonish pink rock formations. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, (212)647-1044, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'ASK THE DUST': JEDEDIAH CAESAR, CASE CALKINS, PATRICK HILL A substantial show featuring three young Los Angeles sculptors who pour, cast and stain their way to works that negotiate interesting truces between 1970's Process Art sculpture and 60's Formalist painting. Sheets of jagged glass, mounds of high-tech detritus and stacked balloons figure in the works, along with purple wood, white resin and pigmented plaster. Figuring out what was done and in which order is part of the fun. Everything has a fresh intelligence and an occasionally scary but affecting sense of precariousness. D'Amerlio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)352-9460, through Oct. 1. (Smith)    LAURA BATTLE Mathematically patterned spots and dots combine with fields of loose painterly abstraction in Ms. Battle's cosmically suggestive paintings and watercolors. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212)675-2656, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    *TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP'  A painter of eclectically layered abstractions has produced a surprising environmental installation: a slightly old-fashioned, fully equipped painter's studio made of brown corrugated cardboard and black paint. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, (212)727-8304, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    ADAM CVIJANOVIC: 'LOVE POEM (TEN MINUTES AFTER THE END OF GRAVITY)' With a deft, representational touch, Mr. Cvijanovic has painted an expansive, airy mural depicting what could be a scene in a Spielberg movie: a Los Angeles suburb that appears to have been violently uprooted and elevated into the sky. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212)929-5959, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    IAN HARTSHORNE: 'IF YOU GO DOWN TO THE WOODS TODAY'  This English landscape painter constructs moody images of vacation houses in woodsy settings. Alterations reflecting digital manipulations and distortions of his photographic sources add to the dreamy and slightly ominous effect. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through Oct. 1. (Johnson)    'I'M A CHILD OF DIVORCE GIMME A BREAK' The clear leader for best title of the moment. This exhibition, featuring media-saturated collages and sculptures by Michael St. John, and single works by 10 others, is worth a visit, too. Highlights include a sweet , glossy cartoon painting of a hippopotamus by Adrian Ting; a tenderly painted portrait of a cherubic demon by Elizabeth Olbert; a painterly Pop-style picture of a Bromo Seltzer bottle from 1984 by Walter Robinson; and aggressively physical abstract paintings by Suzanne McClelland, Gary Stephan and Josh Smith. Cynthia Broan, 546 West 29th Street, (212)760-0809, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'INTERSTATE' Organized by the artist Adam McEwen, ''Interstate'' continues last summer's Boys in Black trend of smart, dystopic group shows that rage against the status quo with counterculture bravado but include far too few artists of the opposite sex. However, the selection here tempers the summer's enthusiastic machismo with a more thoughtful and nuanced examination of the traffic between different realms, whether sexual, artistic, topographical or political. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212)243-3335, through Oct. 1. (Smith)    *PHILIP JONES GRIFFITHS For half a century, this documentary photographer has been placing himself squarely in harm's way to record military violence. His pictures of the American war in Vietnam, which make up a substantial part of this show, amount to one of the great tragic portraits of their time, and are required viewing in ours. Denise Bibro Fine Art Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fourth floor, (212)647-7030, through Oct. 1. (Cotter)    LAURA LARSON: 'APPARITION' For mysterious reasons, a lot of people these days are interested in photography of the supernatural. Ms. Larson creates rich color photographs of forest interiors and rooms in an abandoned psychiatric asylum in which wisps of smoke or mist suggest spiritual presences. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, (212)941-0012, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'MUD' This exceptional four-artist show of small sculpture features lively, insouciant ceramics by the painter Joanne Greenbaum; crusty, off-white ceramics by Elliott Levine that look like ancient artifacts; cartoonish sculptures about modern machines by Aga Ousseinov; and rough, semiabstract sculptures in Styrofoam and papier mâché, alluding to landscapes and furniture, by Yuh-Shioh Wong. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212)947-2818, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    DANICA PHELPS: 'WAKE' In her third solo show, this diligent Neo-Conceptualist keeps on keeping track in charts that record daily expenditures of time and money and in adept but similarly rotelike line drawings that show her bathing. The effect is mesmerizing but feels more and more like an interesting prelude to something completely different and less controlled. Zach Feuer Gallery (LFL), 530 West 24th Street, (212)989-7720, through Oct. 1. (Smith)    *MONIQUE PRIETO AND LYNDA BENGLIS Ms. Prieto has, in effect, boarded over her abstract paintings with rough-hewn monolithic letters quoting Samuel Pepys's famous diary. Both the wordiness and the klunkiness are a bit familiar, but extracting Pepys's phrases, which are all deliberately disembodied in reference, can be strangely satisfying. In ''The Graces,'' Ms. Benglis continues to evoke figures by other means, in this case three shimmering stacks of vaselike forms made of heavily textured, lavender-tinted resin. The material is perfect for the process-oriented Ms. Benglis, even if her current applications are similar to the work of Andrew Lord and Beverly Semmes. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Oct. 15. (Smith)    'BILL RICE: THE VIEW FROM 13 EAST 3RD'  The New York artist Bill Rice has been pioneeringly busy in so many disciplines over the last five decades, including writing, film and theater, that his art has been only sporadically visible. This small show is a chance to catch up with some of his paintings and collages from the 1960's onward. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, second floor, (212)242-6242 , through Oct. 8. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    GROUP SHOW This four-man show includes prints from the 1970's by Robert Rauschenberg and studies in popular iconography by Matt Mullican. The main interest, however, is in a series of large photographic collages by John Baldessari that play with visual rhymes and puns, and examples of the simulated Minimalist paintings called ''Surrogates'' that Allan McCollum started making more than 25 years ago. Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)925-4338, through Oct. 1. (Johnson)    SIMON MARTIN: 'WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON' Working against the grain of more flamboyant depictions of museums in recent art, this short video meditation on their ambiguities is a minor masterpiece of poetic discretion as well as the New York debut of a British artist known for keeping a low profile. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through Oct. 15. (Smith)    OHAD MEROMI: 'CYCLOPS' The jarring mixtures of mediums, narratives and genres in the video and installation work of this young Israel-born artist need more focus and entertainment value, but they smartly see that the field of set-up video is relatively open right now, with plenty of room for worlds to collide. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, South Village, (212)206-1290, through Oct. 8. (Smith)    Last Chance    *MET: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES' This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. Closing on Sunday. (See above.) (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE' A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400, closing on Monday. (Johnson)    *NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN' ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, closing on Monday. (Glueck)    *BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20-inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)714-9500, closing tomorrow.

Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE BLOWIN OF BAILE GALL' Ronan Noone's play concerns the complicated relationships among four laborers and a general contractor renovating a house in Ireland. Mr. Noone draws his characters sharply and surely, but the play is overburdened with conflict. There's enough here to fuel a whole season of a television soap (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful, funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'THE AUDITION' Nine actors perform monologues for judges and the audience, which votes to winnow them down to  six actors. This tame specimen of ''reality theater'' is more like auditing an average acting class than like watching a staged variation on ''American Idol'' (1:45). Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)696-7303.(Rob Kendt)    'THE BREADWINNER' My, there's a lot of dialogue in ''The Breadwinner,'' W. Somerset Maugham's comedy about a stockbroker named Charles (Jack Gilpin) who toils for the benefit of his ungrateful family, but it's worth choking down the wordiness for a dandy scene midway through in which he turns the tables on the smug leeches (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'HOLY CROSS  !' Rob Nash's infectious solo show, based on his years at a Jesuit high school in Texas, mines the 1980's for pop-culture references and for John Hughes-style narrative devices. But the nostalgia goes deeper than Izod and ''Purple Rain'' in this unexpectedly rich coming-of-age tale, made all the warmer by Mr. Nash's cool, unflappable demeanor (1:30). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. (Kendt)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.

(Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. Beginning Tuesday, Rosie O'Donnell joins the cast (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100.

(Brantley)    *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap, with Natasha Richardson, about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)    *'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs, and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)    *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Dargis)    'THE CAVE' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In Bruce Hunt's formulaic ''Cave,'' a group of ace cave-divers are flown in to investigate an intricate maze system discovered beneath the ruins of an ancient Romanian abbey, but instead become the prey of mutated demonlike creatures that can fly and see in the dark. Dreadfully dull, muddled and chaotic, with colorless and underdeveloped characters.(Laura Kern)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)  *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel.( Scott)    'CÔTE D'AZUR (CRUSTACÉS & COQUILLAGES)' (No rating, 90 minutes, in French) This pansexual French sex farce embellished with songs is neither funny nor sexy nor enlightening in the manner of the traditional Gallic sex comedy. (Stephen Holden)    *'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael González (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)    'GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS' (R, 109 minutes) A feature-length folly about the terrors and self-affirming joys of football (that is, soccer) hooliganism. (Dargis)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    'HARD GOODBYES: MY FATHER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Greek) Penny Panayotopoulou's emotionally charged drama, set in Athens in 1969, focuses on a mother and her two sons learning to cope with the sudden death of their husband/father, a traveling salesman who wasn't even a solid presence in the first place. The exceptionally bright and somewhat peculiar 10-year-old Elias, living in a fantasy world, adamantly refuses to believe that his father won't return. (Kern)    'HELLBENT' (No rating, 85 minutes) Out for a night of Halloween fun, four hunky friends are stalked by a totally buff masked killer, a cross between Batman and the Grim Reaper, who with a menacing, scythelike knife, slices his victims' heads cleanly off and keeps them as souvenirs. A compulsively watchable chiller that may just be the first entry in the gay slasher genre. (Kern)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)    * 'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    *'KAMIKAZE GIRLS' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Japanese) The girls of the film's title mostly just want to have fun (as does the director, Tetsuya Nakashima), which doesn't mean that their pretty little heads are empty. It's just that thinking seems more agreeable when you're wearing a frilly bonnet and peek-a-boo knee socks that make grown men cry. (Dargis)    *'KEANE' (R, 93 minutes) A man goes searching for his lost daughter -- or does he? The irony of this very fine film is that while the director Lodge Kerrigan's approach can verge on the entomological, he grants this troubled, difficult character the full measure of his humanity. (Dargis)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    'THE MAN' (PG-13, 83 minutes) Angry black man and nerdy white guy ride around the streets of Detroit looking for criminals. Nothing to see here. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    *'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)    *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    *'MUSIC FROM THE INSIDE OUT' (No rating, 90 minutes) Daniel Anker's profound and genuinely moving documentary ''Music From the Inside Out'' skillfully assembles insightful interviews with members of the prestigious Philadelphia Orchestra with snippets of an eclectic variety of music genres, including classical, bluegrass, jazz and world beats, capturing the power of the creative process in an uncommonly perceptive and inspiring way. (Kern)    'PIGGIE' (No rating, 90 minutes) Monotonous female coming-of-age story about a simple-minded teenager in upstate New York who becomes infatuated with a Ratso-like drifter. Aiming for documentary-style realism, the filmmakers achieve only badly lighted, awkwardly acted scenes that wobble as if captured from atop a mound of Jell-O.(Jeannette Catsoulis)    *'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)    * 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    * 'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)    *'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) In this delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, a lonely man awakens to life for the first time at 37 during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)    * 'TOUCH THE SOUND' (No rating, 99 minutes) As Thomas Riedelsheimer's enlightening, mystical documentary follows the deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie around the globe, it illustrates her understanding that sound is a physical sensation experienced throughout the body, as well as an auditory one. (Holden)    'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this purely shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a young boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus. (Kern)    * '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'AN UNFINISHED LIFE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) This contemporary Western starring Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman is a solemn, sentimental bore that suffocates in its own predictability and watered-down psychobabble. All three stars recycle stereotypes they've played before. (Holden)    'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in the voice-overs. (Holden)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    CMJ FILMFEST (Through Sept. 17) Advance screenings of fall 2005 films, held in tandem with the CMJ Music Marathon, conclude today with six movies.

(Chinen)    PAUL MOTIAN, JOE LOVANO, BILL FRISELL (Through Sunday) Mr. Motian, a drummer and composer, sets a tone for this blue-chip trio that's shadowy, slippery and open-ended as a koan; and there's no better place to see these musicians than at the Vanguard, where they've fruitfully recorded. 9 and 11 p.m., with an additional 12:30 a.m. set tomorrow night, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $25 tonight and tomorrow night, $20 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce no matter how dark or furious the extemporization; he's celebrating the release of a new CD, ''Live at Iridium, New York'' (Dreyfus), with the bassist Thomas Bramerie and the drummer Mark Mondesir. 8 and 10 p.m. with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212)582-2121; cover, $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    QUEST (Tonight and tomorrow night) Formed in 1981 and disbanded a decade later, this acoustic quartet often shrouded its exploratory ethos in gauzy romanticism; now the saxophonist Dave Liebman and the pianist Richie Beirach, the ensemble's founding core, are regrouping with the bassist Ron McClure and the drummer Billy Hart for an intriguing update. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    ADAM ROGERS GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) As on ''Apparitions'' (Criss Cross), the latest album by the guitarist Adam Rogers, this band features serpentine melodic lines and a rock-informed rhythmic thrust. 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $15, members, $10. (Chinen)    JIMMY SCOTT 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tuesday through Sept. 25) Mr. Scott's piercing singing voice and achingly emotional style are rightfully enshrined in the annals of songbook interpretation; this weeklong celebration will feature him with quartet backing and a parade of guest stars, including the chanteuse Dee Dee Bridgewater (Tuesday and Wednesday) and the tap dance phenom Savion Glover (Thursday). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $30 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum.

Opera    'LA BOHÈME' (Thursday) Puccini's most popular opera returns to heavy rotation at the Metropolitan Opera in Franco Zeffirelli's lavish, audience-pleasing production. The dependable Hei-Kyung Hong will sing the part of Mimì, and Roberto Aronica will lend his sturdy tenor to the role of Rodolfo. The rest of the cast includes Alexandra Deshorties, Vladimir Chernov, Sebastian Catana and Richard Bernstein. Philippe Auguin conducts. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $320. (Jeremy Eichler)    'CAPRICCIO' (Tonight and Sunday and Tuesday nights) Strauss's final opera, ''Capriccio'' poses an aesthetic question: In opera, which is more important, the words or the music? The issue is dramatized through a love triangle consisting of Flamand, a composer, and Olivier, a poet, who are vying for the affection of a young widow, Countess Madeleine, in 18th-century France. For all its ingenuity and musical refinement, the opera can seem chatty and inert. To lend the work more immediacy, the director Stephen Lawless updates the story to the mid-20th century and moves the setting from the countess's intimate salon to the inside of her fancy private opera house. Though the updating idea has its merits, Mr. Lawless turns the comedic scenes, which are already jarring, into laugh riots. Still, the cast, headed by the soprano Pamela Armstrong as the countess, is greatly appealing, and George Manahan conducts an assured and supple performance. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Anthony Tommasini)    'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) New York City Opera presents Puccini's Japanese classic in one of its best productions, a stripped-down but still Japanese abstraction by Mark Lamos, the director, and the set designer Michael Yeargan. There's a lot to like here, from the intermittently good conducting of Ari Pelto (which may improve as he gets more time with the orchestra) to Jake Gardner's Sharpless; but the two leads, Brandon Jovanovich and Jee Hyun Lim, don't quite have the voices to pull off their roles. Tomorrow night at 8, Wednesday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Anne Midgette)    'MANON' (Tuesday) Renée Fleming's explorations of repertory in recent years have taken her into coloratura roles in Handel and Bellini, far removed from the Mozart and Strauss lyric soprano repertory in which she first made her name. But the title role of Massenet's ''Manon'' remains central to her. In the past she has brought vocal radiance and piercing insight to her portrayal of the young heroine with a taste for finery who succumbs to the impulsive love of a dashing but shiftless chevalier. Ms. Fleming returns to the Metropolitan Opera to sing Manon in a revival of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1987 production. The ardent tenor Marcelo Álvarez sings the Chevalier des Grieux. Jesús López-Cobos conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $320. (Tommasini)    METROPOLITAN OPERA: OPENING NIGHT GALA (Monday) Opening night at the Met offers acts from Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' Puccini's ''Tosca'' and Saint-Saëns's ''Samson et Dalila.'' A big night with big ticket prices, with remaining seats at $250, $300, $600 and $1,000. 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. (Bernard Holland)    'PATIENCE' (Tomorrow) Gilbert and Sullivan's tart sendup of Victorian aesthetes gets psychedelic treatment from Tazewell Thompson's production by the New York City Opera. Michael Ball and Kevin Burdette are worth the trip. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $16 to $95.(Holland)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive, venerable and unbowed, the Amato Opera, a salty old-school denizen of New York, is presenting an even more venerable standby as the first production of its 58th season: Puccini's ''Tosca.'' Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, (212)228-8200; $30; 65+, students with ID and children, $25. (Midgette)    'IL VIAGGIO A REIMS' (Thursday) Conceived as an over-the-top tribute to a leading politician, which the composer withdrew after its premiere and recycled in several more normal operas, ''Viaggio'' is a wacky, unserious froth of delightful singing and slapstick. With 10 principal roles, it's a chance for New York City Opera to show off what it has in the way of voices: Cheryl Evans, Maria Kanyova, Daniel Mobbs and Marcus DeLoach are among the familiar faces, with Alison Tupay and Allyson McHardy among the debutantes. George Manahan, a capable conductor though no bel canto specialist, conducts. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets: $16 to $95. (Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music. This weekend, a chamber orchestra called the Knights will somehow cram itself on and around the tiny barge stage for works by Mozart, Bartok, Brahms and Hossein Alizadeh. Thursday, a piano trio (David Salness, violin; Evelyn Elsing, cello; Rita Sloan, piano) takes over for music by Saint-Saëns, Schumann and Shulamit Ran. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083; $50; 62+, $40; Thursday, $35; 62+, $30. (Eichler)    CHOIR OF CLARE COLLEGE (Thursday) This choir, from Cambridge, is joining forces with the superb resident boys' choir at St. Thomas Church to celebrate the 60th birthday of John Rutter, the English choral composer. The program includes Mr. Rutter's Mass of the Children, as well as a new piece by Nico Muhly, a New York composer, and works by Britten, Harris and Howells. 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212)664-9360; $15 to $60.(Allan Kozinn)    TON KOOPMAN YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Monday) Mr. Koopman, a Dutch Bach specialist, has been spending the week tutoring an international group of talented young choristers and instrumentalists in Baroque performance style in a workshop sponsored by Carnegie Hall. Here, in performances of Bach's Cantatas Nos. 6, 146 and 198, they show off the results, which, to judge from early returns in rehearsal, should be impressive. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $15. (James R. Oestreich)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Lorin Maazel and his orchestra are opening the season with a burst of flashy pianism and mainstream Romantic grandeur. On opening night, the Russian virtuoso Evgeny Kissin plays the Beethoven ''Emperor'' Concerto on a program that also includes two Strauss works: ''Don Juan'' and the ''Rosenkavalier'' Suite. And to open the orchestra's subscription series, on Thursday, the kinetic Chinese pianist Lang Lang joins Mr. Maazel and the orchestra for the Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1 on the first part of a program otherwise devoted to the Mahler First Symphony. Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; there is also an open rehearsal on Thursday at 9:45 a.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5656; both concerts are sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office. Tickets for the rehearsal are $15. (Kozinn)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

Her new work is divided into two parts: ''Lessons About Swansongs'' and ''Cello Lessons.'' They are likely to be lessons worth learning. 8 p.m., Bernie West Theater, Baruch Performing Arts Center, 17 Lexington Avenue, at 23rd Street, ninth floor, (646)312-4085; $25.

The artists began work on their pieces on Monday, when they were taken to the site for the first time. Whether or not the warehouse proves inspirational, this is an intriguing grouping of artists and an opportunity to see a sampler of their work. 2 and 4 p.m., Tobacco Warehouse, Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, Brooklyn, (212)625-3505, www.dancinginthestreets.org; free.

(Roberta Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Holland Cotter)    *MET: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES,' through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. (See above.) (Smith)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'AIM 25/ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE,' through Oct. 30. This show is the culminating event of an annual 12-week museum residency that focuses on the mechanics of career development. The work is as diverse as the backgrounds of the more than 30 artists, who all live in New York, though many were born elsewhere, including Brazil, Croatia, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Libya, Mexico and the Philippines. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718)681-6000. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13 . During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York City with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or weaknesses, but is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600 (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'PAST PRESENCE: CHILDHOOD AND MEMORY,' through Oct. 13. This modestly resonant show of works relating to juvenile experience presents a glass cabinet filled with 2,000 miniature white ceramic vessels by Charles LeDray; small, finely drawn, photo-based pictures of children by Peggy Preheim; drawings copied from hunting manuals by Robert Beck; and a politically suggestive chalkboard drawing by Gary Simmons. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among the nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    MAURICE FREEDMAN: 'A RETROSPECTIVE' Though his paintings are not widely recognized today, Freedman (1904-85) enjoyed considerable success in pre-Abstract Expressionist New York for engagingly blending influences of Max Beckmann and Marsden Hartley. D. Wigmore, 22 East 76th Street, (212) 794-2128, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'BIRTH OF A CULTURE: 60'S AND 70'S SURF PHOTOGRAPHY BY LEROY GRANNIS' Big, new color prints of surfing action shot during the sport's golden age by a photographer who earned major awards for his work for surfing magazines and initiation into the International Surfing Hall of Fame.

(Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    ANN AGEE: 'BOXING IN THE KITCHEN' A ceramicist with a playful and not too fussy touch, Ms. Agee has created a whimsical, tabletop landscape in which painted terra-cotta representations of friends and family members in different sorts of costumes cavort among cartoonish pink rock formations. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, (212)647-1044, through Oct. 8.

Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212)675-2656, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'BONDS OF LOVE' This show of insouciant works, all by women, organized by the artist and performer Lisa Kirk can be viewed as a modest update of the New Museum's landmark 1994 exhibition titled ''Bad Girls.''

(Johnson)    IAN HARTSHORNE: 'IF YOU GO DOWN TO THE WOODS TODAY'  This English landscape painter constructs moody images of vacation houses in woodsy settings. Alterations reflecting digital manipulations and distortions of his photographic sources add to the dreamy and slightly ominous effect. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through Oct. 1. (Johnson)    *JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)    DANICA PHELPS: 'WAKE' In her third solo show, this diligent Neo-Conceptualist keeps on keeping track in charts that record daily expenditures of time and money and in adept but similarly rotelike line drawings that show her bathing. The effect is mesmerizing but feels more and more like an interesting prelude to something completely different and less controlled. Zach Feuer Gallery (LFL), 530 West 24th Street, (212)989-7720, through Oct. 1. (Smith)    *BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20-inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical.

(Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ARTISTS AND PATRONS IN TRADITIONAL AFRICAN CULTURES: AFRICAN SCULPTURE FROM THE GARY SCHULZE COLLECTION'  Queensborough Community College has quietly assembled an impressive collection of African art.

And this summer the gallery is presenting a temporary exhibition of nearly 100 sculptures from a private collection. Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, the City University of New York, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, Queens, (718)631-6396, through Sept. 30. (Cotter)    GROUP SHOW This four-man show includes prints from the 70's by Robert Rauschenberg and studies in popular iconography by Matt Mullican. The main interest, however, is in a series of large photographic collages by John Baldessari that play with visual rhymes and puns, and examples of the simulated Minimalist paintings called ''Surrogates'' that Allan McCollum started making more than 25 years ago. Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)925-4338, through Oct. 1. (Johnson)    SIMON MARTIN: 'WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON' Working against the grain of more flamboyant depictions of museums in recent art, this short video meditation on their ambiguities is a minor masterpiece of poetic discretion as well as the New York debut of a British artist known for keeping a low profile. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through Oct. 15. (Smith)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook in which he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, closing today. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART, 'LANDSCAPE' With only 20 works dispersed throughout the Whitney's second floor, this startlingly fresh installation of recent art from its collection uses space in an exhilarating way, while weaving a cat's cradle of intersecting meanings, emotions, forms and processes through the landscapes of American art and history. It turns out that the less you look at, the more you can see, especially in an arrangement orchestrated by someone who believes that the best tool for coaxing out an artwork's polymorphous content is another piece of art. This someone is Donna De Salvo, the museum's new associate director for programs and curator of collections; her Whitney debut should be seen by anyone interested in the craft and art of curating. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600, closing on Sunday.

Winters and Stephen Sislen's musical is about two best friends and the rocker who comes between them (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)(212)239-6200.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA' Three decades after it first charmed critics with its insouciance, John Guare and Mel Shapiro's adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy, with throwaway songs by Galt MacDermot, tastes less like vintage Champagne than a fruity sangria. But isn't sangria the right drink for a sultry night in the park? Directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, with a peppy young cast that includes the ravishing Rosario Dawson (2:45). The Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater, Central Park, entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West, and at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. (An article on summer films is on Page 1 of Weekend.)    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap, with Natasha Richardson, about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)    *'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs, and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)    'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)    *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Dargis)    'THE CAVE' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In Bruce Hunt's formulaic ''Cave,'' a group of ace cave-divers are flown in to investigate an intricate maze system discovered beneath the ruins of an ancient Romanian abbey, but instead become the prey of mutated demonlike creatures that can fly and see in the dark. Dreadfully dull, muddled and chaotic, with colorless and underdeveloped characters.(Laura Kern)    'THE CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) This documentary, a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Freud's seminal theory of the unconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Stevens)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel.( Scott)    *'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. (Scott)    'DEUCE BIGALOW: EUROPEAN GIGOLO' (R, 77 minutes) In a sequel to the 1999 hit, the schlubby escort lands in Amsterdam to make lovelorn ladies feel whole, but the entire ordeal is mockery disguised as self-help. This insulting comedy is out of step with the culture, the times and the rebranded Adam Sandler, who was a producer and bit player in this mess. (Ned Martel)    *'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael González (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'ETERNAL' (No rating, 108 minutes) Lush, lurid and completely besotted with itself, ''Eternal'' claims inspiration from the life of Erszebet Bathory, a 16th-century Hungarian countess whose antiaging routine required frequent immersions in young, female blood. Merging low art and high production values, this is one of the dullest, least sexy lesbian vampire movies ever made. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Stephen Holden)    'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie, which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)    * 'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    *'MARGARET CHO: THE ASSASSIN TOUR' (No rating, 85 minutes) A live taping of Ms. Cho's standup performance on May 14, 2005, at the Warner Theater in Washington. Equal parts inspired clown, committed activist and ferocious Republican-baiter, Ms. Cho seeks out the bruises on American culture and gleefully applies pressure. (Catsoulis)    *'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)    * 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    'THE SKELETON KEY' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Kate Hudson in a T-shirt and underwear, intimations of unspeakable evil, slamming doors and equally slamming edits, and an introductory course in hoodoo, a folk religion born in the South -- all this and Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and John Hurt, too. (Dargis)    * 'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)    'A SOUND OF THUNDER' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A bloated, incoherent adaptation of a spare, elegant Ray Bradbury story. ''This can't be good,'' one character remarks. No, indeed. (Scott)    'STEAL ME' (No rating, 95 minutes) When a 15-year-old kleptomaniac lands in rural Montana searching for his prostitute mother, his arrival sends waves of sexual excitement through every female within pheromone-sniffing distance. Overheated material redeemed by natural performances and a screenplay that probes the bond between mothers and sons with unusual fearlessness. (Catsoulis)    *'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) In this delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, a lonely man awakens to life for the first time at 37 during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)    'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this purely shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a young boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus. (Kern)    * '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'USHER' (No rating, playing with three shorts with a total running time of 95 minutes) A 40-minute version of Edgar Allan Poe's ''Fall of the House of Usher,'' which favors literateness over melodrama and psychological kinks over special effects. Directed by Curtis Harrington with old-fashioned stateliness, ''Usher'' may be stilted but it is also quite touching. Accompanied by three of the director's early shorts. (Catsoulis)    'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in the voice-overs. (Holden)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    9/11/03: A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NEW YORK (Sunday) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater concludes its run of Richard Karz's documentary about the second anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks. New Yorkers who share their thoughts and opinions on that day include Ray Kelly, the police commissioner; Russell Simmons, the hip-hop mogul; Joe Torre, the Yankees manager; the Rev. Al Sharpton; Shirin Neshat, an Iranian-born artist and filmmaker; Dolly Lenz, a real estate broker; and Ti-Hua Chang, the local television news reporter. 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village, (212)591-0434; $9.

(Gates)    PINEWOOD DIALOGUES (Tuesday) The Museum of the Moving Image presents its third in a series of filmmaker dialogues. A discussion with David Cronenberg follows a screening of Mr. Cronenberg's new film, ''A History of Violence,'' a drama about a small-town diner owner (Viggo Mortensen) who kills two would-be robbers. 7 p.m., 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; $18. (Gates)    REPERTORY NIGHTS (Through Nov. 6) The Museum of the Moving Image continues its annual film series with ''Persona'' (1966), Ingmar Bergman's psychodrama about an actress (Liv Ullmann) recovering from a nervous breakdown who has an unusual effect on her nurse (Bibi Andersson). It will be screened tomorrow and Sunday. Other auteurs represented in the festival include Akira Kurosawa, F.W. Murnau, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and François Truffaut.

(Gates)    TRUTH AND DARE: NEW YORK KOREAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) BAMcinématek's festival of recent films from Korea, now in its fifth year, continues this weekend. Features include Kim Tae-Kyun's ''Romance of Their Own'' (2004), a romantic comedy about a country girl who moves to Seoul; Lee Jae-Han's ''Moment to Remember'' (2004), a drama about a happily married couple dealing with the wife's Alzheimer's disease; and Ahn Byeong-Ki's horror hit ''Bunshinsaba'' (2004). BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ABC (Tonight) This suave 1980's band delivered sly, cabaret-ready radio hits like ''Poison Arrow'' and ''Look of Love'' on a shiny silver platter. 8, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212)941-8100, $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Laura Sinagra)    AESOP ROCK, BLACKALICIOUS, LADY SOVEREIGN, APSCI (Thursday) The self-deprecating rapper Aesop Rock and the conscious hip-hoppers Blackalicious are charming if not explosive. Few M.C.'s ride the jerky rhythms of grime, a British mix of hip-hop and techno, quite like the adorably brash 17-year-old Lady Sovereign. The Brooklyn-based husband-and-wife duo Apsci serve up beats that slide from synth-electro to glitch electronica. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $20. (Sinagra)    AMADOU AND MARIAM, LAURA VIERS (Thursday) Amadou and Mariam, a duo who met in a school for the blind in Mali, build their pop from relatively traditional materials; their songs start out sweetly and spiral upward with increasing passion. Lately they've worked with the eclectic world-music producer Manu Chao. The ethereal but edgy singer-songwriter Laura Viers opens at this CMJ event. 8:30 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-0212, $25. (Jon Pareles)    MARC ANTHONY, ALEJANDRO FERNÁNDEZ (Tonight) Mr. Anthony is the biggest-selling salsa artist of all time; he is still passionately riding the rhythm as well as reportedly coaching his new wife, Jennifer Lopez, on the finer points of full-bodied singing. Mr. Fernández, the Mexican crooner, sings sweeping love ballads as well as mariachi standards. 7, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $49.50 to $129. 50. (Sinagra)    DEVENDRA BANHART (Wednesday) Devendra Banhart's eerie, wavery voice and stream-of-consciousness songs reach back to the childlike surrealism of some of psychedelia's most beloved oddballs: Syd Barrett and the preglam rock of Marc Bolan. This CMJ bill also includes the rapper Beans, the British garage partiers the Cribs and the yelping bashers King of France. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15 (sold out). (Sinagra)    BLOC PARTY, THE KILLS, NOISETTES (Tonight) Many bands steal sounds from the danceable punk of the early 80's, but few do it with the enthusiasm of Britain's Bloc Party. It is joined by the lanky rock duo the Kills and the Noisettes, who play shouty funk-pop with vocals recalling the X-Ray Spex. 6:45, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $25. (Sinagra)    GREG BROWN (Tomorrow) Greg Brown has quietly become one of the luminaries of the folky circuit. In his songs, cautious optimism slow-dances with resolute melancholy. He anatomizes despair with the droll familiarity of someone who expects to be stuck there for a while. His voice is a low growl shading toward a whisper; his tunes, set to his fingerpicked acoustic guitar, have the homey simplicity of hymns, waltzes or the blues. 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $25. (Pareles)    CIRCLE JERKS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Led by the outspoken frontman Keith Morris, this seminal West Coast punk band fuses gross-outs with a blunt, anti-establishment critique. 7, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $40. (Sinagra)    DOVES (Wednesday) Doves bring a rough ''Madchester'' dance pedigree to their sweeping guitar pop, making this trio's music slightly edgier than that of other British acts, like Coldplay. Also on this CMJ bill are Marjorie Fair and Unbusted. 7 p.m., Warsaw at the Polish National Home, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212)645-5156, $30. (Sinagra)    DUNGEN (Thursday) This Swedish band's biker-rock combines humongous riffing with whimsical jams, conjuring both black-leather aggression and the pastoral wonder of the open road. Also on this CMJ bill are the glam-metal Diamond Nights and the metal folkies Tarantula A.D. 9:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15.(Sinagra)    FEIST (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Canadian bohemian Feist is good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best cabaret-pop songs are quirky jazz numbers; she sounds like a hipper Norah Jones. Tuesday at 8:30 p.m., with the Canadian folk-pop band Great Lake Swimmers, which records its hushed music in abandoned silos and rural churches, $20. Wednesday she headlines a seven-band CMJ slate starting at 7 p.m. at the Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $20. (Sinagra)    DIAMANDA GALAS (Tonight) There are no small emotions for Ms. Galas, whose compositions are music theater with its rawest nerves exposed. She takes up fear and rage, mourning and vengeance; her voice can reach operatic heights or slice through a room with primal moans and shrieks and sobs. This is the East Coast debut of ''Defixiones, Orders From the Dead,'' a ''sacred operatic mass.'' 8, Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212)279-4200, $15 to $35. (Pareles)    GREAT JEWISH ARTISTS PERFORM GREAT JEWISH COMPOSERS (Tuesday) The program of this year's Jewish Music Heritage Festival's opening night seems to have been conceived by the wicked minds who pair up the presenters for MTV awards shows. It features the Klezmatics performing songs by Randy Newman; the experimental jazz guitarist Marc Ribot assaying Billy Joel; the jazzy klezmer group Pharoah's Daughter doing Carly Simon; and the Russian-born singer and pianist (and Strokes collaborator) Regina Spektor taking on both the work of Leonard Cohen and that of the Kabbalah evangelist ''Esther,'' better known as Madonna. Uri Caine and Tovah Feldshuh pay homage to Copland and the Gershwins. The hasidic reggae musician Matisyahu performs the folk songs of Shlomo Carlebach. 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500; V.I.P. seating, $125, general, $48. (Sinagra)    HEAD OF FEMUR (Thursday) With distorted and stuttered guitar and falsetto vocals, Head of Femur blurts its impressions and confessions, urged on by horns that seem to have strayed from the football field to the hangout under the bleachers. This CMJ bill includes the Scotland Yard Gospel Choir and Le Concorde, who play later slots. 10:45 p.m., Arlene's Grocery, 95 Stanton Street, one block below Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-1633, $7. (Sinagra)    JACK JOHNSON (Monday and Tuesday) This easygoing, sandal-shod surf dude plays strummy mellow-out music for extreme sports fans' extremely sensitive moods. Monday and Tuesday at 6 p.m., Central Park, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, jackjohnsontickets.musictoday.com; $37.50 in advance, $40 at the event. (Sinagra)    SEU JORGE (Sunday and Monday) The Brazilian singer Seu Jorge may be best known here for his lilting samba covers of David Bowie songs in Wes Anderson's movie ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.'' His music avoids the traditional Brazilian styles, favoring crowd-pleasing funk-pop and loverman R&B. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    KANINE RECORDS NIGHT (Wednesday) The Brooklyn label Kanine offers a CMJ lineup of top-notch quirky bands like the noise-folk wackos Grizzly Bear, the shaggy art-rockers Oxford Collapse, the electro-poppers Mixel Pixel, the electro-punks Mommy and Daddy and the pop-punkers Four Voltz. 7:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212)420-1466, $10 in advance and $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    LITTLE BROTHER (Thursday) This soul-grounded Durham, N.C., rap group forgoes Southern crunk in favor of blending the free-form experimentation of Outkast with the kind of jazzy tracks that characterized East Coast hip-hop of the mid-90's. The bill includes the rapper J-Live and the D.J. Mark Ronson, starting at 8 p.m.; Little Brother plays at 12:15 a.m. B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, $18. (Sinagra)    LOOKOUT RECORDS SHOWCASE (Thursday) This great CMJ showcase features the whimsical indie rocker Mary Timony (12 a.m.), the pleasantly droney pop of the Oranges Band (11 p.m.), the hard-riffing wit of Hockey Night and the catchy screeds of Elizabeth Elmore's Reputation (8 p.m.). Troubled Hubble and the Dollyrots also play. Show starts at 7 p.m.; $12, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212)475-7088, $12. (Sinagra)    J MASCIS (Sunday) He reunited earlier this summer for a few shows with the original lineup of Dinosaur Jr., his seminal rock band that melded the apathetic cool of American punk with the guitar blare of classic rock. He plays solo here for CBGB, which has lost its lease but continues to fight to stay open. 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $20.(Sinagra)    THE NATIONAL, CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH (Tonight) The National is a group of New York-based Ohio natives who play a kind of pent-up, countrified indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. The Brooklyn quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah recalls the shamanic whine and thrum of the mid-1990's lo-fi rocker Neutral Milk Hotel and sometimes the paranoid quirkiness of the Talking Heads. 8:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15 (sold out).(Sinagra)    THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS (Thursday) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until the voice of Neko Case cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. 5 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)    NEW YORK SALSA FESTIVAL: VICTOR MANUELLE, INDIA, TITO ROJAS, OSCAR D'LEON, SONORA PONCEÑA (Tomorrow) This 30th annual collection of salsa musicians includes Victor Manuelle, one of the most important soneros of his generation, with brassy, hard-swinging declamations of love songs and soaring improvisations traded with the band. The brash-voiced India has teamed up with musicians like Eddie Palmieri, Marc Anthony and Tito Puente. Tito Rojas has been one of the leading Puerto Rican salsa singers since the 1980's, making hits with both ballads and dance tunes. The suavely forceful Venezuelan singer Oscar D'Leon leads a high-powered dance band that holds on to the best aspects of 1970's and 80's salsa. La Sonora Ponceña has been one of the cornerstones of Puerto Rican salsa since it was founded in 1954. Its arrangements are at once transparent and propulsive, with pinpoint horns, percussion and keyboard behind ardent vocals. 7 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $39.50 to $ 99.50. (Pareles)    NOUVELLE VAGUE (Tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday) These French multi-instrumentalists have hit upon a lucrative shtick, covering jittery post-punk gems like Joy Division's dark, swirling ''Love Will Tear Us Apart'' as dispassionate bossa nova chill music. Tomorrow and Tuesday, 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)239-6200, $18 to $20. Wednesday, 9 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212)941-8100; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    ROLLING STONES (Tuesday) The band's newest album is its most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages at what could be President Bush's most vulnerable moment, the Stones even seem politically relevant. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra)    SIGUR ROS, AMINA (Monday and Tuesday) The Icelandic atmospherists Sigur Ros continue to pursue the hope and dread of open expanse and conjure with their sung gibberish a kind of ur-poetry. Amina is an all-female string quartet that similarly muses on vastness. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070, $33.50 to $50. (Sinagra)    REGINA SPEKTOR, DEVOTCHKA (Thursday) Ms. Spektor's music is of the jaggedly quirky cabaret variety. It brings punk immediacy into a chamber setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and slightly unhinged melodrama. She is joined by the Gyspy punk band DeVotchKa. Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    WIDE RIGHT (Tomorrow) This rocking bar band features one of the more winsome singer-guitarists around in the person of the chatty, no-nonsense frontwoman Leah Archibald.

BAUHAUS QUARTET (Tuesday) Kevin Norton is a probing drummer, vibraphonist and composer, although not always in that order; his Bauhaus Quartet, which becomes a quintet here with the addition of the pianist Angelica Sanchez, exemplifies the taut intellectualism of jazz's far-left wing. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.(Nate Chinen)    DAVE BINNEY AND FRIENDS (Through Sunday) Mr. Binney, a graceful yet gutsy alto saxophonist, enlists a handful of marquee collaborators, including the guitarist Adam Rogers and the drummer Brian Blade.

The production has its debut at the New York City Opera tomorrow. This 1881 operetta invites the broad humor and snappy choreography that Mr. Tazewell has come up with. Gilbert and Sullivan poke fun at the aesthetics movement then championed by Oscar Wilde. A group of 20 lovesick maidens, who will only consider engagements to men of high-minded artistic sensibilities, are torn between two effete poets, Reginald Bunthorne and Archibald Grosvenor. But the rival poets find themselves smitten by the innocent milkmaid Patience, who cares nothing for their verses and believes in a truer, more romantic form of love. The musical theater actor and singer Michael Ball makes his City Opera debut as Reginald, with Kevin Burdette as Archibald and Tonna Miller as Patience. Gary Thor Wedow conducts.

This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. (See above.) (Smith)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'AIM 25/ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE,' through Oct. 30. This show is the culminating event of an annual 12-week museum residency that focuses on the mechanics of career development. The work is as diverse as the backgrounds of the more than 30 artists, who all live in New York, though many were born elsewhere, including Brazil, Croatia, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Libya, Mexico and the Philippines. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718)681-6000. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13 . During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York City with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or weaknesses, but is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    *NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART, 'LANDSCAPE,' through Sept. 18. With only 20 works dispersed throughout the Whitney's second floor, this startlingly fresh installation of recent art from its collection uses space in an extravagant, exhilarating way, while weaving a cat's cradle of intersecting meanings, emotions, forms and processes through the landscapes of American art and history. It turns out that the less you look at, the more you can see, especially in an arrangement orchestrated by someone who believes that the best tool for coaxing out an artwork's polymorphous content is another piece of art. This someone is Donna De Salvo, the museum's new associate director for programs and curator of collections; her Whitney debut should be seen by anyone interested in the craft and art of curating. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Smith)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. (See above.) (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'PAST PRESENCE: CHILDHOOD AND MEMORY,' through Oct. 13. This modestly resonant show of works relating to juvenile experience presents a glass cabinet filled with 2,000 miniature white ceramic vessels by Charles LeDray; small, finely drawn, photo-based pictures of children by Peggy Preheim; drawings copied from hunting manuals by Robert Beck; and a politically suggestive chalkboard drawing by Gary Simmons. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among the nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook in which he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)    Galleries: 57th Street    'BIRTH OF A CULTURE: 60'S AND 70'S SURF PHOTOGRAPHY BY LEROY GRANNIS' Big, new color prints of surfing action shot during the sport's golden age by a photographer who earned major awards for his work for surfing magazines and initiation into the International Surfing Hall of Fame. Bonni Benrubi, 41 East 57th Street, (212)888-6007, through Oct. 1. (Johnson)    'INTRODUCTIONS' Three solo minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    *'REPEAT PERFORMANCE'  More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    *JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)    'ON VIEW: PHOTOGRAPHING THE MUSEUM' Among 20 well-selected ways of picturing the museum are Elliot Erwitt's view of a naked sculptural Diana aiming her arrow at an unsuspecting live male visitor; wax figures by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Diane Arbus; a specimen drawer full of cardinals (birds, that is) by Terry Evans; and the dreamlike image of three real foxes in a formal period room by Karen Knorr. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    *BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20-inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ARTISTS AND PATRONS IN TRADITIONAL AFRICAN CULTURES: AFRICAN SCULPTURE FROM THE GARY SCHULZE COLLECTION'  Queensborough Community College has quietly assembled an impressive collection of African art. A year ago, the college inaugurated a permanent display of the collection in its campus gallery. And this summer the gallery is presenting a temporary exhibition of nearly 100 sculptures from a private collection. Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, the City University of New York, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, Queens, (718)631-6396, through Sept. 30. (Cotter)    'EXILE, NEW YORK IS A GOOD HOTEL' This new gallery, established by the German-based critic and curator Anke Kempkes, offers a spectacular view of the Empire State Building and a show of work by young artists from Berlin, Glasgow and Warsaw, along with a collaborative slide piece by the New Yorkers Ken Okiishi and Nick Mauss. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, near 28th Street, Apt. 1602, (212)481-0362, through Sept. 16, by appointment. (Cotter)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    'ALONG THE WAY: M.T.A. ARTS FOR TRANSIT' This extensive survey of artworks commissioned over the last two decades by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is more that just a promotional event. Including paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures by dozens of well-known artists, it is a fascinating window onto an artscape usually only glimpsed by commuters in bits and pieces. UBS, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212)713-2885, closing today.(Johnson)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT' From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040, closing on Sunday. (Glueck)    'ANOTHER EXPO: BEYOND THE NATION STATE' An international group of eight politically minded Conceptualists takes on nationalism. The most striking work is Marina Abramovic's large staged photograph of herself sitting in a mournful posture on a pile of bloody bones. White Box, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)714-2347, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, closing tomorrow, by appointment. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION'  A selection of fair to good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, closing on Sunday. (Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO' The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures, closing on Monday. (See above.) (Cotter)    * NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA' This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    'A.B. NORMAL'  Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyperrealistic Zamboni made of rigid pale-green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    'PRECIOUS MOMENTS' Mall culture, with its peculiar poignancies, is the theme of ''Precious Moments,'' a smart, sad five-person show organized by the artist Josh Kline. Joymore, 236 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (646)270-0376, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, closing on Thursday.

Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt, despite the presence of a top-flight cast led by Nathan Lane (2:15). Beginning Tuesday, Don Amendolia replaces Mr. Lane. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint in Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful, funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA' Three decades after it first charmed critics with its insouciance, John Guare and Mel Shapiro's adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy, with throwaway songs by Galt MacDermot, tastes less like vintage Champagne than a fruity sangria. But isn't sangria the right drink for a sultry night in the park? Directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, with a peppy young cast that includes the ravishing Rosario Dawson (2:45). The Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater, Central Park, entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West, and at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. Reopening Thursday. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Mr. Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the show feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. (An article on summer films is on Page 1 of Weekend.)    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap with Natasha Richardson about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)    *'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)    'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)    *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who gets left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)    'BEWITCHED'(PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Dargis)    'THE CAVE' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In Bruce Hunt's formulaic ''The Cave,'' a group of ace cave-divers are flown in to investigate an intricate maze system discovered beneath the ruins of an ancient Romanian abbey, but instead become the prey of mutated demonlike creatures that can fly and see in the dark. Dreadfully dull, muddled and chaotic, with colorless and underdeveloped characters.(Laura Kern)    'THE CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) This documentary, a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Freud's seminal theory of the subconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Stevens)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    *'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. (Scott)    'DEUCE BIGALOW: EUROPEAN GIGOLO' (R, 77 minutes) In a sequel to the 1999 hit, the schlubby escort lands in Amsterdam to make lovelorn ladies feel whole, but the entire ordeal is mockery disguised as self-help. The insulting comedy is out of step with the culture, the times and the rebranded Adam Sandler, who was a producer and bit player in this mess. (Ned Martel)    *'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael González (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'ETERNAL' (No rating, 108 minutes) Lush, lurid, and completely besotted with itself, ''Eternal'' claims inspiration from the life of Erszebet Bathory, a 16th-century Hungarian countess whose antiaging routine required frequent immersions in young, female blood. Merging low art and high production values, this is one of the dullest, least sexy lesbian vampire movies ever made. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    'FORMULA 17' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Mandarin) A silly-sweet gay romantic comedy aimed primarily at teenagers and college-age audiences, this tale of a virginal young man who finds love in Taipei is charmingly cosmopolitan. Though it is rife with stereotypes, the movie's breeziness and bouyant good humor are difficult to resist. (Catsoulis)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out with Steve Carell in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Stephen Holden)    *'THE GOEBBELS EXPERIMENT' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English and German) Lutz Hachmeister and Michael Kloft's fascinating documentary provides a chilling glimpse into the brilliant but toxic mind of Joseph Goebbels via his extensive diaries. From soggy sentimentality to maniacal extermination fantasies, the entries reveal a supremely theatrical man whose manipulation of mass political opinion was unprecedented. (Catsoulis)    'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie, which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)    * 'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    * 'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is in many ways less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation, and how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    *'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)    '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)    *'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)    * 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    *'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) This is a relentless assault on the senses about three hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Kern)    'THE SKELETON KEY' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Kate Hudson in a T-shirt and underwear, intimations of unspeakable evil, slamming doors and equally slamming edits, and an introductory course in hoodoo, a folk religion born in the South -- all this and Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and John Hurt, too. (Dargis)    * 'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)    'SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE' (No rating, 121 minutes) In this exploitation flick from Park Chanwook about two men who each set a course for bloody vengeance, the violence carries no meaning beyond the director's ego. (Dargis)    *'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) In this delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, a lonely man awakens at 37 to life for the first time during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)    * '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'UNDISCOVERED' (PG-13, 97 minutes) A lifeless Los Angeles romance between an aspiring musician and a model is characterized by bland stars and overlong musical numbers. Set among a group of young people who dream of becoming famous, the picture carries more than a whiff of the self-referential. (Catsoulis)    'THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL' (No rating, 70 minutes) Keith A. Beauchamp's lean, harrowing documentary about the 50-year-old murder that catalyzed the civil rights movement offers new evidence that the crime was a broader conspiracy than originally thought. (Holden)    'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in the voice-overs. (Holden)    * 'WALL (MUR)' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) The filmmaker Simone Bitton takes a measured look at the barrier that divides Israel from the West Bank in this documentary, a film that considers hard-core political realities alongside agonizing personal truths. (Dargis)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NEW YORK (Through Wednesday, then an encore on Sept. 11) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater presents a weeklong run of Richard Karz's documentary about the second anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks.

Al Sharpton; Shirin Neshat, an Iranian-born artist and filmmaker; Dolly Lenz, a real estate broker; and Ti-Hua Chang, a local television news reporter. 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, (212)591-0434, $9. (Anita Gates)    REPERTORY NIGHTS (Through Nov. 6) The Museum of the Moving Image continues its annual film series with a Godard double feature. ''Breathless'' (1959), which defined nouvelle vague; and his first big-star feature, ''Contempt'' (1963), with Brigitte Bardot. Both films are to be shown on Saturday and Sunday. Other auteurs in the festival will include Ingmar Bergman, F.W. Murnau, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and François Truffaut. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077, $10. (Gates)    SUMMER SAMURAI (Through Sept. 15) Film Forum continues its four-week celebration of the Japanese warrior-action genre with Kihichi Okamoto's ''Kill!'' (1968), a genre blend (action, comedy and drama) about a samurai ordered to assassinate his best friend, and Masaki Kobayashi's ''Harakiri'' (1962), a drama about unemployed samurai in 17th-century peacetime. Other films in the festival include Akira Kurosawa's ''Seven Samurai'' (1964), ''Yojimbo'' (1961) and ''Throne of Blood'' (1957); and Okamoto's ''Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo'' (1970). 209 West Houston Street, (212)727-8110, $10. (Gates)    TRUTH AND DARE: NEW YORK KOREAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through Sept. 11) BAMcinématek's festival of recent films from Korea, now in its fifth year, begins today. This weekend's features include Chu Chang-Min's ''Mapado: All About the Hemp & Widows'' (2005), a comedy about a stolen Lotto jackpot and five lonely women, and Choi Dong-Hoon's bank heist film, ''The Big Swindle'' (2004).

MARC ANTHONY, ALEJANDRO FERNÁNDEZ (Tomorrow) Mr. Anthony is the biggest-selling salsa artist of all time, and is still passionately riding the rhythm as well as reportedly coaching his new wife, Jennifer Lopez, on the finer points of full-bodied singing. Mr. Fernández, the Mexican crooner, sings sweeping love ballads as well as mariachi standards. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $40 to $95. (Laura Sinagra)    ASYLUM STREET SPANKERS (Sunday) Jumpy, gypsified jazz of a Creole variety forms the repertory of this energetic Austin band, which slides easily from cabaret ragtime to hammy heartbreakers. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $15 in advance, $18.

(Grace Glueck)    *BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE CENTER FOR AMERICAN ART VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Roberta Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Holland Cotter)    *MET: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES,' through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. (See above.) (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair to good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    *NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    * NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: Uptown    'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among the nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook where he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)    IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    *'REPEAT PERFORMANCE'  More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'ANOTHER EXPO: BEYOND THE NATION STATE' An international group of eight politically minded conceptualists take on nationalism. The most striking work is Marina Abramovic's large, staged photograph of herself sitting in a mournful posture on a pile of bloody bones. White Box, 525 West 26th Street, (212)714-2347, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    *JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)    'ON VIEW: PHOTOGRAPHING THE MUSEUM' Among 20 well-selected ways of picturing the museum are Elliot Erwitt's view of a naked, sculptural Diana aiming her arrow at an unsuspecting live male visitor; wax figures by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Diane Arbus; a specimen drawer full of cardinals (birds, that is) by Terry Evans; and the dreamlike image of three real foxes in a formal period room by Karen Knorr. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    *BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20-inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ALONG THE WAY: M.T.A. ARTS FOR TRANSIT' This extensive survey of artworks commissioned over the last two decades by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is more that just a promotional event. Including paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures by dozens of well-known artists, it is a fascinating window onto an artscape usually only glimpsed by commuters in bits and pieces. UBS, 1285 Sixth Avenue, at 51st Street, (212)713-2885, through Sept. 9. (Johnson)    'ARTISTS AND PATRONS IN TRADITIONAL AFRICAN CULTURES: AFRICAN SCULPTURE FROM THE GARY SCHULZE COLLECTION'  Queensborough Community College has quietly assembled an impressive collection of African art. A year ago, the college inaugurated a permanent display of the collection in its campus gallery. And this summer the gallery is presenting a temporary exhibition of nearly 100 sculptures from a private collection. Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, the City University of New York, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, Queens, (718)631-6396, through Sept. 30. (Cotter)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10, by appointment. (Johnson)    'EXILE, NEW YORK IS A GOOD HOTEL' This new gallery, established by the German-based critic and curator Anke Kempkes, offers a spectacular view of the Empire State Building and a show of work by young artists from Berlin, Glasgow and Warsaw, along with a collaborative slide piece by the New Yorkers Ken Okiishi and Nick Mauss. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, near 28th Street, Apt. 1602, (212)481-0362, through Sept. 16, by appointment. (Cotter)    'A.B. NORMAL'  Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyper-realistic Zamboni made of rigid pale-green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    'PRECIOUS MOMENTS' Mall culture, with its peculiar poignancies, is the theme of ''Precious Moments,'' a smart, sad five-person show organized by the artist Josh Kline. Joymore, 236 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (646)270-0376, through Sept. 10. (Cotter)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION'  This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent, and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    'BODY AND OBJECTS' Depending on your mood, this three-person show might provoke thought or irritation. Most striking are Jiang Zhi's large photographs of two topless dancers, one a woman who has had a double mastectomy, the other a transsexual with breast implants. Tang Yi presents a series of photographs of a young woman blowing up colored balloons into a birdcage, and Chu Yun offers worn bars of soap as miniature sculptures formed by contact with his body. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)414-1169, closing today. (Johnson)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914' This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,'  closing on Sunday. Sifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Smith)    'DRUNK VS. STONED' This show eschews the usual aesthetic dualities for one that is less about style than lifestyle and proves that it is useful in sorting artworks and their effects. The 39 works assembled represent all mediums and several generations, from early explorers of altered states like Henri Michaux, R. Crumb and Bruce Conner to younger artists like Jason Fox, Huma Bhabha, Evan Holloway Adam McEwen and the Dearraindrop collective. Several touch directly on substance use and abuse in terms of its physiological or interpersonal impact or its social (read class) implications. Others are involved with what might be called the formal aspects of drunk (extroverted, emotional, robustly physical) as opposed to stoned (mesmerizing, becalmed, obsessively repetitious). In some pieces the twain meet. Others are unexpectedly pressed into service by one side or the other and cast in new light. For example, Charles Ray's 1996 short film, ''Fashions,'' comes across here as a masterpiece of stoner focus. ''Better Than Nauman,'' Mike Kelley's video installation, on view in the gallery's old space at Passerby, constitutes drunken subject matter in stoner form. Gavin Brown Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, Greenwich Village, and Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, Chelsea (212)627-5258, closing on Wednesday. (Smith)    *WILLIAM EGGLESTON: 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-7727, closing today. (Johnson)    'GIRLS ON FILM' More than 30 artists, from Francis Picabia and Mel Ramos to Lisa Yuskavage and John Currin, are featured in an entertaining exhibition about art inspired by popular erotica. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212)517-8677, closing today. (Johnson)    *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA' The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY' The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700, closing on Monday. (Glueck)    'SELF-PRESERVATION SOCIETY' A longtime holdout finally moves to Chelsea and opens a sleek space with a lively show of gallery regulars. Basketball fans must see Tom Sanford's comic-realist painting of last season's infamous brawl between the Pacers and the Pistons. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)334-9255, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    PETER WEGNER: 'LEVER LABYRINTH' Ever wonder what two and a half million sheets of paper would look like? Here they are in stacks of different shades of green. The paper stacks form a maze in the Lever House lobby that you can wander through as though following a path through a geometricized forest. Lever House, 390 Park Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)421-7927, closing on Sunday.

One of the Public Theater's early Broadway transfers, this 1971 musical adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy features lyrics by John Guare and music by Galt MacDermot. Kathleen Marshall directs (2:45). The Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater, Central Park, entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West, and at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)539-8750.    'DR. SEX' Previews begin today. Opens Sept 20. After getting the Liam Neeson treatment on the big screen, the life of the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey gets its own show tunes, courtesy of this new musical comedy (2:20). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    'FRAN'S BED' Previews begin Tuesday. Opens Sept. 25. The fall season's celebrity sightings begin as James Lapine directs Mia Farrow and Julia Stiles in his play about a woman undergoing a midlife crisis (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' Opens Sept. 15. A hit at the 2004 New York Musical Theater Festival, this comic musical features trailer trash singing show tunes (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.    'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' Previews begin Wednesday. Opens Sept. 19. Rolin Jones's high-concept sci-fi play, about a young genius who builds a better robot, helps kick off the 20th anniversary season of the Atlantic Theater Company (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.    'MIRACLE BROTHERS' Opens Sept. 18. A epic new musical by Kirsten Childs about the adventures of two brothers -- one black, one white -- in 17th-century Brazil (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.    'MOTHER COURAGE' Previews begin today. Opens Sept. 4. The Jean Cocteau Repertory Theater opens its 35th season with Marc Bliztstein's world-premiere translation of Brecht's play with music. David Fuller directs (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, East Village, (212)279-4200.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Mr. Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). The Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub. Directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the show feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt, despite the presence of a top-flight cast led by Nathan Lane. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint in Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful, funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE DEAR BOY' An uptight English teacher learns to cut loose, at least a bit, when he's confronted with an unflattering portrait written by a gifted but troubled student. Capably acted but lacking in real substance (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)246-4422, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    'DEAR DUBYA: PATRIOTIC LOVE LETTERS TO WHITEHOUSE.ORG' Peevish, pathetic and plain unhinged, the e-mail messages rendered reader's-theater-style in this brief, seldom cheap, often funny show demonstrate that President Bush has no shortage of credulous, humor-impaired fans and foes (45 minutes). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)907-6189, closing Sunday. (Rob Kendt)    'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Stevens)    'IVANOV' Jonathan Bank's staging of the Chekhov classic ''Ivanov'' with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of that of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231, closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb)    'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' The hand of fate reaches all the way into a steaming hot tub filled with cranky women in this seriocomic lesbian soap opera from the Five Lesbian Brothers. A richly funny Sapphic sex comedy, it is also a serious inquiry into the unforeseen extremities of despair that can attend the search for a lasting love (1:30). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)460-5475, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap with Natasha Richardson about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)    'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)    'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the early 1970's, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)    'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    'THE CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) ''The Century of the Self,'' a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Freud's seminal theory of the subconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Dana Stevens)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-top dog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH'  (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    * 'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. (Scott)    'DEUCE BIGALOW: EUROPEAN GIGOLO' (R, 77 minutes) In a sequel to the 1999 hit, the schlubby escort lands in Amsterdam to make lovelorn ladies feel whole, but the entire ordeal is mockery disguised as self-help. The insulting comedy is out of step with the culture, the times and the rebranded Adam Sandler, who was a producer and bit-player in this mess. (Ned Martel)    'THE DUKES OF HAZZARD' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Yee-haw? Naw. (Scott)    'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael Gonzalez (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be made floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela) is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out with Steve Carell in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Stephen Holden)    'THE GOEBBELS EXPERIMENT' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English and German) Lutz Hachmeister and Michael Kloft's fascinating documentary provides a chilling glimpse into the brilliant but toxic mind of Joseph Goebbels via his extensive diaries. Careening from soggy sentimentality to maniacal extermination fantasies, the entries reveal a supremely theatrical man whose manipulation of mass political opinion was unprecedented. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie, which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)    'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry. (Dargis)    'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)    'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is in many ways less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation, and how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)    '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)    'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    'REEL PARADISE' (R, 110 minutes) Steve James's untidy but absorbing documentary follows a family of New York cinéastes to Fiji, where they show free movies to the people, and experience mild culture clash and domestic disharmony. (Holden)    *'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) This is a relentless assault on the senses about three hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul ), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Laura Kern)    'THE SKELETON KEY' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Kate Hudson in a T-shirt and underwear, intimations of unspeakable evil, slamming doors and equally slamming edits and an introductory course in hoodoo, a folk religion born in the South -- all this and Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and John Hurt, too. (Dargis)    'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)    'SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE' (No rating, 121 minutes) In this exploitation flick from Park Chanwook about two men who each set a course for bloody vengeance, the violence carries no meaning beyond the director's ego. (Dargis)    'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) A delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, it is about a lonely man who at 37 awakens to life for the first time during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)    '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL' (No rating, 70 minutes) Keith A. Beauchamp's lean, harrowing documentary about the 50-year-old murder that catalyzed the civil rights movement offers new evidence that the crime was a broader conspiracy than originally thought. (Holden)    'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in this movie's cartoon voiceovers. (Holden)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    THE BEST OF NEWFEST 2005 (Through Sunday) BAM cinématek presents a weekend festival of nine feature films and three shorts programs from the recent 17th annual New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Film Festival.

(Through Tuesday) This summer festival, presented by Thalia Film Classics, honors great women in classic movies, this week with two intense femmes fatales. In ''Eve'' (1963), set in Venice, the great Jeanne Moreau plays a gold-digging seducer with her eye on a successful Welsh writer. Louise Brooks stars in ''Pandora's Box'' (1929), a silent film about a woman of ill repute involved with a doctor, his son and a lesbian countess. (Very pre-Code.) Both films play tomorrow and Tuesday. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-1414, $10. (Gates)    JAZZ MUSIC & FILM FESTIVAL (Through tomorrow) Makor concludes its series of films chosen by jazz musicians, who will perform live after the screenings of their favorites.

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    AMERICAN ANALOG SET (Tuesday) This Austin band plays wistful, conspiratorial whisper-pop that's more hum than drone. Playing in the cocoonlike Joe's Pub should make this stop on the band's farewell tour especially intimate. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $15. (Laura Sinagra)    KEYSHIA COLE (Wednesday) The Oakland-born R&B singer Keyshia Cole presents a tough-cookie brand of diva soul that focuses less on fashionista posing than righteous recrimination. On her single ''I Changed My Mind,'' she rides Kanye West's hard-clapping track with sultry grit. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20 in advance, $22. (Sinagra)    ALICE COOPER, CHEAP TRICK (Monday) School's been out forever, but the snake-toting father of glammy, hard-rock horror, Alice Cooper, still manages to growl out adolescent complaints like ''Eighteen'' and ''No More Mr. Nice Guy.'' Seminal 70's power-popper Cheap Trick, still in fine form, enjoys regular praise from younger bands both pop-punk and emo. 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $43.

Tonight with San Francisco's ooze-punk band Flipper, known for the hard-core sludge howler ''Sex Bomb.'' Tomorrow, with the dirty Anti-Nowhere League, the Nihilistics, and SFA, 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $35.

(Sinagra)    GREEN DAY (Thursday) Since the mid-90's, these pop-punkers have moved from couch-surfing anthems to smackdowns of exurban cluelessness. The trio's ''American Idiot'' (Reprise, 2004) rejected both a ''redneck agenda'' and sleepwalking worship of the ''Jesus of Suburbia.'' 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., Ticketmaster.com, $35. (Sinagra)    DARYL HALL & JOHN OATES, TODD RUNDGREN (Tonight and Tuesday) The Philadelphia platinum pop duo has always relied on the blue-eyed-soul crooner Daryl Hall's ability to emote within tight, rhythmic constraints while John Oates harmonizes urgently above. Mr. Hall has recently been fighting Lyme disease but is reportedly still in fine voice. The 70's pop powerhouse Todd Rundgren is a perfect addition to the bill. Tonight at 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $50.

(Sinagra)    COREY HARRIS, HUBERT SUMLIN (Sunday) Mr. Harris is a traditionalist fingerpicker who finds new insights in classic country blues. Playing lead guitar behind Howlin' Wolf for more than two decades, Mr. Sumlin defined the jagged, asymmetrical attack of classic Chicago blues guitar. His spiky aggression echoes through blues and rock. These two artists are highlights of a Sunday-afternoon blues and barbecue bill that includes Guitar Shorty and Candye Kane. Mr. Harris plays at 3:45 p.m., Mr. Sumlin at 7:45. Festival runs from 2 to 9 p.m., Hudson River Park, Pier 54, (212)627-2020, free.

(Sinagra)    ICE-T, KOOL KEITH & THE ULTRAMAGNETIC MC'S (Tuesday) The Los Angeles rapper Ice-T's styles have run the gamut from dance-floor pimping to the rap-metal squall of his band Body Count. The shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith's Ultramagnetic MC's were a critical hit in rap's late-80's golden age, helping to nudge old school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. Solo, he created personae like Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom, though his intricate, zany, rhymes have grown less rewarding over time. Ice-T and Kool Keith have recorded together in the past as the Analog Brothers. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $18 to $20.

(Sinagra)    JOURNEY (Tonight and Sunday) Despite the absence of Steve Perry's soaring vocals, the 80's pop band responsible for anthemic keyboard-driven schmaltz like ''Don't Stop Believin''' and ''Faithfully'' soldiers on for crowds singing along way too loud to notice. Tonight at 8, PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $63. Sunday at 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $65.

(Sinagra)    AVRIL LAVIGNE, GAVIN DEGRAW (Tomorrow) The pop skater-girl Avril Lavigne is keeping her surf cred by hanging tight with Sum 41's singer, Deryck Whibley. But she's maturing into a tough-minded careerist, teaming up here with an opening act sure not to overshadow her, the likable pianist Gavin DeGraw. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $46. (Sinagra)    TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS, I AM KLOOT (Tomorrow) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and falsetto also recall the 70's arena rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. The Manchester indie-poppers I Am Kloot open. 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17 (Fulton Street), Lower Manhattan, (212)219-3910, free. (Sinagra)    LOUIS XIV, THE IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Thursday) The lads in the exaggerated glam outfit Louis XIV are sloppier and rockier than the Darkness and significantly less sincere. To paraphrase their hero T-Rex, they think they're champs, but they're not. The Minnesota bar rocker Ike Reilly is more clever and slightly less suspect. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $15. (Sinagra)    THE NEVILLE BROTHERS (Tonight) The Neville Brothers have been at the center of New Orleans funk since the 1950's, and apply all their experience in syncopation to their own songs and, lately, cover songs like ''Ball of Confusion.'' 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, $33 in advance, $35. (Pareles)    RAINER MARIA (Monday) This Midwestern emo band's best asset is the bassist Caithlin De Marrais, who screams eloquent diary entries over pointy, distorted guitar pop. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $10.

It gained some fame a few years back when its hard-partying singer dated Kelly Osbourne. 5:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212)485-1534, $30. (Sinagra)    CARLOS VIVES, DADDY YANKEE (Tomorrow) The Colombian singer-songwriter Carlos Vives made his name weaving Bogotá balladry, Andean traditional music and accordion-heavy coastal vallenato into rock and pop.

(Kozinn)    MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA (Tonight and tomorrow) The Russian composer Dmitry Stepanovich Bortnyansky, born five years before Mozart, was a Mozart devotee who presented Mozart's Requiem and other Mozart works at the Russian imperial court. In his own music he emulated Mozartean qualities of clarity and elegance. The connection between the two composers, however thematically tenuous, was enough to prompt Louis Langrée, the music director of the Mostly Mozart Festival, to pair Bortnyansky's little-known ''Te Deum'' on tonight's program with Mozart's Mass in C minor for the final weekend of the festival. The singers of the Russian Patriarchate Choir, an all-male ensemble that specializes in Russian liturgical chant and 19th-century Russian choral works, will perform, along with the Concert Chorale of New York and a roster of strong vocal soloists. Tomorrow night the festival concludes with a far more traditional all-Mozart program. The Mass in C minor will be repeated, this time preceded by the Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, with the pianist Jonathan Biss as soloist. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $32 to $52.

(Midgette)    SKANEATELES FESTIVAL (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Since most other festivals are beginning to fold their tents, it may be time to dig out the map and do some exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, N.Y., near Syracuse, this event presents an attractive chamber concert tonight and a concert by the Festival Chamber Orchestra, including wonderful wind serenades by Mozart and Dvorak, tomorrow. The excellent violinist Hilary Hahn appears in a free children's concert on Wednesday morning at 11 and in another chamber concert on Thursday. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 8; tonight and Wednesday at First Presbyterian Church, 97 East Genesee Street; tomorrow at Brook Farm, south on Route 41A; Thursday at Skaneateles High School, 49 East Elizabeth Street, (315)685-7418; tonight and Thursday, $16 and $21, $13 and $18 for students and 65+; tomorrow, $18 and $24. (James R. Oestreich)    TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) The Polish conductor Marek Janowski comes to the Berkshires to conclude the Boston Symphony Orchestra's Tanglewood season. He'll have help tonight from Lynn Harrell, who will be the soloist in Haydn's Cello Concerto No. 2 on a program that also includes Beethoven's Second Symphony and Mozart's Serenade No. 6 (K. 239). On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Janowski leads Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Tanglewood Festival Chorus joined by Hillevi Martinpelto, soprano; Susan Platts, mezzo-soprano; Kurt Streit, tenor; and Alastair Miles, bass-baritone. But the weekend is not all somber goodbyes. Tomorrow night, John Williams leads the Boston Pops, along with Josh Groban, in ''Film Night at Tanglewood.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200, $17 (lawn) to $96. (Eichler)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    HOWL FESTIVAL 2005: YOSHIKO CHUMA & THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS (Tonight through Sunday) In her new ''Inside/Outside,'' this madcap modern-dance choreographer creates a world of stage space and cubes, with black-and-white film projected on them. The program also includes ''8 Brand New Short Dances,'' a suite of pieces created by newish downtown choreographers and shown two per show. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 5 p.m. P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue at Ninth Street, East Village; (212)477-5288 or www.ps122.org, $15. (Jennifer Dunning)    JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) This is the last weekend of this charming and important Berkshires dancefest. Tonight through Sunday, Black Grace from New Zealand, a big hit last summer, will be at the larger Ted Shawn Theater, and Project Fukurow, offering mysterious weirdness from Tokyo, will be at the Doris Duke Studio Theater. Black Grace, tonight and tomorrow night at 8, and Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m.; $45; $40.50 for students, 65+ and children. Fukurow, tonight and tomorrow night at 8:15, Saturday at 2:15 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m.; $20; $18 for students, seniors and children. Details of free performances and exhibitions can be found at www.jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413)243-0745. (John Rockwell)    LINCOLN CENTER OUT OF DOORS FESTIVAL (Monday through Thursday) Jamel Gaines and his Creative Outlet Dance Theater of Brooklyn will tear up the plaza at 6 p.m. today, followed by the José Limón Dance Company tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the Damrosch Park Band Shell, in a program that includes Limón's ''Moor's Pavane'' and ''Chaconne,'' and dances by Jiri Kylian, Lar Lubovitch and Donald McKayle.

(212)875-5766 and www.lincolncenter.org. (Dunning)    NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL FRINGE FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) In the closing week of this sprawling, provocative festival of new art, there will be dance performances by Anandam of ''Frida and Herself,'' a piece by Brandy Leary and Prashant Gupta that is drawn from the life and work of Frida Kahlo (today at 3:15 p.m.; tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; and Sunday at noon). The Tickly Cheeks Group will present ''Rock Out.'' Created by Gregory Jones and Tiffany Hodges, ''Rock Out'' tells the story of two shy types whose inner selves are released by dancing (tonight at 11; tomorrow at 1 p.m. and Sunday at 1:45 p.m.) All performances are at the Linhart Theater, 440 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)279-4488; (888)374-6436 (outside New York) and www.fringenyc.org, $15. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,'  through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent, and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,'  through Sept. 4. Sifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES,' through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair to good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to an organization called Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    THE NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or his weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Oct. 9. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 31. Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: Uptown    'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook where he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)    IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    'REPEAT PERFORMANCE'  More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'BODY AND OBJECTS' Depending on your mood, this three-person show might provoke thought or irritation. Most striking are Jiang Zhi's large photographs of two topless dancers, one a woman who has had a double mastectomy, the other a transsexual with breast implants. Tang Yi presents a series of photographs of a young woman blowing up colored balloons into a birdcage, and Chu Yun offers worn bars of soap as miniature sculptures formed by contact with his body. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)414-1169, through Sept. 2. (Johnson)    WILLIAM EGGLESTON 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Sept. 2 (Johnson)    JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)    'ON VIEW: PHOTOGRAPHING THE MUSEUM' Among 20 well-selected ways of picturing the museum are Elliot Erwitt's view of a naked, sculptural Diana aiming her arrow at an unsuspecting live male visitor; wax figures by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Diane Arbus; a specimen drawer full of cardinals (birds, that is) by Terry Evans; and the dreamlike image of three real foxes in a formal period room by Karen Knorr. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20- inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)    'SELF-PRESERVATION SOCIETY' A longtime holdout finally moves to Chelsea and opens a sleek space with a lively show of gallery regulars. Basketball fans must see Tom Sanford's comic-realist painting of last season's infamous brawl between the Pacers and the Pistons. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, (212)334-9255, through Sept. 3. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures depicted naturalistically, real animals portrayed surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)    'EXILE, NEW YORK IS A GOOD HOTEL,'  This new gallery, established by the German-based critic and curator Anke Kempkes, offers a spectacular view of the Empire State Building and an international introductory show of work by young artists from Berlin, Glasgow and Warsaw, along with a collaborative slide piece by the New Yorkers Ken Okiishi and Nick Mauss. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, near 28th Street, Apt. 1602, (212)481-0362, through Sept. 17. (Cotter)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10, by appointment. (Johnson)    'ARTISTS AND PATRONS IN TRADITIONAL AFRICAN CULTURES: AFRICAN SCULPTURE FROM THE GARY SCHULZE COLLECTION'  Queensborough Community College has quietly assembled an impressive collection of African art. A year ago, the college inaugurated a permanent display of the collection in its campus gallery. And this summer the gallery is presenting a temporary exhibition of nearly 100 sculptures from a private collection. Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, the City University of New York, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, Queens, (718)631-6396. through Sept. 30. (Cotter)    'A.B. NORMAL'  Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyper-realistic Zamboni made of rigid pale-green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    'PRECIOUS MOMENTS' Mall culture, with its peculiar poignancies, is the theme of ''Precious Moments,'' a smart, sad five-person show organized by the artist Josh Kline. Joymore, 236 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (646)270-0376, through Sept. 10. (Cotter)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft-drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, closing Sunday. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS' This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    LIU ZHENG: 'THE CHINESE' Under the influence of Sander, Frank and Arbus, this Chinese photographer set out to document his society with a focus on the dark and wild side. His pictures of miners, prisoners, strippers, transsexuals, hospital patients and corpses have an almost surrealistic intensity. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)414-0370, closing today. (Johnson)    'MASTERS OF CONTEMPORARY SCULPTURE' If you disregard the ugly and pretentious installation piece by the dean of Arte Povera, Mario Merz, then 50 glass snowballs by Not Vital, a circle of granite chunks by Richard Long, a sculptureof stairs painted in Burmese red lacquer by Wolfgang Laib, a life-size simulation of an airplane lavatory by Tom Sachs and a 51-minute piece of Bruce Nauman's nocturnal video of his studio all add up to an almost perfectly satisfying show. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, (212)999-7337, closing on Wednesday. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400, closing Monday. (Kimmelman)    'REMARKABLE HANDS' Three Japanese make art by hand: Yayoi Deki creates gently psychedelic floral patterns with a finely pointed brush; Yoko Kawamoto paints small, photo-based pictures of junked cars and industrial sites with a dry but sensuous touch; and Tomoo Gokita, using chameleonlike skill and mischievous humor, draws many different kinds of pop-culture imagery. ATM, 511 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)375-0349, closing today.

It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'  (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schreiber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). The Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE DEAR BOY' An uptight English teacher learns to cut loose, at least a bit, when he's confronted with an unflattering portrait written by a gifted but troubled student. Capably acted, but lacking in real substance (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'IVANOV' Jonathan Bank's staging of the Chekhov classic ''Ivanov'' with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of that of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jonathan Kalb)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Stevens)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' The hand of fate reaches all the way into a steaming hot tub filled with cranky women in this seriocomic lesbian soap opera from the Five Lesbian Brothers. A richly funny Sapphic sex comedy, it is also a serious inquiry into the unforeseen extremities of despair that can attend the search for a lasting love (1:30). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)460-5475. (Isherwood)    'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them, and on the catchy music. Unfortunately the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters despite the actors' best attempts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint in Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful and funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful emotional crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'DEAR DUBYA: PATRIOTIC LOVE LETTERS TO WHITEHOUSE.ORG' Peevish, pathetic and plain unhinged, the e-mail messages rendered reader's-theater-style in this brief, seldom cheap, often funny show demonstrate that President Bush has no shortage of credulous, humor-impaired fans and foes (45 minutes). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 907-6189. (Rob Kendt)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BROTHER' Nothing is quite what it seems at first in ''Brother,'' Lisa Ebersole's confrontational one-act play about a pair of sisters who taunt each other, and a black man who suddenly joins them in the middle of the night in an East Village apartment. The audience is uncomfortably close to the action in this theater-in-the-round production, which starts with an ambiguous tension that quickly escalates (55 minutes). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger)    'THE PERSIANS' Though he fought with the victorious Greeks, Aeschylus wrote the tragedy of ''The Persians'' entirely from the perspective of the vanquished. This imaginative musical production by a young company called Waterwell extends that act of empathy, while also managing to be wildly funny and entertaining (1:15). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Miriam Horn)    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Manohla Dargis)    'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the early 1970's, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)    'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers -- including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange -- and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)    'CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) ''The Century of the Self,'' a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Sigmund Freud's seminal theory of the subconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Dana Stevens)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'THE CONFORMIST' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Italian) Bertolucci's 1970's look at the soul man under Fascism returns to take us back not only to the Mussolini years, but also, more dramatically, to the time of its own making, a cinematic era of stylistic daring and aesthetic bravura. (Scott)    'CRASH'  (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis)    'THE DUKES OF HAZZARD' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Yeee-haw? Naw. (Scott)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)    'THE GOEBBELS EXPERIMENT' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English and German) Lutz Hachmeister and Michael Kloft's fascinating documentary provides a chilling glimpse inside the brilliant but toxic mind of Joseph Goebbels via his extensive diaries. Careening from soggy sentimentality to maniacal extermination fantasies, the entries reveal a supremely theatrical man whose manipulation of mass political opinion was unprecedented. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)    'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)     'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)     'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)      'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation, and how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up, but refuses to address. (Holden)    'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)    *'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)    'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring. (Scott)    'SAINT RALPH' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This story of a 14-year-old Canadian schoolboy in the early 1950's who believes in miracles is pure treacle. (Holden)    'SARABAND' (R, 107 minutes, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden)    *'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) ''Secuestro Express'' is a relentless assault on the senses about a trio of hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul Leroux), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money's arrival. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Laura Kern)     'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question, ''Is there life after high school?,'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)    'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'STEALTH' (PG-13, 117 minutes) A preposterous hash of ''Top Gun'' and ''Behind Enemy Lines,'' topped with a soupçon of ''2001,'' this crypto-video game about three stealth pilots has the makings of a kitsch classic; too bad it's not remotely funny. (Dargis)    'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) A delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, this film is about a lonely man who at 37 awakens to life for the first time during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)     '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    ' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    BORN IN BROOKLYN: ROSIE PEREZ (Wednesday and Thursday) BAMcinématek is sponsoring a two-day salute to Ms. Perez in her home borough.

AKRON/FAMILY, DAVID GRUBBS, WOODEN WAND AND THE VANISHING VOICE (Tomorrow) The East River Music Project's final summer show features Akron/Family, a quartet that explores the crannies and latent explosiveness of Americana. The experimental guitarist David Grubbs is in a jazz-folk mood as of late. Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice warp various genres. 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, Lower East Side, free. (Laura Sinagra)    ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND (Tuesday) The archetypal Southern rock band is still on the road. Gregg Allman, the band's keyboardist and main singer, is more than ever the band's center, since its co-founder Dickey Betts is estranged from the band. His replacement, Warren Haynes, shares the twin-guitar passages with Derek Trucks, the drummer Butch Trucks's nephew and a jam-band leader in his own right. 6:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $65. (Sinagra)    TORI AMOS (Tonight) This piano-grinding sensualist spent the 1990's rendering stormy emotional experience via alt-rock drama. Her songs were pounded out on a well-worn Bösendorfer piano and sung in a shamanic, childlike voice. Lately, she's been seeking strong female archetypes in biblical lore and reflecting on the nuances of married sexuality. 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $50. (Sinagra)    AMSTERJAM: RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, SNOOP DOGG, 311, GARBAGE, FAT JOE, WYCLEF JEAN (Tomorrow) This random collection of faded alt-rockers and tenaciously popular rap acts includes the resurging Snoop Dogg, who does his stoner-for-all-seasons rap thing, and Fat Joe (aka Joey Crack), whose rump-shaking hit ''Get it Poppin'' is tasty New York radio candy. The funk-punk Chili Peppers, the enduring vixen Shirley Manson's Garbage, and slick ska-metal 311 forge on with alt-rock willfulness. The outspoken Caribbean folk-rapper Wyclef Jean will probably opine on Haiti's ongoing crises. 11 a.m., Randalls Island Golf Center, 1 Randalls Island, (212)427-5689, $45. (Sinagra)    APSCI (Monday) This Brooklyn-based husband-and-wife duo, whose band name is short for ''applied science,'' serves up beats that slide from synth-electro to glitch electronica. Raphael LaMotta raps with blasé indie savvy while Dana Diaz-Tutaan adds jazzy filigree. 8 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)420-1466, $7. (Sinagra)    JOAN ARMATRADING (Thursday) With her deep, longing voice and songs about love and affection, Joan Armatrading was a beacon for songwriters in the 1970's and 1980's. Raul Midón opens. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 749-5838, $39 to $49. (Jon Pareles)    DICKEY BETTS & GREAT SOUTHERN (Tonight) Kicked out of a band that he founded, the Allman Brothers, the guitarist Dickey Betts wasted no time in going back on tour with his own group. His chiming, symmetrical guitar solos and the weary but amiable voice from songs like ''Blue Skies'' are intact, and he may even have something to prove. 8 and 10 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $35. (Pareles)    ERIC BURDON AND THE ANIMALS (Sunday) Eric Burdon translated American soul into British Invasion rock as the belter who led the Animals; then he came to the source, joining forces with an up-and-coming American band, War. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $27, $30 at the door. (Pareles)    EDMAR CASTANEDA (Tonight) The Colombian harp was not often heard in a jazz context until the teenage prodigy Edmar Castaneda began nudging its limits in the mid-90's. 8 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $15. (Sinagra)    RODNEY CROWELL (Tuesday) He has written songs for Emmylou Harris, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, the Oak Ridge Boys, Bob Seger, Tim McGraw, Lee Ann Womack and his ex-wife, Rosanne Cash. His own recent work tends toward raw, straightforward rockabilly. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $20. (Sinagra)    NEIL DIAMOND (Tonight and tomorrow) After four decades, during which his folk-rock evolved into high-gloss Vegas pop, this singer-songwriter has recently been working with the rock-and-rap producer Rick Rubin, who famously helped Johnny Cash garner an alt-rock audience in the 90's. Spare new songs reportedly rely on acoustic guitar and aim for a lonesome vibe. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212) 465-6741, $70 to $100. (Sinagra)    THE DOUBLE (Wednesday) Like the Fiery Furnaces, this Brooklyn band ornaments its songs with kaleidoscopic experimentation. Former math-rockers, they've seemingly gone through a Brian Wilson phase, and now use all the tools at their lo-fi disposal in service of arty pop undercut with burbles, dark surges and twinges. 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Lower Manhattan, free. (Sinagra)    50 CENT, LUDACRIS, LIL JON, MIKE JONES, CIARA (Tonight and tomorrow) Soon to have his life story captured on film, the multi-platinum rapper 50 Cent is joined here by the Southern rappers Ludacris and Lil Jon. Mike Jones gives cough-syrup haze an enticing menace, while Ciara rides molasses beats smoothly enough. Tonight at 7, Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $30 to $61. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $30 to $61. (Sinagra)    JULIANA HATFIELD (Tonight) Ms. Hatfield's voice, that of a weary but urgent ingénue, added charm to the music of the Blake Babies in the 80's and her own solo projects in the 90's. This singer-songwriter's mainstream profile dimmed, but she continues to release albums with a low-key, confessional spark. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505, $16 in advance, $18. (Sinagra)    HOCKEY NIGHT (Tonight and tomorrow) This hard-riffing band from St. Paul plays jaunty noise pop with a fierce beat, courtesy of its two drummers. The singer Paul Sprangers has a dry delivery reminiscent of Pavement's Stephen Malkmus. Tonight at 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, at Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, free. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)    CHRIS ISAAK (Tomorrow) Chris Isaak is a disciple of Roy Orbison, writing dolorous ballads that find their only consolation in his honeyed voice and finely turned guitar lines. On stage, he's a droll storyteller. 8 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $47. (Pareles)    ISLAJA, LAU NAU, KUUPUU, PEKKO KÃPPI (Thursday) Representing a panoply of sounds from the band-hopping musicians who make up the Finnish psychedelic-folk scene, this bill promises ethereal spookiness from the icy Islaja, accomplished jouhikko fiddle from Pekko Käppi, a weave of vocal textures and acoustic drone from Kuupuu and more vocal experimentation from Lau Nau. 8 p.m., Tommy's Tavern, 1041 Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)383-9699, $5. (Sinagra)    I-WAYNE (Tuesday) Last year, the 25-year-old Jamaican singer Clifford Taylor's jumpy ''Can't Satisfy Her,'' a smooth though insulting lament about a woman who won't retire from hooking, was one of the few roots-reggae songs spinning on Hot 97. In a high voice reminiscent of 60's pop crooners, Mr. Taylor (known as I-Wayne) avoids revolution slogans, calling instead for a kind of pastoral movement. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $15. (Sinagra)    SLEEPY LABEEF (Sunday) Sleepy LaBeef is an unregenerate rockabilly singer and guitarist from Arkansas. He reels off one twangy tune after another, known and obscure, like a rockabilly jukebox come to life. 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, (212)683-6500, free. (Pareles)    LEZ ZEPPELIN (Tomorrow) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy. Of course, they also have their gender-bending way with macho metaphors about squeezed lemons and dripping honey. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $17 in advance, $20. (Sinagra)    LIVING COLOUR (Tonight) The virtuoso guitarist and Black Rock Coalition co-founder Vernon Reid's most famous band's intelligent and at times groovy heavy metal took the group well beyond the small bar scene in the late-80's. They return to play snug CBGB's in this legendary dive's hour of need. 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, East Village, (212)982-4052, $35. (Sinagra)    MAGNOLIA ELECTRIC CO. (Tonight) The songwriter Jason Molina is a pessimist, and the music on his latest album of melancholy but gritty Chicago country-rock, ''What Comes After the Blues'' (Secretly Canadian), resembles that of a defeatist Neil Young. 11:30 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $10 in advance, $12.(Sinagra)    JESSE MALIN (Thursday) Jesse Malin led D Generation, the glam-rock kings of St. Mark's Place, and has gone on to a solo career that's considerably more earnest. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Pareles)    MEGADETH, DREAM THEATER (Tuesday) The Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine appeared recently in Metallica's ''Some Kind of Monster'' documentary, confessing lingering pain at his 1983 ejection from that band. His own precision thrash outfit was successful through the 90's despite grunge competition. An injury has silenced his speedy licks, but bandmates fill in on this tour with the metal technicians Dream Theater. 5 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $45. (Sinagra)    PALOMAR (Thursday) This local indie-pop quartet plays winsome songs that harken back to the 90's heyday of female-fronted guitar bands whose modest ambitions made them all the more likeable. With the Mosquitos. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $12. (Sinagra)    AMY RIGBY (Tuesday) This singer-songwriter sings about romance and decline with biting wit. She gave Nashville a try, but she's back home in New York, where her brand of real-life feistiness has always found a better fit. 9 p.m., Lakeside Lounge, 162 Avenue B, Lower East Side, (212)529-8463, free. (Sinagra)    THE RUB (Tomorrow) Continuing its hip mix of favela funk, reggaeton, dancehall, alt-rock, hip-hop, classic rock and pretty much anything else these sound-crazed smart-aleck D.J.'s can think of, this Brooklyn party celebrates its third anniversary. The point is to get the crowd chuckling and dancing at once. And it works. 11 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236, $8. (Sinagra)    CHARLIE SEXTON (Tonight and Monday) This guitar prodigy made his first record at the age of 16, when he was hailed as a sort of new-wave roots rocker. Since then he's played with Bob Dylan and produced for Lucinda Williams, and this year prepares to tour with John Mayer. His own songs increasingly tend toward personal alt-country. Tonight at 7:30, Housing Works Used Book Cafe, 126 Crosby Street, SoHo, (212)334-3324, $25. Monday at 7 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)    SYSTEM OF A DOWN (Tuesday) Combining crushing heaviness with extreme-sports dexterity allows this Armenian-American band to smuggle blatant antiwar messages past some of its more mainstream fans. 7 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900, $33 to $45. (Sinagra)    THE VANDALS (Tomorrow) Founded in 1980, this jokey punk-pop band, from Orange County, California, contributed to the bratty sound of younger bands like the Offspring and Blink-182. Tomorrow they play a benefit for CBGB. 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $25. (Sinagra)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Chinen)    ERIC McPHERSON AND NASHEET WAITS (Tomorrow) Two of jazz's most engagingly expressive younger drummers, united by a common gift for slippery propulsion, join the saxophonist Abraham Burton in an experimental exchange. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    MULGREW MILLER (Through Sunday) In celebration of his 50th birthday, the pianist Mulgrew Miller has been performing this week in various settings; tonight and tomorrow he augments his trio with the saxophonist Joe Lovano and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, and on Sunday he leads Wingspan, an airy yet propulsive sextet. 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $30, tonight and tomorrow, $25, Sunday. (Chinen)    GREG OSBY QUARTET (Tuesday through next Sunday) Mr. Osby is an alto saxophonist with a predilection for jagged edges, and yet he's squarely within the jazz tradition; his rhythm section consists of the pianist James Gordon Williams, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Tommy Crane. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    CHRIS POTTER'S UNDERGROUND (Tonight) The saxophonist Chris Potter has an improvisational approach that's intellectual and athletic in equal measure; here he dives headlong into edgy fusion, along with Wayne Krantz on guitar, Craig Taborn on Fender Rhodes and Nate Smith on drums. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)    KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Rosenwinkel's electric guitar has a beguilingly airy tone that offsets the cerebral twinge of his compositions; his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. These two are backed by a crack rhythm section: Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Ari Hoenig on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum (students half-price). (Chinen)    JENNY SCHEINMAN TRIO (Sunday and Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre; she performs on Sunday with the bassist Todd Sickafoose and the drummer Mark Ferber, and then on Tuesday in an improvising string trio with the violinist Carla Kihlstedt and the cellist Marika Hughes. Sunday at 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883; cover, $8. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177; suggested donation, $8. (Chinen)    TIERNEY SUTTON (Wednesday through next Saturday) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer; her fine new album, ''I'm With the Band'' (Telarc), was recorded at Birdland this spring, which makes this a return engagement. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    HENRY THREADGILL'S 3+3 (Sunday) Mr. Threadgill, the multi-reedist and composer, has been a restless avatar of creative music since the 1970's; here he offers the premiere of a work characteristically obsessed with texture and scored for reeds, three cellos, tuba and drums. 8 p.m., Museum of Modern Art, 14 West 54th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, (212)708-9491. Admission is free, but tickets are required, and will be distributed at 5:30 p.m. on a first-come, first-served basis. (Chinen)    JAMES (BLOOD) ULMER (Monday) As on the recent album ''Birthright'' (Hyena), Mr. Ulmer delivers a startlingly personal take on the blues, armed only with his warbling baritone and his apocalyptically groovy electric guitar. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    CEDAR WALTON QUINTET (Through Sunday) As a pianist and composer, Mr. Walton heeds an articulate, almost courtly variety of hard-bop; he's at his best when his forms spark solos from collaborators like the saxophonist Vincent Herring. 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 p.m. set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212)258-9595; cover: $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.(Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'AFTERNOON ARIAS' (Today) A new summer series of free concerts features opera arias, with piano, performed by singers from the New York City Opera in the somewhat bucolic if not acoustically ideal surroundings of Bryant Park. Today's program consists of excerpts from ''La Bohème'' and ''Don Giovanni,'' with house singers including Inna Dukach, Georgia Jarman and Michael Corvino. 12:30 p.m., Bryant Park, Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street, (212)870-7787. (Anne Midgette)    GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Tuesday) Is it a leading opera company or an experimental theater, a proving ground for young artists or a showcase for stars? Glimmerglass aspires to be all these things with a summer season -- now in its final week -- that ranges from an austere production of Benjamin Britten's valedictory ''Death in Venice'' to ''Lucie de Lammermoor,'' a French-language version of Donizetti's classic that verges, inadvertently, on comic relief. But through ups and downs there's a lot to like: take the American tenor William Burden, incandescent in the Britten as the writer Gustav von Aschenbach. Also on the summer program are Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte'' and an unusual double bill consisting of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's one-acter ''La Voix Humaine,'' which depicts a woman on the phone. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m. (''Venice''); tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Monday at 2 p.m. (''Così''); tomorrow night at 8 (''Portrait''/''Voix''); Tuesday at 2 p.m. (''Lucie''), Alice Busch Opera Theater, Route 80, eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607)547-2255, some tickets available tonight and tomorrow night for $31.50 to $55, otherwise sold out. (Midgette)    Classical Music    BARD MUSIC FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) This festival chooses a single composer each year and places that artist in a rich cultural context through concerts, lectures and panel discussions. This summer's theme is ''Copland and His World,'' and the second weekend of programming begins today (at 10 a.m.) with a series of documentaries as well as a symposium titled ''Mid-20th-Century American Culture and Politics.'' Tonight's concert (at 8) is called ''South of the Border,'' and features music by Copland, Nancarrow, Revueltas, Ginastera and others. Programming continues through late Sunday afternoon, when Leon Botstein will lead the American Symphony Orchestra (at 5 p.m.) in ''The Triumph of the American Symphonic Tradition,'' with more Copland as well as music by Roger Sessions, Walter Piston, Roy Harris and others. Details at www.bard.edu/bmf. Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900; $25 to $55, with discounts for students and 65+. (Jeremy Eichler)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. The range of music is typically broad: tonight, an ensemble that includes Rupert Boyd, a guitarist; Hector Del Curto, a bandoneon player; and Katya Mihailova, a pianist, play an eclectic program of works by Tchaikovsky, Mozart and Piazzolla. Tomorrow and Sunday, Alexander Fiterstein, a clarinetist, will take the spotlight for the Mozart and Weber clarinet quintets, and on Thursday, the pianist Jeffrey Swann performs and discusses works and transcriptions by Liszt. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083, $35; $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday; $40 tomorrow and Sunday. (Allan Kozinn)    BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and tomorrow) The festival's 22nd season comes to a close this weekend with two blockbuster works that don't often share the same program: Schubert's Cello Quintet and Mendelssohn's Octet. With veteran performers drawn from ensembles like the Tokyo and Orion Quartets as well as the Eroica Trio, one can hope for some major summer fireworks. Tonight at 7:30, St. Andrew's Dune Church, Southampton, N.Y.; tomorrow at 6:30 p.m., Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church, Bridgehampton, N.Y., (631)537-6368, $35; $30 for 65+. (Eichler)    MAVERICK CONCERTS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This concert series near Woodstock, N.Y., in its 90th season, offers its performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. Tomorrow afternoon the pianist Steven Lubin plays a program of Romantic music -- Sonatas by Beethoven (the ''Moonlight''), Schumann and Schubert, along with Chopin's B flat minor Scherzo. On Sunday, the Borromeo String Quartet plays works by Grieg, Fauré and Brahms, with the pianist Pedja Muzijevic. Tomorrow night at 6, Sunday at 3 p.m., Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845)679-8217, $20, $5 for students. (Kozinn)    MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL (Tonight through Thursday) Since becoming music director of the Minnesota Orchestra in 2003, the dynamic Finnish conductor Osmo Vanska has been a remarkable success. Minnesotans seem to love him. Mr. Vanska comes to New York this weekend to conduct two performances with the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra. The fine pianist Stephen Hough will be the soloist in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 in A. But it's Schubert's daunting Symphony No. 9 in C (''Great'') that should really be a showcase for Mr. Vanska's talents. On Tuesday and Wednesday nights Thomas Dausgaard takes over the podium for a program that includes Beethoven's ''Pastorale'' Symphony and Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 4 in D. The soloist in the concerto, the brilliant violinist Gil Shaham, will also appear with his sister, the pianist Orli Shaham, in an hourlong all-Mozart program at the intimate Kaplan Penthouse after Wednesday's orchestra concert. This late-night series, ''A Little Night Music,'' has proved popular. And why not? You sit at round tables with a free glass of wine and enjoy the music while taking in city views. Thursday night brings the United States debut of the Russian Patriarchate Choir, an all-male ensemble specializing in Russian liturgical chant and 19th-century repertory. Russian sacred music at the Mostly Mozart Festival? How this fits into the festival's theme of traveling with Mozart is unclear. ''Mozart in Russia'' doesn't do. Still, the featured composer on the program, Dmitry Stepanovich Bortnyansky, born five years before Mozart, presented works like Mozart's Requiem at the Russian imperial court and his music has Mozartean qualities. O.K., it's a stretch. But the concert should be fascinating. Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall (festival orchestra); Wednesday at 10:30 p.m., Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, 10th floor (''A Little Night Music''); Thursday at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall (Russian Patriarchate Choir), (212)721-6500, $32 to $52; $30 for ''A Little Night Music.'' (Anthony Tommasini)    MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Offering a smattering of choral music and jazz, but focusing on string quartets, this venerable festival presents the Arianna Quartet this weekend in a program of Mozart, Beethoven and the Dvorak Piano Quintet, for which they're joined by the pianist Anton Nel. Also on offer this weekend is a jazz ensemble called Big Easy Rhythm, specializing in early jazz. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 3, Gordon Hall at Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860)824-7126, $25; $12 for students under 24. (Midgette)    NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) Each summer the Yale Summer School of Music retreats north to this lovely spot, and the public reaps much of the benefit at concerts in the rustic Music Shed. But tomorrow the season ends, with a departure from the usual classical fare: a program by the fiddler Mark O'Connor's Appalachia Waltz Trio. 8 p.m., Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860)542-3000, $15 to $45; ages 18 to 25, $10; under 18, free with a paying adult. (James R. Oestreich)    'SERIAL UNDERGROUND' (Tonight through Sunday) The Composers Collaborative concludes its six-day festival of new music and theater. Tonight features music by Gerald Busby and Bob Windbiel. Tomorrow, Ed Schmidt and Jed Distler present ''The Gold Standard,'' described as a theater work about ''one helluva disgruntled piano player.'' Sunday's closing program includes a performance of Terry Riley's early Minimalist landmark, ''In C.'' 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212)663-1967, $20. (Eichler)    SKANEATELES FESTIVAL (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Since most other festivals are beginning to fold their tents, it may be time to dig out the map and do some exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, N.Y., near Syracuse, this event plays host to the Turtle Island String Quartet tonight and, in combination with the Ying Quartet, tomorrow. Next week there are free master classes on Wednesday and another chamber concert on Thursday. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 8; tomorrow at Brook Farm, south on Route 41A; other events, First Presbyterian Church, 97 East Genesee Street, (315)685-7418; tonight and Thursday, $16 and $21, $13 for students and 65+; tomorrow, $18 and $24. (Oestreich)    TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) The conductor Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos and the Boston Symphony Orchestra kick off the weekend tonight with a Russian program that includes Rachmaninoff's ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,'' with Garrick Ohlsson as the piano soloist, and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade.'' And on Sunday afternoon, Peter Oundjian leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24, with Peter Serkin playing the solo line, and the Beethoven ''Eroica'' Symphony. But certainly a major draw this weekend will be the Saturday evening Boston Symphony concert, led by Marin Alsop, the new music director designate of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Yo-Yo Ma will join Ms. Alsop for the Barber Cello Concerto at the heart of a program that begins with Christopher Rouse's ''Rapture'' and ends with the Tchaikovsky Fifth. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200, $17 (lawn) to $96. (Kozinn)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

Wednesday through Aug. 28, Black Grace from New Zealand, a big hit last summer, moves into the Shawn, with Project Fukurow from Tokyo Thursday through Aug. 28 at the Duke. Canadiens at the Shawn tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m., $50; $45 for students, seniors 65+ and children.

(John Rockwell)    LINCOLN CENTER OUT-OF-DOORS (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) The week's dance attractions at this free, nicely relaxed festival begin on a very high note, with a performance by the Paul Taylor Dance Company (tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Damrosch Park Bandshell). Arthur Aviles and his Typical Theater troupe will salute disco dancing in the festival-commissioned ''Flow to the Groove'' (tomorrow at 5:45 p.m. on the plaza), followed by ''International Hip-Hop Exchange: The Underground Vanguard'' (Sunday at 7:30 p.m. at the bandshell) and a program shared by groups that include the companies of Ronald K. Brown, Jamel Gaines and Nathan Trice (Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. on the plaza). Another highlight is a program by the Stephen Petronio and Complexions companies (Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at the bandshell). Information: (212)875-5766 or www.lincolncenter.org. (Jennifer Dunning)    MOSTLY MOZART: MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Morris has been justly celebrated for his choices of and responses to a dizzying range of musical scores. The company will perform ''L'Allegro, Il Penseroso ed Il Moderato,'' a signature piece set to Handel. 8 p.m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500 or www.lincolncenter.org, $25 to $70. (Dunning)    THE NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL FRINGE FESTIVAL (Through Aug. 28) Emily Dickinson, Lynndie England and Frida Kahlo are among the inspirations in this irrepressible festival's dance highlights. Those highlights include five programs of work with an emphasis on the theatrical, by Nina Hein and Elyssa Dole, Refraction Arts Project (Sonnet Blanton and Julia M. Smith), the brAdS company (Monica Bucciantini), Compagnie de l'Entorse (David G. Tretiakoff and Charlotte Schioler), and Anandam (Brandy Leary and Prashant Gupta). For theater names and addresses and other attractions: (212) 279-4488, (888) 374-6436 (outside New York) or www.fringenyc.org; $15. (Dunning)    PATRICK SWAYZE & FRIENDS (Tuesday) The friends include Desmond Richardson and Rasta Thomas, who will dance, and Doug Varone, who will supply some choreography. The occasion is the release of Mr. Swayze's ''One Last Dance'' DVD, which will be celebrated by a performance and party that also raises money for the Joyce Theater Foundation. 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800, $75 and $150. (Dunning)    ''TRADITIONS, INVENTIONS AND EXCHANGE'' (Through Sunday) This video and sound installation by Mollie Davies documents a decade-long exchange between dancers and cultural leaders about shifting artistic landscapes in Indonesia, Japan and the United States. 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, www.AsiaSociety.org. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,'  through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 28. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400.(Michael Kimmelman)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. (See above.) (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    THE NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II and presaged aspects of Pop Art and Neo-Expressionism. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or his weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality, but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Oct. 9. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 31. Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures -- not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook in which he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)    IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'BODY AND OBJECTS' Depending on your mood, this three-person show might provoke thought or irritation. Most striking are Jiang Zhi's large photographs of two topless dancers, one a woman who has had a double mastectomy, the other a transsexual with breast implants. Tang Yi presents a series of photographs of a young woman blowing up colored balloons into a birdcage, and Chu Yun offers worn bars of soap as miniature sculptures formed by contact with his body. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)414-1169, through Sept. 2. (Johnson)    WILLIAM EGGLESTON 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Sept. 2 (Johnson)     JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)    'MEDITATIVE' The mellow but disciplined vibes emanating from this group show are partly attributable to its theme: all the work was inspired by the artists' experiences of meditation. Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212)675-7772, through Sunday, and Sept. 6 to 17. (Cotter)    'ON VIEW: PHOTOGRAPHING THE MUSEUM' Among 20 well-selected ways of picturing the museum are Elliot Erwitt's view of a naked, sculptural Diana aiming her arrow at an unsuspecting live male visitor; wax figures by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Diane Arbus; a specimen drawer full of cardinals (birds, that is) by Terry Evans; and the dreamlike image of three real foxes in a formal period room by Karen Knorr. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20- inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)    'REMARKABLE HANDS' Three Japanese make art by hand: Yayoi Deki creates gently psychedelic floral patterns with a finely pointed brush; Yoko Kawamoto paints small, photo-based pictures of junked cars and industrial sites with a dry but sensuous touch; and Tomoo Gokita, using chameleonlike skill and mischievous humor, draws many different kinds of pop-culture imagery. ATM, 511 West 20th Street, (212)375-0349, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)    'SELF-PRESERVATION SOCIETY' A longtime hold-out finally moves to Chelsea and opens a sleek space with a lively show of gallery regulars. Basketball fans must see Tom Sanford's comic-realist painting of last season's infamous brawl between the Pacers and the Pistons. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, (212)334-9255, through Sept. 3. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)    'A. B. NORMAL'  Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyper-realistic Zamboni made of rigid pale-green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    'MASTERS OF CONTEMPORARY SCULPTURE' If you disregard the ugly and pretentious installation piece by the dean of Arte Povera, Mario Merz, then 50 glass snowballs by Not Vital, a circle of granite chunks by Richard Long, a sculpture of stairs painted in Burmese red lacquer by Wolfgang Laib, a life-size simulation of an airplane lavatory by Tom Sachs and a 51-minute piece of Bruce Nauman's nocturnal video of his studio all add up to an almost perfectly satisfying show. Sperone Westwater, 415 13th Street, (212)999-7337, through Aug. 31. (Johnson)    Last Chance    MET: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD' In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. (See above.) Closes Sunday. (Smith)    'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' This big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-9300, closes today. (Cotter)    DAVID LEVINTHAL: 'XXX SEX DOLLS' Mr. Levinthal is known for his provocatively ironic photographs of war toys, racist kitsch and pornographic dolls. Here, along with faux-pornographic photographs, he presents 30 female miniatures from his collection; they are kitschy marvels of sexist fetishism. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)627-4819, closes today. (Johnson)    'CAPTURING A MOMENT-ITO' Highlights of this varied exhibition of works by nine Latino artists include Karina Aguilera Skvirsky's eerie video of vaguely menacing figures in Mideastern-style robes approaching in a peaceful park; portraits by Gabriel de la Mora, in which the apparently finely drawn lines are actually made of hair from the people depicted; Gino Rubert's Surrealistic paintings of dreamy erotic encounters; and Alfonso Cantú's drawings of people viewed through marbled glass. Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, (718)658-7400, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    GEERT GOIRIS, Among the most striking of the sumptuous and magical color photographs by this Belgian artist are pictures of an albino wallaby and of a mysterious explosion in a peaceful, parklike setting. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7700, closes Tuesday. (Johnson)    GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM' With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) Closing on Wednesday. (Glueck)    'WORDPLAY' Twenty-three artists toy with words and letters. The show includes comical, professional-looking signs by Steve Powers; sign letters arranged to spell ''Me'' in a photograph by Jack Pierson; a neon sign that says ''Just Wait,'' by Bill Rowe; an alphabet of letters made of little water puddles photographed by Abelardo Morell; and layered, hand-painted letters spelling the hidden phrase ''Weapons of Mass Destruction'' by Joe Amrhein. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)627-2410, closing today.
