'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' In previews; opens on Sunday.

'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' In previews; opens on Monday. Douglas Carter Beane's play, about a rising Hollywood male star who falls in love with a gay hustler, transfers to Broadway (2:00).

Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300.    'LA TEMPETE (THE TEMPEST)' Performances start on Wednesday. It's high-tech Shakespeare in this Montreal production, which includes virtual and real actors (1:40). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100.    'THE VERTICAL HOUR' In previews; opens on Nov. 30. Julianne Moore plays an American war correspondent turned academic in David Hare's much-buzzed-about new play. Sam Mendes directs (2:00). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to a demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap operatic contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' The brilliant Twyla Tharp interprets the Bob Dylan songbook less than brilliantly. When a genius goes down in flames, everybody feels the burn (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)    'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'EMERGENCE-SEE!' Daniel Beaty's solo show takes stock of the urban African-American mind in the new century, as dozens of men and women flock to Liberty Island when a slave ship mysteriously appears in New York Harbor. The performance captivates; the material doesn't (1:15). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    'LIVE GIRLS' Victoria Stewart's drama sends up the docudrama and an Anna Deavere Smith-like performance artist (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'MY DEAH'  ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'PORT AUTHORITY THROW DOWN' Mike Batistick's intercultural tale of an angry Pakistani cabdriver, a white Christian missionary from Ohio, a black homeless alcoholic and the driver's activist brother is far from profound, but it has some solid laughs, and its battered heart is in the right place (2:00). Culture Project at 45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE SUNSET LIMITED' Cormac McCarthy's elegiac two-man play distills his previous work into a debate about suicide (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned punch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'être is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'THE FLOOD' This eager show about a deluge in an Illinois town has a majestic score by Peter Mills and Cara Reichel and an able, ingratiating cast. Unfortunately, they're playing cookie-cutter characters (2:00). The American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Rob Kendt)    'STANLEY 2006' Todd D'Amour's performance-art piece rethinks Stanley Kowalski's feelings about Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' The work is striking and original but at times heavy on the angst (1:15). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Gates)    'THE GIVEN' Grim without being rewarding, Francine Volpe's drama involves a stripper, a gay man with H.I.V., another gay man who wants to be infected with H.I.V., and a married man who becomes a bit more than a good customer at a strip club. The playwright seems to hope that the mixture is explosive, but it's merely distasteful (2:20). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow.

(Zinoman)    'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35).

'ABSOLUTE WILSON' (No rating, 105 minutes) This appreciative look at the life and work of the theater artist Robert Wilson includes a notably candid interview with the man himself, as well as mostly friendly testimony from friends and experts and glimpses of his strange, difficult and often thrillingly original work. (A. O. Scott)    'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not-quite-simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inñáritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'CLIMATES' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Turkish) The story of a man and a woman, one of whom murders the other's love, and a haunting portrait of existential solitude. The Turkish writer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan also stars. (Dargis)    'COMMUNE' (No rating, 78 minutes) A breezy, informal history of the Black Bear Ranch, a long-running California commune begun in the summer of 1968 and still in existence, ''Commune'' offers the fascinating spectacle of observing people then and now. (Stephen Holden)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)    * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    * 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)    * 'JONESTOWN: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PEOPLES' TEMPLE' (No rating, 85 minutes) The scariest aspect of this powerful, meticulously chronicled history of Jim Jones and his flock, who committed mass suicide in Guyana on Nov. 18, 1978, is that so many of the followers of this demented demagogue appear to have been intelligent, idealistic, life-loving people. Watch this documentary and shudder. (Holden)    'THE LAST ATOMIC BOMB' (No rating, 92 minutes, in English, Japanese and French) This deeply affecting look at the bombing of Nagasaki and its aftermath is seen primarily through the eyes of a 70-year-old survivor named Sakue Shimohira, a tiny, tireless woman who now devotes herself to disseminating her harrowing story. Directed by the veteran documentarian Robert Richter, the film interweaves expert interviews with a remarkable collection of declassified films and photographs. The result is an unvarnished and blatantly emotional plea for nuclear disarmament whose images speak for themselves. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    'THE MAGIC GLOVES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Depression, drugs and professional stasis commingle in this limp Argentine comedy whose characters remain trapped several rungs below their aspirations. In the foreground of a featureless Buenos Aires, paths cross and lock without import, and lives inch sideways (a cab driver becomes a bus driver), in reflection of the country's larger economic blight. Yet the fleeting moments of deadpan humor are pungent enough to suggest that the writer and director, Martín Rejtman, is saving himself for greater things. (Catsoulis)    * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)    * 'THE PRESTIGE' (PG-13, 128 minutes) Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's new film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman) practicing their art in late-Victorian London. Scarlett Johansson is the lovely assistant. (Scott)    * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)    'ROMÁNTICO' (No rating, 80 minutes, in Spanish and English) The sympathetic portrait of a mariachi musician and illegal immigrant who returns to his Mexican hometown feels more like a mosaic than a narrative film with a clearly defined continuity. (Holden)    'THE SANTA CLAUS 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis)    'SAW III' (R, 107 minutes) The franchise rasps on with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the masked sadist whose fondness for men in chains continues unabated, playing marriage counselor to a couple whose young son has been killed in a car accident. Having learned the (knotted) ropes on ''Saw II,'' the 27-year-old Darren Lynn Bousman returns to direct, while James Wan and Lee Whannell push their original story to ever new heights of monstrousness. In the end, the most depressing thing about this franchise is not the creativity of the bloodletting but the bleak view of human nature, specifically our talent for ruining the present to avenge the past. (Catsoulis)    * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)    'UMRAO JAAN' (No rating, 145 minutes, in Hindi and Urdu) Weak dubbing and melodramatic overkill hamper this retelling of a historical Indian story, about the travails of a performing courtesan. But its star, Aishwarya Rai, a potent presence, appears destined for international success. (Andy Webster)    'UNKNOWN' (No rating, 90 minutes) This twisty thriller, which locks five men inside a dingy warehouse, where they regain consciousness with no recollection of who they are or how they got there, features a whole lot of buildup and a real letdown of a payoff. (Kern)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almódovar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    * 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters. (Dargis)    'WONDROUS OBLIVION' (No rating, 106 minutes) Form and content fight to the death in Paul Morrison's defiantly gauzy tale of racial friction in 1960s England. As a cricket-obsessed Jewish boy (Sam Smith) comes of age under the tutelage of his Jamaican neighbor (Delroy Lindo), the boy's mother (Emily Woof) experiences an awakening of her own. Bathing everything in an inappropriately peachy glow, Mr. Morrison serves up prejudice lite, joining the ranks of too many filmmakers who suggest that sports and sexual flirtation can cure all social ills. (Catsoulis)    Film Series    THE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE  (Through Dec. 31) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Rivette, the innovative French New Wave director, begins tonight.

This weekend's features include Pal Sandor's ''Daniel Takes a Train'' (1984), about two teenagers who decide to escape to the West; Attila Janisch's ''After the Day Before'' (2004), the story of a young girl's murder; and Gyorgy Szomjas's ''Vagabond,'' about a young drifter and Hungarian folk dancing.

AND YOU WILL KNOW US BY THE TRAIL OF DEAD, BLOOD BROTHERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Proving once again rock's inexhaustible lesson that loudness equals liberation, these two bands work their way to chaotic, cathartic peaks. Trail of Dead (as impatient fans call them), from Austin, Tex., gets there slowly and somewhat patiently, while the Blood Brothers, from Seattle, are a nonstop weapon of frantic noise and surrealist poetry (''Set fire to the face on fire''). At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario)    * 'Broadway Unplugged' (Monday) This third annual all-acoustic concert offers a rare opportunity to hear theatrically trained stars performing without microphones in an ideal setting. The many scheduled performers include John Lloyd Young, Beth Leavel, Marc Kudisch, Norm Lewis and Roosevelt Andre Credit (whose ''Ol' Man River'' last month at the Jerome Kern tribute stopped the show). At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25 to $75.

(Sisario)    CHRISTINA COURTIN, BELL ORCHESTRE (Thursday) Continuing its series of concerts straddling classical music and experimental pop, Merkin Concert Hall presents Christina Courtin, a recent Juilliard graduate who writes tender, capricious songs in the Regina Spektor idiom, and Bell Orchestre, a Canadian quintet that likes slow, broad soundscapes and includes a French hornist -- what could be more classical than that? At 8 p.m., 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, merkinconcerthall.org; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)    THE CULT (Monday) On leave from his job as a stand-in for Jim Morrison in the touring band that features former members of the Doors (a court order prevents it from using that name), Ian Astbury returns to his first job: a stand-in for Jim Morrison in the Cult, a British band of 1980s vintage that hitched the brooding melodrama of the Doors to the bruising guitar power of AC/DC. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $40. (Sisario)    * BOB DYLAN (Monday and Thursday) On his 32nd studio album, ''Modern Times'' (Columbia), Mr. Dylan is obsessed with the mythic past, serving up a sleek, bluesy time warp that dips into Muddy Waters, Bing Crosby and the obscure 19th-century ''poet laureate of the Confederacy,'' Henry Timrod. Even when studying contemporary popular culture, he is reminded of his own back pages: ''I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying,'' he sings. ''When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line.'' With Jack White's roadhouse band, the Raconteurs. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $39.50 to $79.50.

(Sisario)    'ENCUENTRO' (Sunday) An annual gathering of a diverse and inventive group of Colombian musicians in New York who mix traditional sounds with rock and jazz. Led by Pablo Mayor and his group Folklore Urbano, this fourth ''Encuentro'' (''Encounter'') also features Hector Martignon, Edmar Castaneda, Marta Gomez, Coba with Lucia Pulido, La Cumbiamba eNeYe and others. At 5 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $35. (Sisario)    ARETHA FRANKLIN (Tuesday) Ms. Franklin has said she intends to stop extensive touring, but she keeps coming back, to grateful crowds. After a rare appearance at the Apollo Theater this summer, she returns to the Hammerstein Ballroom. At 7 p.m., 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $75 to $500. (Sisario)    * GUNS N' ROSES (Tonight) Only Michael Jackson inspires more morbid curiosity than Axl Rose, who has spent 12 years recording the next Guns N' Roses album with a steadily rotating cast of replacements, only occasionally coming up for air and paparazzi. But he has been a common sight lately -- showing up in public (which is unusual) and completing tours (even more unusual) -- fueling speculation that the album, ''Chinese Democracy,'' might be ready for release soon. Patient fans are not holding their breath. With Papa Roach and Sebastian Bach. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171, thegarden.com; $49.50 to $89.50. (Sisario)    BRUCE HORNSBY (Tonight) Mr. Hornsby spent much of the 1990s touring as the pianist with the Grateful Dead and its spinoffs, and the experience transformed his own music. Even in earnest songs, he's freer and more playful, letting loose his two-handed virtuosity so that songs dance through jazz, gospel, country, Latin music and rock. At 8, the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; sold out. (Jon Pareles)    BERT JANSCH (Tuesday) One of the prime movers of the 1960s British folk scene, Mr. Jansch played knotty and expressive acoustic guitar that influenced Jimmy Page and Neil Young, and in songs like ''Needle of Death'' sang in an invitingly guileless voice of a bohemian demimonde. He has remained productive, but two things have brought him a new audience: his appearance on the soundtrack to ''The Squid and the Whale'' last year, and his embrace by young folk stars like Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart, who both appear on his new album, ''The Black Swan'' (Drag City). At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Sisario)    KIKI AND HERB (Wednesday and Thursday) Fresh from a run on Broadway, the world's most brilliantly perverse cabaret duo -- they've performed a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman'' -- begins a series of late-night shows in the intimate Joe's Pub. At 11:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario)    AMY MILLAN, ERIC BACHMANN (Thursday) When indie rockers dabble in country music, they tend to lose their sense of humor entirely. Ms. Millan, the guitarist of Stars, a band from Montreal that plays witty and sophisticated songs, cries a river of twang on her one-dimensional new solo album, ''Honey From the Tombs'' (Arts & Crafts), and Mr. Bachmann, under his own name or as Crooked Fingers, has long been obsessed with a grim Southern Gothic country-folk that has none of the sparkle of his former rock band, Archers of Loaf. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)    * MODEST MOUSE (Monday through Wednesday) A band so emblematic of 21st-century indie rock that it was mentioned by name in the Supreme Court's decision on MGM v. Grokster last year, Modest Mouse links antsy, catchy guitar lines to vocals that are always just a few shrieks away from a destructive tantrum. These three shows begin a five-concert New York series that is likely to show off songs from the band's long-delayed new album. Monday at 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $31.

(Sisario)    MARISA MONTE (Tuesday) One of Brazil's most sensual (and successful) singers, Ms. Monte took a break five years ago to have a child, and after a joint record with Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes, has returned with two superb new solo albums: ''Universo ao Meu Redor,'' which won a Latin Grammy last week, is made up of traditional sambas, and ''Infinito Particular'' (both on Metro Blue/Blue Note) sets her own compositions to orchestral and electronic accompaniment. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $49.50 to $78.50. (Sisario)    MOUSE ON MARS (Tomorrow) Since 1993, Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner, two German electronic musicians with a knack for surrealistic mischief, have been making some of the strangest and most compelling music on the planet out of slippery squiggles of sound that seem to dance around in space as if part of some wild sonic cartoon. At 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)    * JOANNA NEWSOM (Monday) The fairy queen of the freak-folk movement, Ms. Newsom uses a harp and her froggish little voice to spin elaborate, beguiling fantasies, always giving the sense that no matter how imaginative her music is, she is capable of much, much more. Her latest, ''Ys'' (Drag City), contains five dense orchestrated songs that are on average about 11 minutes long. With P. G. Six, also known as the guitarist Pat Gubler. At 5 and 9:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)    OAKLEY HALL, MICAH P. HINSON (Tonight) Patient country-folk mutates into powerful, throbbing drones in the songs of Oakley Hall, a Brooklyn band led by Pat Sullivan, a former member of Brooklyn's other masters of psychedelic minimalism, Oneida. With a groaning, melancholic baritone and fractured guitar chords, Mr. Hinson, from Abilene, Tex., sings of regret, wasted lives and the sacrifice of ''rock 'n' roll's worst leading guy.'' At 7:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. Mr. Hinson also plays tomorrow night at 7:30 at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $8. (Sisario)    PLASTIC PEOPLE OF THE UNIVERSE (Monday) In Prague in the 1960s, the Plastic People of the Universe transmuted the lessons of Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground into dank, dissonant, precise songs that drew the wrath of Czechoslovakia's Communist government. But the reconstituted band's songs are more than period pieces; by finding a rock language for Eastern European angst, they turn desperation inside out. The guitarist Gary Lucas opens the show with his band Gods and Monsters. At 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Pareles)    PLUS-44 (Tuesday) It's not often that the rivaling former members of a multiplatinum band pass through the same club, giving curious fans a controlled experiment to judge who has made out better. Last year the boys-will-be-boys pop-punk band Blink-182 went on acrimonious hiatus, and one of its two singers, Tom DeLonge, started a new group, Angels and Airwaves; it played the Bowery Ballroom in May. Now come the two other alumni, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, with their own band, Plus-44. Both groups are darker and more emo-influenced than Blink-182, and unfortunately for fans scrambling for a way into this show, neither has much of the fire of their former band. At 8 p.m., with the Matches, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)    ROBERT POLLARD (Monday) One of the most prolific and gifted songwriters in alternative rock -- or any kind of rock -- Mr. Pollard, now 49, dissolved his long-running band Guided by Voices two years ago but has persisted with the style and work ethic of that band, releasing a small stack of solo albums and EP's whose songs vary from indulgent lo-fi sketches to clean, crisp glories of guitar-rock that conjure the best of the Who and Big Star. At 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $23 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)    * SCRITTI POLITTI (Tonight) Green Gartside, the 51-year-old Welsh singer and songwriter who is the core of Scritti Politti, works slowly and deliberately. A bright light in the confrontationally arty post-punk scene in the late 70s, he turned in the 80s to sweet and almost classically elegant pop; Miles Davis performed one of his songs in admiration. His latest album, ''White Bread Black Beer'' (Nonesuch), is one of his strongest in years, and his band is only now on its first American tour. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $20. (Sisario)    TWILIGHT SINGERS (Thursday) Greg Dulli led the Afghan Whigs before he started the more introspective Twilight Singers, who help him wallow in loneliness and romantic insecurity as he confesses all in his smoky voice. At 8:30 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $22. (Pareles)    WITCHCRAFT (Tonight) No, that's not Black Sabbath playing some long-lost track from 1971. It's Witchcraft, a Swedish band that even in a deeply retro metal culture stands out for a remarkable simulacrum of its heroes' knuckle-dragging fuzz-blues, even down to Magnus Pelander's helium-voiced Ozzy Osbourne. If Black Sabbath made it look easy, Witchcraft makes it look even easier. With Danava. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $12.

(Chinen)    STEVE DAVIS QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Update'' (Criss Cross), the new album by the trombonist Steve Davis, earns its title by gently bringing 1950s hard bop into a modern sphere. Mr. Davis enacts a similar process with his quintet, which features the saxophonist Mike DiRubbo.

(Chinen)    * ANDREW HILL OCTET (Tuesday) Three years ago Blue Note Records issued ''Passing Ships,'' recorded by the pianist Andrew Hill in 1969. It was a revelation: Mr. Hill's compositions suggest a lyrically focused approach to avant-garde exploration. The album receives an unprecedented concert interpretation by Mr. Hill, 69, with an ensemble that includes the trumpeter Keyon Harrold and the trombonist Curtis Fowlkes; of note is the participation of Howard Johnson, who played tuba and bass clarinet on the album.

Their lone album, ''Thought Trains'' (Sons of Sound), was released in 2004 but recorded back in 1996, and it's a safe bet that the band's sound has evolved since then. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20.

And it will probably be good, because you have to work hard to mess up ''Barber.'' Diana Damrau, a much-praised soprano, is the Rosina; Peter Mattei is Figaro; and Maurizio Benini conducts.

Julianna Di Giacomo and James Maddalena are still highlights of the cast, with Julius Rudel conducting. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Bernard Holland)    'The Elixir of Love' (Tonight, Tuesday and Thursday) Jonathan Miller has created an all-American version of Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that is dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elisir'' is a delightful opera, and that prevails whatever you think of the director's conceit (using the word advisedly). The second cast of the run includes the American tenor Leonardo Capalbo, making his company debut as Nemorino, and Georgia Jarman, a fine soprano, as his Adina. Gerald Steichen conducts. Tonight at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)    'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Opera is big and loud, ''children's theater'' is light and fun, and Engelbert Humperdinck's classic represents an uneasy juxtaposition of the two. By setting the action in 1890s New York, City Opera moves the story into a more adult or believable realm, with Hansel and Gretel as immigrant children lapsing into German ditties in a singing English translation, but without losing some of the important elements, like the witch going into the oven at the end. The singers trade off between performances; Jennifer Aylmer and Jennifer Rivera are one pair of leads who do a fine job. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $115. (Midgette)    * 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The abstract staging of this visually beautiful production by the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-sized puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly, and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts tomorrow, and James Levine conducts on Wednesday. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)    * 'ORPHÉE AUX ENFERS' (Wednesday) This Offenbach sendup of the Orfeo and Euridice story (and specifically of Gluck's operatic version of the tale) is one of this composer's cleverest operettas. The Juilliard Opera Center is presenting an ambitious production of this work, directed by John Pascoe (who also designed the sets and costumes) and conducted by the admirable Anne Manson. The later, stronger 1874 version will be presented. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; $20. (Tommasini)    * TEATRO GRATTACIELO (Tomorrow) With its boundless enthusiasm for Italian opera from the verismo school, which flourished in the early 20th century, Teatro Grattacielo has been drawing loyal audiences to its performances of some very obscure works. Tomorrow is the North American premiere of a Zandonai opera, ''La Farsa Amorosa.'' David Wroe conducts a full orchestra, chorus and cast. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $25 to $75. (Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. José Cura is a bad-boy Cavaradossi who proves, when he sings out, also to be vocally uneven; he sings tomorrow, but Vincenzo La Scola will sing the role on Tuesday. James Morris is a known and growly quantity as Scarpia. The real news is the company debut of the conductor Nicola Luisotti, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 to $375 tickets remaining for tomorrow, $15 to $375 on Tuesday. (Midgette)    Classical Music    * AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA  (Thursday) The composer Derek Bermel has won acclaim for pulsating works that vividly draw from classical, jazz and rock idioms. He has begun a three-year stint as composer in residence with this orchestra, which is collaborating for the first time with Jazz at Lincoln Center to present the premiere of his new work, ''The Migration Series.'' The program includes music by Gershwin, Mingus and John Lewis. Steven Sloane conducts. At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; sold out. (Tommasini)    SÉRGIO AND ODAIR ASSAD (Tonight) This superb fraternal guitar duo move easily between the classical repertory and Latin pop, and this concert -- although it includes works by Ginastera, Copland (an arrangement of ''Hoe Down'' from ''Rodeo'') and Agustín Barrios -- edges more than usually toward the pop side. Paquito D'Rivera plays clarinet with the group in a program that includes music of his own, as well as pieces by Egberto Gismonti, Astor Piazzolla, Angel Villoldo, Rey Guerra, Eliseo Grenet and Pixinguinha. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48. (Allan Kozinn)    KRISTIAN BEZUIDENHOUT (Tuesday) This South African harpsichordist and fortepiano player performs a program called ''J. S. Bach Sturm and Drang,'' with Le Nuove Musiche, a period-instrument ensemble. The concert includes the Ciaconna from Bach's Partita in D minor; Benda's Sonata in A minor; Hertel's Piano Concerto in F minor; and Mozart's Rondo in A minor (K. 511) and Piano Concerto in A (K. 414). At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $21 for students. (Vivien Schweitzer)    JONATHAN BISS AND BENJAMIN HOCHMAN (Wednesday) These talented pianists perform Mozart's Sonata in F for Piano Four Hands; Schubert's Fantasy in F minor for Piano Four Hands; and Schumann/Debussy: Six Pieces in Canonic Form for Two Pianos. They will be joined by James Deitz and Ayano Kataoka for Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer)    BORROMEO STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Peoples' Symphony Concerts organization has been offering a chance to hear first-rate artists at a wallet-friendly price since the conductor Franz X. Arens founded it in 1900. Tomorrow the Borromeo will play Osvaldo Golijov's ''Tenebrae,'' Shostakovich's Quartet No. 3 and Brahms's Clarinet Quintet, with Richard Stoltzman. At 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, 16th Street and Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. (Schweitzer)    * BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) With the Boston Symphony, the music director James Levine is in the midst of a programming adventure in which works by two revolutionaries, Beethoven and Schoenberg, are paired. For this concert at Carnegie Hall, though, he pairs works by two other path-breakers: Brahms's Symphony No. 1 and Bartok's gripping one-act opera ''Bluebeard's Castle.'' Albert Dohmen sings the role of the fearsome, secretive Duke Bluebeard, and Anne Sofie von Otter is Judith, his tragically innocent new wife. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $127. (Tommasini)    BRENTANO STRING QUARTET AND MITSUKO UCHIDA (Tomorrow) Prime musicians play a prime program that includes Mozart's Piano Quartet in G minor, the Bartok Second String Quartet and the Schumann Piano Quintet. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $50 and $68, with limited availability. (Holland)    'ECCE COR MEUM'  (Tuesday) Few composers of any stripe can touch Paul McCartney's melodies, and this choral work -- his third large-scale score -- has some lovely touches. It is also about as conservative as can be, and would have been fully at home a century ago. Recently issued on CD, it has its New York premiere with Kate Royal as the soprano soloist with the Concert Chorale of New York, the American Boychoir and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by Gavin Greenaway. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $125. (Kozinn)    ENSEMBLE EUROPÉEN WILLIAM BYRD (Sunday) This Paris-based vocal quintet, directed by Graham O'Reilly, makes its New York debut with a program of motets by Charpentier, Du Mont, Moulinié and Brossard. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+. (Kozinn)    JUiLLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) This first-rate young orchestra, conducted by George Manahan, will play Stravinsky's ''Chant du Rossignol,'' Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' and Prokofiev's Sinfonia Concertante (Op. 125), with Anna Burden, a 22-year-old American cellist. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Schweitzer)    JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Tonight) Now an American chamber music institution, this ensemble celebrates its 60th anniversary with a traversal of the Bartok string quartet cycle, the group's signature repertory since its earliest days. The first installment was on Wednesday, and it concludes the set tonight with Nos. 2, 4 and 6. At 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)    GIDON KREMER, ANDREI PUSHKAREV AND ANDRIUS ZLABYS (Sunday) The 60-minute Movado Hour series, inaugurated last fall after the completion of the Baryshnikov Arts Center, continues with a concert by Mr. Kremer, a violinist; Mr. Pushkarev, a percussionist; and Mr. Zlabys, a pianist. They will play works by Bach, Busoni, Tickmayer and Piazzolla. At 6 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 218-7540, baryshnikovdancefoundation.org; free, but reservations are required. (Schweitzer)    MARYINSKY ACADEMY OF YOUNG SINGERS (Tonight through Sunday night) Shostakovich, the ''other'' birthday boy, would have been 100 this year, and some of the most interesting musical tributes have been to him. This weekend the Maryinsky offers a three-concert survey of his songs, presented by some recognized young singers from its training program. Daniil Shtoda, a tenor who made a bit of a splash a few years back, sings tonight, and the mezzo Ekaterina Semenchuk, who competed in the 2001 Cardiff Singer of the World, is on all three programs. The concerts are grouped roughly chronologically, with exceptions, from Opus 21 tonight (''Six Romances on Texts of Japanese Poets'') to Opus 145 on Sunday night (Five Songs from ''Michelangelo Suite''). At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26. (Midgette)    MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) This concert features chamber music by performers linked to the summer school and festival in Vermont. Seven players mix and match to play Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok and Mozart. At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Holland)    ANNE-SOPHIE MUTTER  (Wednesday) This German violinist and her longstanding collaborator at the piano, Lambert Orkis, give one of their regular Carnegie Hall recitals. The anniversary year (you know whose) is coming to an end, but the celebration isn't slowing down. So once again it's all Mozart, with five violin and piano sonatas. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $98. (Holland)    NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Thursday) Joel Sachs leads his young players in another foray into contemporary music. The composers come from Australia, Argentina, England, Brazil and right around the corner. The pieces are either brand-new or at most 10 years old. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)    'NEW SOUNDS LIVE' (Tonight) The composer Phil Kline's best-known works use boomboxes and other street-level devices, but his latest score, ''John the Revelator'' -- commissioned by WNYC and influenced by everything from the Bible to the blues -- will be given its premiere by Lionheart, the early-music vocal ensemble, and Ethel, the new-music string quartet. At 7, Winter Garden at the World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Wednesday and Thursday) Fans of this series don't go to a concert for a particular program but for what is always an entertaining evening of unfamiliar music, wittily elucidated by Steven Blier. ''Brava Italia'' is the theme of this week's (repeated) recital, with 20th-century Italian song, from Puccini and Mascagni onward, as its putative scope, and the definition of ''Italian'' stretched to include any composer with an Italian name: Dominick Argento, John Musto. Singers include Carolyn Betty, Sasha Cooke and Jeremy Little. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $45; $35 for 65+. (Midgette)    ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tuesday) The celebrations for the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth aren't over yet. The choir and Concert Royal, an early-music group, will perform a concert of sacred choral works, led by John Scott. The program includes ''Vesperae Solennes de Confessore,'' ''Exsultate, Jubilate,'' ''Ave Verum Corpus'' and the ''Coronation'' Mass in C. The soloists are Jolle Greenleaf, a soprano; Malin Fritz, an alto; Brian Register, a tenor; and Craig Phillips, a bass. At 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org; $25 to $60. (Schweitzer)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

(Jennifer Dunning)    * RAE BALLARD (Sunday) Ms. Ballard, a distinctively thoughtful, measured modern-dance choreographer, honors veterans in a performance of her new ''Long Road Home,'' an exploration of how soldiers, both men and women, integrate memories of war with their present-day realities. At 2 p.m., Yonkers Riverfront Library Auditorium, 1 Larkin Center, Yonkers, (914) 337-1500, ypl.org; free. (Dunning)    BATTERY DANCE COMPANY (Wednesday and Thursday) The program of dances by the company director, Jonathan Hollander, will include solos created for the alumni Tadej Brdnik, Virginie Mecene and Ariel Bonilla, current and former soloists with the Martha Graham Dance Company. Wednesday at 1 p.m., Thursday at 1 and 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 219-3910; $20; $10 for students and 65+.

(Through Nov. 26.) Thursday at 7:30 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $20; $15 for students. (Dunning)    DEEPLY ROOTED DANCE THEATER (Tonight) Based in Chicago and directed by New York's own Kevin Jeff, the company will present ''Classical Roots: An Evening in Three Acts,'' a program that draws on the troupe's African-American modern-dance aesthetic. The dances are set to music that ranges from gospel, blues and hip-hop to Bach and Dvorak. At 8, Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 58th Street, Clinton, (866) 468-7619, ticketweb.com; $35, $45 and $100. (Dunning)    LAWRENCE GOLDHUBER (Tonight through Sunday) O.K., O.K., we know this is billed as ''theater,'' that dull alternative art form. But Mr. Goldhuber has many dance fans, so we thought we'd let you know he's performing ''SWELL(ing) Relatives,'' an excursion into the world of a man who must hold down his floating possessions with 1,000 potatoes. Valeria Vasilevski is the director. At 10, La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15. (Dunning)    * LARRY KEIGWIN/KEIGWIN & COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Keigwin is that rare blend of humanism and sly humor. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $20. (Dunning)    PETER KYLE DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) In its New York City debut, this modern-dance company will pay tribute to Murray Louis, one of the grand old men of American modern dance and a mentor to Peter Kyle, who performed with the Nikolais/Louis troupe in the 1990s. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; Sunday at 3 p.m., Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101; $15. (Dunning)    * LIMÓN DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday through Thursday) The Limón Dance Company is celebrating its 60th anniversary and remains a valued repository of American modern-dance history. Its two-week Joyce season will include revivals of works by José Limón and Doris Humphrey and a Lar Lubovitch premiere. (Through Nov. 26.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40.

Who knows what you'll see? That's exactly the point. At 8 p.m., Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 598-0551, movementresearch.org; free. (Claudia La Rocco)    MALINA RAUSCHENFELS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Ms. Rauschenfels, who studied music at the Eastman School and Juilliard, promises ''an army of choreographers,'' which includes Sue Bernhard and Jody Oberfelder, in a program of dance set to cello and live chamber music. Tomorrow at 7 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center Studio 5, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (917) 754-5549; $10 to $20 suggested donation.

(Tomorrow) Pablo Aslan, the Argentine-born bassist-composer who has worked with the filmmaker Carlos Saura and the singers Julio Iglesias and Shakira, aims here at the modernization of the tango in music and dance, performed by his Advantango troupe and presented by the World Music Institute and the Skirball Center. At 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $40 and $45.

(Dunning)    CLAUDE WAMPLER (Thursday) Is it dance? Performance art? Or something else? Ms. Wampler has made a career of blending performing and visual arts in category-defying ways. Her work also questions the role of the audience, but don't all her projects? (Through Nov. 18.) At 7 and 9:30 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning)    ELLIS WOOD DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) In August Ms. Wood offered 20 women cavorting in red fabric among the neo-Classical columns of Cipriani on Wall Street; her piece was short, feminist and a little forced. Now she is back with an evening-length indoor work about ''the relationship between women and the elements: air, fire, earth and water.'' At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Rockwell)    * WORKS & PROCESS: DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM (Sunday and Monday) If we can't see full-stage performances by the company, on hiatus now after financial problems, this is the next-best thing. Excerpts from new ballets by Endalyn Taylor, Robert Garland and Keith Saunders will be performed on a program that also includes a panel discussion with Arthur Mitchell, the company's director, and the choreographers. At 7:30 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587; sold out. (Dunning)    Kota Yamazaki (Thursday) Versed in Butoh, modern dance and ballet, Mr. Yamazaki has dabbled in a host of forms, from traditional African dance to vernacular American street dancing. Expect to see a little of everything in ''Rise:Rose.'' (Through Nov. 18.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $12 and $20. (La Rocco)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * Bronx Museum of the Arts, 'Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sunshower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)    Brooklyn Museum: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Roberta Smith)    * Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,'  through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal peity. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,'  through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Grace Glueck)    Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Americans in Paris: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7719, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    The Met: 'Coaxing the Spirits to Dance,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)    MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them François Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)    * Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * Moma: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith)    NEWARK MUSEUM, the Jewish Museum: 'Masters of American Comics,' through Jan. 28. Organized by the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it made a splash, this show has come east, cut in size and split between the far-flung Newark and Jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. Art Spiegelman, one of the masters who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work. Still, the show shouldn't be missed. It spotlights artists like Chris Ware and Gary Panter, amazing state-of-the-art talents and endearing in the tradition of all those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their rooms when other kids wouldn't play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, ''I told you so.'' Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, (973) 596-6550, newarkmuseum.org; and the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir: High Plane,' through May 7. Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir's ''High Plane V,'' a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)    * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. The entirely nonobjective Suprematist work of Kasimir Malevich, for instance, was based in part on Ukrainian folk motifs, and the exuberant Cubist-Futurist theater designs and paintings by Alexandra Exter relate to icons and patterns from village embroideries and weavings and bright peasant costumes. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck).    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)    The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Kimmelman)    Galleries    Anant Joshi Cities in Asia are changing fast. They're going up and coming down at about equal speed. Urban culture, flooded with global goods and media, is changing too. Inevitably, such transformations have a big impact on art, and they are the subjects of new work by Anant Joshi, who lives and works in Mumbai. Paintings show a vision of the city modeled on commercial packing materials. Small sculptures, monuments to consumerist chaos, are assembled from hundreds of miniature toys, all made in China. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com, through Nov. 18. (Cotter)    Last Chance    * NICK CAVE: SOUNDSUITS Whether the efforts of this Chicago designer/artist qualify as fashion, body art or sculpture, they fall squarely under the heading of Must Be Seen to Be Believed. Worn in performance and covering the artist from head to toe and beyond, they also suggest mysterious ritual costumes of possibly African origin or aliens from a galaxy of extravagantly fashion-conscious planets. Embroidery, beads and especially sequins join forces with Easter grass, found fabrics, old sweaters, twigs and dryer lint, to bedazzling effect. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 654-1701; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    Robert Colescott: 'A Survey of Paintings' It's good to have Robert Colescott back in town for his first New York solo show here since 2000. Now 81, Mr. Colescott has been dealing in a slap-in-the-face way with race, class, sex and American life for nearly 40 years. His early pictures, like ''George Washington Carver Crossing the Delaware'' (1975), were riffs on museum classics; the five paintings from the 1990s in this mini-survey are a lot harder to pin down. They're richly and expressively painted; they don't hinge on a joke or a clear-cut contrast between good and bad, though they tend to feel bad, in a bad-dream way, and sick-joke funny. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    * DICE THROWN (WILL NEVER ANNUL CHANCE) This admirably focused exhibition reveals the ways that 12 emerging and recently emerged artists push at the boundaries of photography -- mixing found, appropriated and made (or even drawn) images in ways that expand the medium's technical means and make it resonate in time, space and memory. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959; closes tomorrow.

5," Last year a group of pianists intent on shining a spotlight on contemporary keyboard composition banded together to present KEYS TO THE FUTURE, a festival devoted to new and recent scores. For this year's installment, six pianists (Polly Ferman, Blair McMillen, Lisa Moore, Tatjana Rankovich, Joseph Rubenstein and Lora Tchekoratova) will play 27 works. Modern classics are included, among them Toru Takemitsu's ''Rain Tree Sketch II'' and Henri Dutilleux's ''Jeu des Contraires'' and works by Luciano Berio, Leo Ornstein and Arvo Pärt, but there will also be 10 premieres. And the stylistic range is as eclectic as can be, touching on music by Osvaldo Golijov and Lowell Liebermann, Latin-tinged scores by Astor Piazzolla, Pedro Saenz and Juan José Ramos, a work by the jazz pianist Brad Mehldau and a couple of Christopher O'Riley's piano arrangements of Radiohead songs. Tuesday through Thursday at 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770, keystothefuture.org; $15, $10 for students and 65+.    One composer with a premiere on the program is PHIL KLINE, making this a busy week for him. Mr. Kline's most famous works use boomboxes and other street-level devices, but his latest score, ''John the Revelator'' -- a work commissioned by WNYC and influenced by everything from the Bible to the blues -- will be given its premiere by LIONHEART, the early-music vocal ensemble, and ETHEL, the new-music string quartet. Friday at 7 p.m., Winter Garden at the World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free.    Like Mr. Kline, the composers DAVE SOLDIER and JONATHAN KANE are interested in the decidedly noncommercial crossroads of new-music iconoclasm and experimental rock, and they are jointly celebrating their 50th birthdays by performing with their bands -- Mr. Soldier's SPINOZAS, Mr. Kane's FEBRUARY, and the KROPOTKINS, in which they both perform. Monday at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $10. The Spinozas and the Kropotkins will also perform on Tuesday at Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934, zebuloncafeconcert.com; admission is by donation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/arts/the-week-ahead-nov-5-11-classical.html,"Last year a group of pianists intent on shining a spotlight on contemporary keyboard composition banded together to present KEYS TO THE FUTURE, a festival devoted to new and recent scores.

Broadway    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)    'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Indifferently directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap operatic contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' The brilliant choreographer Twyla Tharp interprets the Bob Dylan songbook less than brilliantly. And when a genius goes down in flames, everybody feels the burn (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)    'ASCENSION' Brandon Ruckdashel makes a stunning debut in Edmund De Santis's clever comic mystery about a priest, a beautiful young man and a mother's accusation of sexual abuse (1:30). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates)    'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'EMERGENCE-SEE!' Daniel Beaty's solo show takes stock of the urban African-American mind in the new century, as dozens of men and women flock to Liberty Island when a slave ship mysteriously appears in New York Harbor. The performance captivates; the material doesn't (1:15). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GIVEN' Grim without being rewarding, Francine Volpe's drama involves a stripper, a gay man with H.I.V., another gay man who wants to become infected with H.I.V., and a married man who becomes a bit more than a good customer at a strip club. The playwright seems to be hoping that the mixture proves explosive, but it's merely distasteful (2:20). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)    * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    'MY DEAH'  ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp workroom, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35) Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'THE VOYAGE OF THE CARCASS' The playwright Dan O'Brien succeeds admirably at evoking an atmosphere of tedium and claustrophobia. His play-within-a-play -- a vehicle for Dan Fogler-- is about a failed expedition of Arctic explorers frozen up together for seven years, who turn out to be a trio of sophomoric actors bickering in embarrassing dialogue about their lives, their relationships and their gas pains as they work together on a play about a failed expedition of Arctic explorers frozen up together for seven years. If this seems repetitive, it gives only a hint of the tedium in store for audiences (2:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515. (Anne Midgette)    'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned punch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'être is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'THE FLOOD' This eager, accomplished show about a devastating deluge in a small Illinois town has a majestic score by Peter Mills and Cara Reichel and an able, ingratiating cast. Unfortunately they're playing uninvolving, cookie-cutter characters (2:00). The American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Kendt)    'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line,'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE CARTELLS' Douglas Carter Beane is giving some of his actor friends something constructive to do on Monday nights with this ridiculous staged soap opera about a dysfunctional oil family. Each week brings a different episode, rehearsal time is minimal (cue cards are involved), and the actors -- Brian d'Arcy James, Joanna Gleason and Elizabeth Berkley among them -- are having a great time (50 minutes). Comix, 353 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 524-2500; closes on Monday. (Genzlinger)    'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Monday. (Midgette)    'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring André De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'KRANKENHAUS BLUES' Sam Forman's bizarre tale of an actress, a playwright and a clown in a Nazi camp goes off the deep end fast, but there's a great monologue about cheese (1:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)    'SHAY DUFFIN AS BRENDAN BEHAN: CONFESSIONS OF AN IRISH REBEL' Mr. Duffin's uneven, often charming one-man show offers Behan's thoughts on drinking, great men, drinking, politics and drinking (1:15). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)    'A SMALL MELODRAMATIC STORY' Small, yes, melodramatic, not so much. Stephen Belber's minor drama about a woman in Washington and the two men and two mysteries in her life benefits from sharp but unshowy performances, but feels like cop-show leftovers nonetheless (1:40). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'TRUTH $(the heart is a million little pieces above all things$)'  The virtuoso storyteller Mike Daisey's new monologue, which addresses issues about lying, memoir and the James Frey scandal, is less funny than his previous work but just as engaging and intellectually curious (1:40). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'YOHEN' Philip Kan Gotenda's drama about an interracial marriage may not be completely believable but has two lovely low-key performances and genuine warmth. The West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 868-4030; closes on Sunday. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ABSOLUTE WILSON' (No rating, 105 minutes) This appreciative look at the life and work of the theater artist Robert Wilson includes a notably candid interview with the man himself, as well as mostly friendly testimony from friends and experts and glimpses of his strange, difficult and often thrillingly original work. (A. O. Scott)    'AS THE CALL, SO THE ECHO' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Vietnamese) Keir Moreano's muted yet moving record of his father's experience as a volunteer physician in Vietnam documents a journey that's substantially more philosophical than medical. Following Dr. Alex Moreano, an ear, nose and throat surgeon from Albuquerque, as he treats advanced disease and reflects on his profession, the movie presents a portrait not of a saint but of a complicated man who understands that one of the lives he's saving is his own. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not-quite-simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inñáritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)    'THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI' (No rating, 76 minutes) David Lee Fisher has used cinematic magic to superimpose living, speaking actors onto the original sets of the silent-film classic. It's discombobulating, but interesting. (Neil Genzlinger)    'CATCH A FIRE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) The director Phillip Noyce revisits, with energy and a lot of bad editing, the ordeal of an ordinary black South African who became a foot soldier in the war against apartheid. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'CLIMATES' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Turkish) The story of a man and a woman, one of whom murders the other's love, and a haunting portrait of existential solitude. The Turkish writer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan also stars. (Dargis)    'COCAINE COWBOYS' (R, 118 minutes) A hyperventilating account of the blood-bathed Miami drug culture in the 1970s and '80s, Billy Corben's bottom-feeding documentary chronicles the explosion of South Florida's ''cocaine economy'' and the ensuing turf wars between the Colombians and the Cubans. Overflowing with cops and coroners, snitches and smugglers, the movie struggles with an atmosphere of unrepentant greed and a director overly impressed with his subject matter. (Catsoulis)    'CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD' (PG, 109 minutes) This movie ostensibly depicts the enlightenment of Neale Donald Walsch, the author of the popular series of inspirational books. But it merely becomes a maudlin feature-length advertisement for him and for them. (Andy Webster)    'DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' (No rating, 93 minutes) This fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, imagines what might happen if George W. Bush were assassinated. Condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by Gabriel Range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. Its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (Scott)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)    * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    'FLICKA' (PG, 110 minutes) A ridiculous redo of Mary O'Hara's 1941 children's novel that confirms that nothing should ever come between a girl and her horse, especially a saddle. (Dargis)    * 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)    'JAAN-E-MANN' (No rating, 165 minutes, in Hindi) This good-natured Bollywood musical is a romantic triangle set in New York. Personable stars partly make up for the excesses of the genre. (Anita Gates)    * 'JONESTOWN: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PEOPLES' TEMPLE' (No rating, 85 minutes) The scariest aspect of this powerful, meticulously chronicled history of Jim Jones and his flock, who committed mass suicide in Guyana on Nov. 18, 1978, is that so many of the followers of this demented demagogue appear to have been intelligent, idealistic, life-loving people. Watch this documentary and shudder. (Holden)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)    * 'THE PRESTIGE' (PG-13, 128 minutes) Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's new film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman) practicing their art in late-Victorian London. Scarlett Johansson is the lovely assistant. (Scott)    * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)    'RUNNING WITH SCISSORS' (R, 116 minutes) From Augusten Burroughs's best-selling memoir, this movie is a showcase of high-quality acting (especially from Annette Bening) without much in the way of dramatic coherence or emotional power. (Scott)    'SAW III' (R, 107 minutes) The franchise rasps on with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the masked sadist whose fondness for men in chains continues unabated, playing marriage counselor to a couple whose young son has been killed in a car accident. Having learned the (knotted) ropes on ''Saw II,'' the 27-year-old Darren Lynn Bousman returns to direct, while James Wan and Lee Whannell push their original story to ever new heights of monstrousness. In the end, the most depressing thing about this franchise is not the creativity of the bloodletting but the bleak view of human nature, specifically our talent for ruining the present to avenge the past. (Catsoulis)    * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)    'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash asks: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee)    '20 CENTIMETERS' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Spanish) During narcoleptic spells, a pre-op transsexual prostitute dreams that she is the star performer of huge, spicy (and frustratingly hit or miss) song-and-dance numbers. (Laura Kern)    * 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters. (Dargis)    Film Series    'HEROIC GRACE II: SHAW BROTHERS RETURN' (Through Nov. 28) BAMcinématek and the U.C.L.A. Film & Television Archive are sponsoring this sequel to their Shaw Brothers series, honoring the Chinese movie studio that spread the gospel of martial arts films. It begins on Monday with Chung Chang-Wha's ''King Boxer'' (1972), better known here as ''The Five Fingers of Death,'' about an injured fighter who finds a way to have his revenge. Tuesday's film is Chor Yuen's ''Magic Blade'' (1976), an epic set in a fantasy underworld.

Andreas Dresen's ''Summer in Berlin'' (2005) is about a single mother, her roommate and the men in her life. ''Next Generation'' (2006) is a 90-minute sampling of new works from German film schools, including Tim Weimann and Tom Bracht's ''My Date From Hell,'' in English. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10.

Features include Jan Svankmajer's animated and live-action ''Lunacy'' (2005), about a traveler who meets the Marquis de Sade, and Dan Wlodarczyk's ''Indian and the Nurse'' (2006), about a Romany woman who falls in love with a Czech sawmill worker. BAM Rose Cinemas, (718) 636-4100, www.bam.org; $10. (Gates)    REEL JEWS FILM FESTIVAL (Through Nov. 11.) Makor's seventh annual festival honoring young Jewish filmmakers begins on Monday.

TRACE ADKINS (Wednesday) A brawny performer who likes to sing about his scars and working-class bona fides, Mr. Adkins already had 10 hits in the country Top 10 before ''Honky Tonk Badonkadonk'' last year. But that ode to the voluptuous -- which brought a nugget of black slang to truckstop jukeboxes across the country -- cemented his image as a drawling ruffian who is not above a kinky gimmick. At 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $45. (Ben Sisario)    BLACK KEYS (Tonight) This guitar-drums duo from Akron, Ohio, aims to summon elemental forces with gruff, spare blues-rock, though a lack of imagination (''My heart's on fire/With a strange desire'') impedes its progress. With the Black Angels. At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $25. (Sisario)    * THE CLIPSE (Tomorrow) Four years ago this Virginia rap duo rose all the way to No. 4 with sly rhymes about the criminal life and brilliantly minimal rhythm tracks by the Neptunes. Since then the Clipse, made up of the brothers Gene and Terrence Thornton, have struggled in music-industry purgatory but remained active in the underground, and at the end of the month will release ''Hell Hath No Fury'' (Re-Up Gang/Jive), one of the most eagerly awaited hip-hop albums of the year. A CMJ Music Marathon show, with Trae, Kidz in the Hall, Jokaman, Catchdubs and DJ Chill. At 10:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)    DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS (Wednesday and Thursday) Not all rock revolutions are loud. Death Cab for Cutie, one of the handful of groups that defined emo at the turn of the millennium, launched a thousand bands with gentle, sinewy guitar; library-level vocals; and songs that found heartbreak everywhere, including glove compartments. For loudness, make sure to come early for Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, a veteran pop-punk band from New Jersey whose leader is one of the best songwriters in the game. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; Wednesday sold out, $39.50 on Thursday. (Sisario)    DECEMBERISTS (Tonight) He might not exactly have a lot of competition, but Colin Meloy, the songwriter and strategist of this ascendant band from Portland, Ore., can set old Irish epics and alliterative fables about Dickensian chimney sweeps to shambling folk-rock like nobody else. The band recently released ''The Crane Wife'' -- based on a classic Japanese story -- on Capitol Records, and plays at the CMJ Music Marathon as an example of success. With Alasdair Roberts, a Scottish folk singer. At 8, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $29.50. (Sisario)    THE FALL (Tomorrow) Nearly 30 years ago, this British band laid out with jagged guitars and the tuneless slur of its leader, Mark E. Smith, a reductionist ''three R's'' of pop: ''Repetition, repetition, repetition.'' Umpteen albums later, the Fall is a cornerstone of post-punk, and Mr. Smith still finds ways to make repetition sound new. A CMJ Music Marathon show, with Yikes, Iran, and Women and Children. At 6 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 260-4700, bowerypresents.com; $22. (Sisario)    KEVIN FEDERLINE (Tomorrow) Schadenfreude has a face, and it is Mr. Federline, the husband of Britney Spears, who, despite vicious ridicule online and elsewhere, has persisted with his feeble rap career. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)    GOB IRON (Wednesday) Jay Farrar of Son Volt and Anders Parker of Varnaline have built careers on the idea of ragged, rock-tinged ''roots'' music: a little less grungy than Neil Young, a bit more plebeian than Bob Dylan. They delve deeply into country, blues and folk on ''Death Songs for the Living'' (Transmit Sound/Legacy), their new joint album as Gob Iron. With liberal interpretations of songs by the Carter Family, Josh White and Stephen Foster, Mr. Farrar and Mr. Parker repaint centuries of American music in gray, relentlessly bleak tones: even Clarence Ashley's sprightly and elliptical ''Coo-Coo Bird'' gets a despondent rewrite as ''Nicotine Blues.'' At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario)    AL GREEN (Tonight and tomorrow night) As unpredictable as Al Green concerts can sometimes be -- maybe he will perform only gospel, maybe he will do some of his transcendent 1970s soul ballads -- the pattern is always the same: he throws some roses to the women in the front rows, begins to sing, and the rest is rapture. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $175. (Sisario)    * GUNS N' ROSES (Sunday) Only Michael Jackson inspires more morbid curiosity than Axl Rose, who has spent 12 years and a reported $13 million recording the next Guns N' Roses album with a steadily rotating cast of replacements, only occasionally coming up for air and paparazzi. But he has been a common sight lately -- showing up in public (which is unusual) and completing tours (even more unusual) -- fueling speculation that the album, ''Chinese Democracy,'' is ready for release soon. Patient fans are not holding their breath. At 8:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $39.50 to $89.50. (Sisario)    PADDY KEENAN (Tonight) Mr. Keenan, who plays uilleann pipes, comes from a family of itinerant Irish musicians, and has been one of Ireland's most influential traditional players since he helped start the Bothy Band in the 1970s. At 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950, nyu.edu/pages/irelandhouse; $15. (Jon Pareles)    * 'THE MUSIC OF BOB DYLAN' (Thursday) Paying tribute to Bob Dylan's genius is the easiest thing in the world: rock bands, folk singers, pop stars and everybody in between have been doing it for four and a half decades by simply singing his songs. But this starry benefit for the Music for Youth Foundation, which supports music education, has some intriguing angles: Natalie Merchant and Philip Glass; Clap Your Hands Say Yeah; Ramblin' Jack Elliott with the young singer-songwriter Jennifer O'Connor; Cat Power; Bob Mould; Allen Toussaint, the musical statesman from New Orleans; Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth; and Sandra Bernhard; not to mention Patti Smith, Rosanne Cash, Joan Osborne, Ryan Adams, Jay Farrar, Al Kooper, Warren Haynes and Medeski Martin & Wood. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 836-1853, musicforyouth.org; sold out except for V.I.P. packages. (Sisario)    'REGGAE CULTURE SALUTE 2006' (Tomorrow) The big reggae concert this fall should be relatively free of the controversy that has dogged so many other recent reggae shows: homophobia. With a tribute to Joseph Hill, the stalwart leader of the socially conscious group Culture (''Share the riches with the poor/Before they share the poverty with you''), who died in August at 57, and performances by Steel Pulse and the struggle-for-survival singer Luciano, this is a celebration of reggae's old-fashioned family values. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com or tsoproductions.com; $45 to $75. (Sisario)    SECRET MACHINES (Tonight and tomorrow night) The slowly unfolding, keyboard-driven compositions of Secret Machines have a stark, minimalist side; a glimmer of country; some pulsating; and a streak of Pink Floyd grandeur that swells to fill the room. There's a haunted undercurrent amid the pomp. At 9, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; sold out tonight, $27 tomorrow. (Pareles)    SIMON SHAHEEN AND QANTARA (Tomorrow) A virtuoso on the violin and the oud, Mr. Shaheen, a Palestinian who has long lived in New York, is a master of traditional styles who also likes to experiment. His band, Qantara, bends toward jazz, Western classical and Latin music. Also on the bill is Chiara Civello, a stylish young Italian jazz-cabaret singer. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)    STUART A. STAPLES (Tomorrow) Mr. Staples, the singer of the British band Tindersticks, has apparently taken his woeful, hesitating baritone and gone solo: he has moved to France and released two albums by himself. The latest, ''Leaving Songs'' (Beggars Banquet), has a not-so-subtle theme that comes through in songs like ''Goodbye to Old Friends,'' ''That Leaving Feeling'' and ''Already Gone.'' At 8 p.m., St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org; $30. (Sisario)    ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow night) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden)    JAMES TAYLOR (Thursday) The Mr. Nice Guy of baby-boom pop, James Taylor is all mild-mannered vocals and gentle guitar, turning memories of fire and rain into lullabies. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Pareles)    * VOXTROT (Monday and Tuesday) Like Morrissey and Ray Davies, Voxtrot's Ramesh Srivastava uses the small scale, tight script and jangly energy of the pop song to focus emotionally compelling character studies, and surrounds the antsy guitars with tasteful chamber arrangements. The combination has catapulted this Austin, Tex., band from the handmade-CD level to indie darlings in just a year or two. With Annual and Finally Punk on Monday, and Mahogany and the Ballet on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)    WITCHCRAFT (Wednesday) No, that's not Black Sabbath playing some long-lost track from 1971. It's Witchcraft, a Swedish band that even in a deeply retro metal culture stands out for a remarkable simulacrum of its heroes' knuckle-dragging fuzz-blues, even down to Magnus Pelander's helium-voiced Ozzy Osbourne. If Black Sabbath made it look easy, Witchcraft makes it look even easier. With Alana Amram and the Rough Gems, and Danava. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.

BILL BRUFORD'S EARTHWORKS (Tonight through Sunday night) Twenty years ago the drummer Bill Bruford, best known for his work with the progressive rock band King Crimson, formed Earthworks, a group that served both sides of the jazz-rock divide.

This engagement's substitute bassist, Victor Wooten, is likely to adapt easily to the group's hyperrhythmic style. (Through Nov. 12.)

(Chinen)    * KURT ELLING (Wednesday) Mr. Elling's sure-footed musicality and literary sensibility have made him one of the premier vocalists of our time. He comes with a flexible rhythm section -- the pianist Laurence Hobgood, the bassist Robert Amster and the drummer Willie Jones III -- along with a guest saxophonist, Bob Mintzer, and the Escher String Quartet. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44.

(Chinen)    ROY HARGROVE BIG BAND (Tonight through Monday night) The trumpeter Roy Hargrove, a paragon of small-group hard bop since the early '90s, has also intermittently led a big band over the years. Its current roster includes prime talent like the saxophonist Ron Blake, the trumpeter Maurice Brown and the pianist Stephen Scott. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $25.

At 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, between Greenwich and West Streets, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $30; students, $27.50. (Chinen)    DAVE HOLLAND QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Characterized by rhythmic assertiveness, tight counterpoint and an unconventional blend of timbres, this widely acclaimed ensemble features the bassist Dave Holland alongside the trombonist Robin Eubanks, the saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson and the drummer Nate Smith. At 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum.

At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA (Tonight) Mr. Mahanthappa is an alto saxophonist with quick reflexes and a razor-sharp tone, and he has lately pursued some conceptual and compositional ambitions. Here, leading something he calls the Sporty Brown Trio, he focuses more on pure interplay; his improvisational partners are the pianist Craig Taborn and the percussionist Gerry Hemingway. At 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    RUSSELL MALONE AND ROMERO LUBAMBO (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Malone and Mr. Lubambo are two of the finest guitarists working in the jazz idiom, with Mr. Malone's emphasis on post-bop and Mr. Lubambo's on modern Brazilian dialects. Camaraderie will probably eclipse competition in their encounter, which also involves the bassist Esperanza Spalding. (Through Nov. 12.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25.

E. M. Ensemble; and ''Far Side,'' a tribute to his former Art Ensemble of Chicago colleague Malachi Favors Maghostut, featuring the bassists Reggie Workman, Harrison Bankhead and Jaribu Shahid.

(Chinen)    JEREMY PELT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jeremy Pelt has an incisive trumpet style, evocative at times of Freddie Hubbard, but he is by no means a derivative talent. His working quartet, with the pianist Frank LoCrasto and the bassist Vicente Archer, welcomes the firepower of a guest drummer, Lenny White.

This season's stars include the guitarists Dorado Schmitt, Samson Schmitt and Tchavolo Schmitt -- Gypsy swing tends to be a family affair -- along with the accordionist Ludovic Beier and others. Special guests will include the trumpeter Dominick Farinacci (Tuesday) and the saxophonists James Carter (Wednesday) and Joel Frahm (Thursday). (Through Nov. 12.)

(Holland)    'The Elixir of Love' (Wednesday) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American version of Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elisir'' is a delightful opera, and that prevails whatever you think of the director's conceit (using the word advisedly). A new cast takes over this week, with the American tenor Leonardo Capalbo making his company debut as Nemorino, and Georgia Jarman, a fine soprano, as his Adina. Gerald Steichen will conduct. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)    'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In James Robinson's 1998 production for the New York City Opera, Engelbert Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel'' is updated to the 1890s, the time of its composition, and transplanted to New York. The woodsy cottage where the children live is a Lower East Side tenement. They run off into a snowy Central Park. And the witch's abode? A fancy Fifth Avenue mansion, of course. Jennifer Rivera and Jennifer Tiller share the role of Hansel; Jennifer Aylmer and Julianne Borg share the role of Gretel. Steven Mosteller conducts. The opera is performed in English. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125 tomorrow and Sunday at 1:30; $37 to $125 on Sunday at 5:30. (Anthony Tommasini)    * 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella's visually beautiful production, the abstract staging deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-size puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)    'RIGOLETTO' (Monday and Thursday) Three artists made their Metropolitan Opera debuts when the company recently revived Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production of ''Rigoletto.'' On opening night on Oct. 25, each artist showed promise but performed unevenly. The tenor Joseph Calleja was an expressive and youthful though vocally tentative Duke of Mantua. The coloratura soprano Ekaterina Siurina as Gilda was almost his opposite: technically exquisite, with a sweet and sizable voice, but emotionally cautious. Friedrich Haider conducted an animated performance that sometimes turned driven. The veteran baritone Juan Pons was the powerful, if blustery, Rigoletto. (Olga Makarina fills in for Ms. Siurina on Thursday.) Monday at 8 and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The news was supposed to be that Andrea Gruber was singing her first Tosca, decked out in the stage jewelry Swarovski created for Callas's first Met Tosca in 1956. The real news on opening night on Saturday turned out to be the debut of the conductor Nicola Luisotti, who actually conducted this piece as if it mattered. José Cura was a bad-boy Cavaradossi who hid his own light under an air of nonchalance, and whose climaxes seemed to be torn out of him against his will (it worked for everything but ''E lucevan''); James Morris was animated into a semblance of flexibility by all the excitement. Ms. Gruber had to cancel on opening night because of illness, but plans to sing the rest of her scheduled performances. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 tickets remaining tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Tuesday. (Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and its programs are growing more varied. Tonight the cellist Leslie Parnas and the pianist Doris Stevenson collaborate on sonatas by Britten, Chopin and Shostakovich. Ms. Stevenson is joined by Mark Peskanov, the violinist, and Jeffrey Solow, the cellist, for the Mendelssohn C minor Trio (Op. 66) tomorrow and Sunday, in a program that also includes the Brahms Violin Sonata No. 1 and Barber's rich but too infrequently heard Cello Sonata. And on Thursday Ariadne Daskalakis, a violinist, and Roglit Ishay, a pianist, take over for an adventurous program of works by Lutoslawski, Raff, Fauré and Mozart. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday only. (Allan Kozinn)    * BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday night) Classical music is a field given to hyperbole, so the statement that this is one of Germany's best orchestras, led by one of the world's best conductors, might sound like empty hype. But it's true. As if to underline it, Mariss Jansons, music director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, is showcasing three of the classical world's most notable stars: Karita Mattila sings ''Four Last Songs'' tonight; the eccentric Gidon Kremer plays Bartok's First Violin Concerto tomorrow; and the gifted but controversial pianist Lang Lang makes a bid at seriousness by appearing with the orchestra on Sunday in Beethoven's First Piano Concerto. The orchestra will also play symphonies by Shostakovich (the Sixth), Sibelius (the Second), and Beethoven (the Seventh). At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98. (Midgette)    YEFIM BRONFMAN, GIL SHAHAM AND LYNN HARRELL (Sunday) Chamber collaborations by star soloists often have an ad hoc quality, a sense that coming together to make music is rewarding for the musicians but not always so enlightening for listeners. Whether that will be the case here remains to be seen, but Mr. Bronfman's piano playing, Mr. Shaham's approach to the violin and Mr. Harrell's work on the cello have several qualities in common, most crucially warmth of tone and attention to detail. They are performing Mozart's Piano Trio in C (K. 548), Shostakovich's Piano Trio No. 2 in E minor (Op. 67) and Schubert's Piano Trio in E flat (D. 929). At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $82. (Kozinn)    'ELLIOTT CARTER: TIME PRESENT' (Tomorrow) They call it a docu-concert: an evening devoted to Mr. Carter, the 97-year-old composer, that mingles live performance and excerpts from films created by Frank Scheffer. The full-length documentary ''A Labyrinth of Time'' will be shown in the afternoon. In the evening, performances of Mr. Carter's music by Fred Sherry, Tara Helen O'Connor, Charles Neidich and others alternate with film excerpts, including the world premiere of a short film Mr. Scheffer made about Mr. Carter's cello concerto. Film screening at 4:30 p.m., performances at 8 p.m., Roy and Nina Titus Theaters, Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10; $8 for 65+; $6 for students. (Midgette)    * 'THE CAVE' (Tonight and tomorrow night) This collaboration between the composer Steve Reich and the video artist Beryl Korot explores Jewish, Muslim and Christian perspectives on the Cave of Machpelah, in Hebron, where Abraham and Sarah are buried. Tensions have run high at the site for centuries, but when Mr. Reich and Ms. Korot, who are married, wrote the work in 1993, they envisioned its more peaceful potential: Abraham's sons, Isaac and Ishmael (the fathers of the Jews and Arabs, respectively), had, after all, come together to bury their father at the site. Ms. Korot's video interviews with Israelis, Palestinians and Americans offer fascinating glimpses of divergent beliefs, and here as in other Reich scores, the vocal inflections of the speakers yield ample melodic and rhythmic material. Mr. Reich and his ensemble perform the work, with Brad Lubman conducting. At 8, John Jay College Theater, 899 10th Avenue, at 59th Street, Clinton, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $45. (Kozinn)    EMMANUEL CEYSSON (Monday) Mr. Ceysson, a 22-year-old harpist, makes his New York debut playing Bach's French Suite No. 3 in B minor, Fauré's ''Châtelaine en sa tour,'' Marius Constant's ''Harpalycé,'' Marcel Grandjany's Rhapsody for Harp and String Quartet, Henriette Renié's ''Ballade Fantastique,'' the premiere of Benjamin C. S. Boyle's ''Suite Sylvanesque'' and Ravel's Introduction and Allegro for harp, string quartet, flute and clarinet. Guest artists are Marya Martin, a flutist; Jose Franch-Ballester, a clarinetist; and the Jupiter String Quartet. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 and $35. (Vivien Schweitzer)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) A program of serious Central European music led by the equally serious American composer Leon Kirchner. The other music by Webern, Korngold and Brahms is for piano (one and two hands), strings and clarinet. At 5 p.m. on Sunday and 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Holland)    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow and Sunday) This period-instrument ensemble, led by Frederick Renz, offers a program called ''The King's Musick: Henry VIII and the Tudor Court, Circa 1500.'' The performance consists of pieces from ''Henry VIII's Song Book,'' which includes the king's own compositions, part songs, instrumental consorts and other tidbits from composers of his court and the Chapel Royal. The group will play selections for singers and instruments including sackbuts, lutes and recorders. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.; Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330, earlymusicny.org; $40. (Schweitzer)    FRETWORK (Tomorrow) This viol consort is making its Miller Theater debut with ''Jewish Musicians at the Tudor Court,'' featuring music by Bassano, Lupo, van Wilder, Duarte and Gough. The program is inspired by the recent research of Roger Prior, a musicologist who says the majority of the instrumentalists in the Tudor royal household were Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had settled in Italy after 1492 and were then recruited by Henry VIII. At 8, Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $21 for students. (Schweitzer)    GLENN GOULD FILMS (Tomorrow) ''Glenn Gould Unveiled,'' Lincoln Center's retrospective about the enigmatic Canadian pianist, continues with two black-and-white films made in 1959. ''Off the Record'' and ''On the Record'' depict Mr. Gould's private and public lives, respectively; ''On the Record'' includes clips of him at a recording session in Manhattan, playing the Italian Concerto. Later tomorrow, an interview with Humphrey Burton will be shown, which includes Mr. Gould performing excerpts from Strauss's ''Metamorphosen,'' ''Three Ophelia Songs'' and Burleske in D minor for piano and orchestra. At 2 and 4 p.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $15. (Schweitzer)    HÉLÈNE GRIMAUD (Wednesday) This French pianist, also an author and the founder of the Wolf Conservation Center, begins her recital with Busoni's transcription of the Bach Chaconne. It will also include Chopin's Berceuse in D flat and Barcarolle in F sharp, and Brahms's Two Rhapsodies (Op. 79). At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $76. (Kozinn)    JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Wednesday) Those old enough to remember this quartet as a pack of cutting-edge youngsters will be shocked that it is celebrating 60 years of existence, and is still playing the music that made it famous, namely Bartok's six String Quartets. (Through Nov. 10.) At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)    * LYRIC CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF NEW YORK (Wednesday) For the second program of its ninth season, this music society presents the dynamic, technically nimble American violinist Timothy Fain, a 1999 winner of the Young Concert Artists Auditions and a performer with a burgeoning career. He plays in recital with the pianist Richard Bishop. The program includes a premiere by Randall Woolf and a recent work by Kevin Puts, as well as music by Mendelssohn, Mozart, Chausson and Saint-Saëns. At 7:30 p.m., Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, lyricny.org; $45. (Tommasini)    ZUKERMAN CHAMBERPLAYERS  (Sunday) This group was formed three years ago when Pinchas Zukerman, the violinist and music director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, teamed up with four young protégés: Amanda Forsyth, a cellist (and his wife); Jethro Marks and Ashan Pillai, both violists; and Jessica Linnebach, a violinist. On Sunday the ensemble plays Mozart's String Quintet in G minor (K. 516) and Brahms's String Quintet No. 2 in G (Op. 111.) F. Murray Abraham, who played Antonio Salieri in the film ''Amadeus,'' kicks off the proceedings by performing Salieri's soliloquy on Mozart's genius. At 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

(Jennifer Dunning)    * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow) The company's more venturesome fall season -- compared with the parade of evening-length story ballets at the Metropolitan Opera House in the late spring and early summer -- ends with three performances offering its typical mixed repertory; all three should give pleasure. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, abt.org; $26 to $93.

(Dunning)    LAWRENCE GOLDHUBER (Tonight through Sunday) O.K., O.K., we know this is billed as ''theater,'' that dull alternative art form. But Mr. Goldhuber has many dance fans, so we thought we'd let you know he's performing ''SWELL(ing) Relatives,'' an excursion into the world of a man who must hold down his floating possessions with 1,000 potatoes. Valeria Vasilevski is the director. (Through Nov. 12.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 10, Sunday at 5:30 p.m., La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * Bronx Museum of the Arts, 'Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sunshower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)    Brooklyn Museum: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Roberta Smith)    * Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal peity. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,'  through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Grace Glueck)    Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Americans in Paris: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7719, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    The Met: 'Coaxing the Spirits to Dance,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)    MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them François Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)    * Museum of modern art: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    NEWARK MUSEUM, the Jewish Museum: 'Masters of American Comics,' through Jan. 28. Organized by the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it made a splash, this show has come east, cut in size and split between the far-flung Newark and Jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. Art Spiegelman, one of the masters who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work. Still, the show shouldn't be missed. It spotlights artists like Chris Ware and Gary Panter, amazing state-of-the-art talents and endearing in the tradition of all those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their rooms when other kids wouldn't play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, ''I told you so.'' Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, (973) 596-6550, newarkmuseum.org; and the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir: High Plane,' through May 7. Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir's ''High Plane V,'' a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)    The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Chelsea    Robert Colescott: 'A Survey of Paintings' It's good to have Robert Colescott back in town for his first New York solo show here since 2000. Now 81, Mr. Colescott has been dealing in a slap-in-the-face way with race, class, sex and American life for nearly 40 years. His early pictures, like ''George Washington Carver Crossing the Delaware'' (1975), were riffs on museum classics; the five paintings from the 1990s in this mini-survey are a lot harder to pin down. They're richly and expressively painted; they don't hinge on a joke or a clear-cut contrast between good and bad, though they tend to feel bad, in a bad-dream way, and sick-joke funny. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, through Nov. 11. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    Anant Joshi Cities in Asia are changing fast. They're going up and coming down at about equal speed. Urban culture, flooded with global goods and media, is changing too. Inevitably, such transformations have a big impact on art, and they are the subjects of new work by Anant Joshi, who lives and work in Mumbai. Paintings show a vision of the city modeled on commercial packing materials. Small sculptures, monuments to consumerist chaos, are assembled from hundreds of miniature toys, all made in China. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com, through Nov. 18. (Cotter)    Last Chance    TAUBA AUERBACH: 'YES AND NOT YES' Operating in the gap between Conceptual Art, abstraction and graphic design, this San Francisco artist makes large ink drawings based on naval semaphore, the binary language of digital technology, the interior shapes of capital letters and much else. The results might be called abstraction by other means and are rife with hidden meanings, arcane facts and other conundrums, especially if the gallery's description sheet is studied. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * Karen Kilimnik This sharp, witty, low-key show is spun around a Napoleonic theme, with a full-scale battle tent sitting in the gallery and paintings of Géricaultian steeds and soldiers inside and out. But any incipient Romanticism is cut with impurities -- walk-ons from Hollywood, refugees from Allure magazine -- as if to keep everything off-balance and confused. Although Ms. Kilimnik has a reputation as a celebrity fantasist, she's a conceptual artist with a cool, watchful, resistant eye. Everyone agrees that full recognition of her accomplishment and influence is long overdue. May it begin here. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    Michaela Meise This ultra-space show by the Berlin-based artist Michaela Meise is filled with oblique references to the city and its history of undergrounds and outsiders. There are pictures from the film ''Hair,'' shot in Central Park; excavation pictures of the African Burial Ground in Lower Manhattan; and one of the British composer Benjamin Britten, who lived in New York as a pacifist during World War II. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, eighth floor, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    KEN PRICE: 'SCULPTURE AND DRAWINGS, 1962-2006' The largest New York exhibition yet devoted to Mr. Price's polymorphous ceramic sculptures reviews four decades of progress, offers an array of powerful new small pieces and introduces his first attempt at something bigger. It invites us to contemplate his transubstantiation of Los Angeles finish fetish and the relationship of his jewel-like surfaces to the random vastness of Jackson Pollock's drip paintings. When will a New York museum give this amazing artist the retrospective he deserves? Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com; closes tomorrow.
