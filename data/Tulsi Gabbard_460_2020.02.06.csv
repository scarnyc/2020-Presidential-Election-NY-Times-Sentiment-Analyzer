Broadway    +'BROOKLYN BOY' One of the mortifications of middle age is being forced to admit the truth in those extra-mossy clichés that you mock when you are young and arrogant. The past always catches up with you; blood is thicker than water; be careful what you wish for. These are among the stale-but-true bromides that are acknowledged by the title character in Donald Margulies's sincere but doggedly unsurprising new play about the midlife crisis of a suddenly successful novelist (Adam Arkin). While this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: make the familiar seem fresh. Polly Draper and Ari Graynor stand out in an excellent cast, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan (2:20). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $79.  BEN BRANTLEY    +'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to Mr. Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.  BRANTLEY    +'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Even those who believe that everything on this planet has a purpose may at first have trouble justifying the existence of ''Good Vibrations,'' the singing headache that manages to purge all catchiness from the surpassingly catchy hits of the Beach Boys. But audience members strong enough to sit through this rickety jukebox of a show will discover that the production, directed and choreographed by John Carrafa, does have a reason to be. ''Good Vibrations'' sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good. As the show's washboard-stomached performers smile, wriggle and squeak with the desperation of wet young things hung out to dry, you feel their pain. It is unlikely, however, to be more acute than yours (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $76 to $101; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets are available at the box office on the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    +'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'') shows a gift for fresh, comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    +'BELFAST BLUES' The ''Belfast Blues'' of Geraldine Hughes's solo show aren't the kind you'd expect. Yes, the ''troubles'' between Roman Catholics and Protestants that have roiled Northern Ireland for decades do cast an emotional shadow over this heartfelt and funny if unexceptional stage memoir, descriptively subtitled ''one wee girl's story about family, war, Jesus and Hollywood.'' But Ms. Hughes's title more directly refers to her big, inquisitive and exceptionally expressive eyes, which helped secure that wee girl a ticket to a happier life. ''Belfast Blues,'' which recounts her experience growing up amid poverty and violence in Belfast in the 1970's and 80's, does not bring any groundbreaking insights to familiar territory. But Ms. Hughes is a bright, inviting presence, and the surprising agent of her deliverance from the troubled atmosphere of her youth gives the show a modestly refreshing twist (1:25). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $45; a limited number of $20 student rush tickets are available at the box office one hour before the performance.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' In this stunningly powerful production, an intriguing balance arises between Lopakhin, the bourgeois former serf, and the aristocratic family that owns the cherry orchard and whose fortunes are all but dried up. The landowner Lyubov Ranevskaya (Petronia Paley), returning penniless from her life abroad, is as elegant as she is self-delusional. Against her beauty and her dignity, Lopakhin (Wendell Pierce), the archetype of the small-minded arriviste, is a hard man to like. But this production brings out their shared past in subtle but forceful gestures that complicate the audience's sympathies (2:00). Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25.  CAMPBELL ROBERTSON    'COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW' Entertainment in abundance radiates from the Peccadillo Theater Company's new production of the old Elmer Rice drama ''Counsellor-at-Law.'' Starring the Tony Award-winning John Rubinstein, ''Counsellor-at-Law'' is a drama that throbs with New York life and brims with touchstones of another time, like ''George White's Scandals'' and the Court of General Sessions. But it also retains relevance to ambition and success in the 21st century. It has a hero worth rooting for, a healthy dose of sacred and profane love, some sharp jabs at class difference, villains who merit a hearty hiss and plenty of New York attitude and humor (2:45). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $55; $20 student rush tickets available at the box office 15 minutes before the performance.  LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    +'SABINA' Once a forgotten ghost in the annals of psychoanalysis, Sabina Spielrein is proving to have surprising staying power. A patient of Carl Jung and an acquaintance of Sigmund Freud who ultimately became a psychoanalyst herself, Spielrein has a history that has provided material for two movies and two plays. The first of these was Willy Holtzman's ''Sabina,'' first produced by Primary Stages in 1996 and now in revival as part of the company's 20th-anniversary season. The new production, directed by Ethan McSweeny, is hampered by an unsatisfactory performance from Marin Ireland in the title role. But the history of Spielrein's relationships with the founder of psychoanalysis and his protégé turned apostate is nonetheless engrossing. It provides a provocative window into the much-studied relationship between Freud and Jung. Peter Strauss gives an admirably understated performance as a paternalistic Freud, and Victor Slezak, as Jung, gives persuasive dramatic life to a now-mythic figure. (2:15). Primary Stages, at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays though Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.  PHOEBE HOBAN    +'SLEEPING BEAUTY' Trust a British ''Sleeping Beauty'' to pivot on a fairy's flatulence. Yes, that surefire laugh trigger in old Blighty plays an unexpectedly large role in Rufus Norris's murky new version of the familiar fairy tale for the Young Vic Theater Company. Mr. Norris, a talented young British director whose Broadway-bound production of ''Festen'' snapped up many London theater awards, isn't interested in pretty pictures. His vigorously staged, grotesquely comic ''Sleeping Beauty,'' which unfolds in smoky darkness beneath a queasy yellow moon, is entirely in tune with the current vogue for teasing out thickets of disturbing subtext in children's literature. The production's eccentric designs accentuate the predominantly eerie air (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7; tomorrow and Sunday at 1 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $10, $20 and $30.  ISHERWOOD    +'TEXAS HOMOS' Often in theater, the provocativeness of a play's title correlates with quality, and not in a good way. But ''Texas Homos'' is a pleasant exception. The title's tone does serve a purpose: it signals that the language in this show is far filthier than some theatergoers might care for, but the play is artfully constructed and convincingly acted, especially by Reed Birney and Richard Bekins in the central roles. Cecil (Mr. Birney) and Jim Bob (Mr. Bekins) have been caught engaging in gay sex in a police sting at a public restroom in Tyler, Tex. Since one is the town doctor and the other a preacher, and since both have wives and children, this creates more than a few problems. ''Texas Homos'' is not really about gay men at all. It is about everyone who has a secret life, and the nightmare that envelops such people once they are discovered. Mr. Birney's portrait of desperation and defiance feels dead on, and so does Mr. Bekins's of resignation and surrender (2:00). June Havoc Theater, Abingdon Theater Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $25.  NEIL GENZLINGER    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as standup existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, hereby reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Standup-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno might be called a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation. Let's try that again, minus the conditional: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45.  ISHERWOOD    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' This lovably inconsequential, entirely adorable new musical brings to the stage the culture's current mania for celebrating that most revered of American virtues, the will to victory. A mock spelling bee, it pokes serious fun at its twitchy tween contestants -- in the loopy spirit of the movies ''Waiting for Guffman'' and ''Best in Show'' -- but also pays affectionate tribute to these quirky young spelling titans. William Finn's nimble, upbeat score provides the emotional underpinning for Rachel Sheinkin's more satirical -- indeed often riotously funny -- book. The director James Lapine, Mr. Finn's collaborator on ''Falsettos,'' is also in impeccable form, managing to transform into virtues two of the theater's most reliable pitfalls, namely audience participation and the usually ghastly conceit of adult actors' playing kids (1:45). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $75.  ISHERWOOD    'WASTED (THE MYSTERY/HISTORY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW IT GOT THAT WAY)' In ''Wasted,'' the Irondale Ensemble Project tries to answer a very difficult question: How do you make a play about the history of the public school system in American without being terribly boring? While they came up with a number of solutions, none were satisfactory. History is reduced to good guys and bad guys, who both talk in slogans: should school teach kids to think for themselves or prepare them for the workforce? The decline of the school system is told simply as a story of dark conspiracies motivated by corporate greed. In the end, you get the sense that this show is made by people who have spent little time reflecting on the ideas of the other side (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $25; $15 for seniors, students and New York City Public School teachers; on Thursdays pay what you can afford.  JASON ZINOMAN    Off Off Broadway    'THE CONFESSIONS OF PUNCH AND JUDY' The anarchist Punch and his wife, Judy, have been beating each other senseless for centuries, but while the famously warring married couple is usually performed by puppets, two real-life actors do the quarreling in ''The Confessions of Punch and Judy,'' a rigorously performed modern update with a surplus of energy and a deficit of direction. Ker Wells and Tannis Kowalchuk, who wrote the drama with the director Raymond Bobgan, play the pair in this pedestrian production, which mixes mime, ballroom dance, first-person monologues, puppetry and naturalistic acting. The play has few original thematic or design ideas and never reinvents the stock characters in an interesting way. In the end, it has no insight that you won't learn later this year in the revival of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Sundays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $15.  ZINOMAN    'DAY OF RECKONING' This play about the anarchist and labor reformer Lucy Parsons is unevenly paced and clumsily staged, but it has this saving grace: unlike some other theatrical efforts associated with Black History Month, it is not shallow hero worship. Parsons was a decidedly flawed hero, and Melody Cooper, the playwright, leaves those flaws in plain sight. As a young woman, Parsons, played by Ms. Cooper, called herself Lucy Gonzalez and tried to pass as Mexican and American Indian, chafing at any suggestion that she was black. And in her militant-labor phase, with her white husband, Albert, she exhorted followers, ''Learn to use explosives.'' When the Parsonses' domestic bliss is shattered by the Haymarket Riot of 1886, Lucy loses her bearings, and her son pays an appalling price. Ms. Cooper's recounting of this fascinating life could benefit from a large infusion of understatement, but still, Parsons's story is one that deserves to be told, especially at a time when those with radical ideas are again under intense scrutiny (1:50). All Stars Project's Performing Arts and Education Center, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)941-1234. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $15.  GENZLINGER    'THE FLID SHOW' With the drug Vioxx making headlines because of its recent recall over adverse side effects, Richard Willett's play ''The Flid Show'' gains an unsettling topicality. The play traces the history of Thalidomide, the sleeping pill widely distributed in Europe in the late 1950's and early 60's that caused birth defects when taken by pregnant women. Mat Fraser, a seasoned and charismatic British actor who was himself a ''Thalidomide baby,'' stars as Duncan, a lounge singer coming to grips with the anger and resentment fueled by his lifelong struggles. In Mr. Willett's fanciful dramatic scheme -- borrowed from a certain Dickens holiday favorite, as he acknowledges -- Duncan's psychological scars are healed by a series of ghostly visitors who sweep him through time and space. The documentary aspects of the play are absorbing and often poignant (particularly Amy Staats' monologue as a bereaved Belgian mother), but Duncan's personal story, centering on his rocky romance with a doctor and a reconciliation, in spirit at least, with his dead mother, is crudely drawn and clichéd. The director Eliza Beckwith's production is also on the clunky side, with most of the acting not up to the standard set by Mr. Fraser in the central role (2:15). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; $30 for a special benefit performance on Feb. 24.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    +'THE HOUSE OF BERNARDA ALBA' The role of Bernarda Alba has not changed in this production: she is still the tyrannical widowed mother of five daughters who are burning to free themselves from her stifling house. But here it's Poncia (Joanne Camp), the maid, who sets the tone. Poncia's world-weariness instills the play with an earthy, prosaic feel rather than a poetic one. Gone is the passion, and gone, too, is the terror when the tragic consequences of Bernarda's tyranny are revealed. Gone, in other words, is the heat that permeates the play. In its place is a comfy warmth, a fireside instead of an inferno (1:45). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50 for tomorrow evening and Sunday; matinee tomorrow, $40.  ROBERTSON    *'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege, in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' Directed by James Cameron and Steven Quale. (G, 48 minutes). When the director James Cameron proclaimed himself ''king of the world'' on winning the Oscar for ''Titanic,'' who knew that he also had designs on the rest of the solar system? His newest film, ''Aliens of the Deep,'' is a grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy that begins on our planet's ocean floor and ends many miles under the ice crust that covers Europa, the second moon of Jupiter. The movie's sneaky transition from undersea documentary to speculative fantasy of a journey yet to be undertaken is so seamless that you could easily mistake the last portion of the film for the record of an actual space voyage. Mr. Cameron's theory, supported by astrobiologists, is that the life forms found at the deepest levels of the ocean where no light from the sun penetrates may hold clues to the nature of possible life in outer space. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'ASSISTED LIVING' Starring Michael Bonsignore and Maggie Riley. Directed by Elliot Greenebaum. (No rating, 77 minutes). As nursing homes go, Meadow View, the site of this hard-headed comedy that feels like a documentary, is a far cry from the hellholes we sometimes read about, where the elderly are dumped and treated like prisoners. The rooms are clean and the staff efficient. Life there is viewed through the institution's scruffy 27-year-old janitor (Mr. Bonsignore) who regularly sneaks off to smoke pot, is careless about punctuality, and plays affectionate pranks on the residents to relieve his boredom. The wisp of a plot follows Todd's relationship with a patient (Ms. Riley) suffering from early Alzheimer's disease. ''Assisted Living'' may be a comedy, but its images of physical frailty are inescapably unsettling.  HOLDEN    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BOOGEYMAN' Starring Barry Watson. Directed by Stephen Kay (PG-13, 86 minutes). There are a lot of close-ups of doorknobs and water faucets in Mr. Kay's would-be horror film. There is a supernaturally speedy killing accomplished with heavy-duty plastic wrap. There is frequent whooshing and rapid camera movement. Despite all of that, it isn't scary. Mr. Watson, of ''Seventh Heaven,'' plays Tim, a grown man who has been afraid of the boogeyman ever since he was 8, when something creepy sucked his father into a closet and out of this life. After his mother's death, Tim vows to spend a night in his childhood home to allay his fears, but, sure enough, the boogeyman is back and after him and everyone he cares about (well, an uncle and two girlfriends). The house is very creaky; so is the movie.  ANITA GATES    'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, not related to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.  A.O. SCOTT    *'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes). In German and Turkish, with English subtitles. Love doesn't just hurt in the jagged German romance ''Head-On''; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Mr. Unel) and Sibel (Ms. Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about these two perfectly imperfect beings.  DARGIS    'HIDE AND SEEK' Starring Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen, Elisabeth Shue, Amy Irving, Dylan Baker and Melissa Leo. Directed by John Polson. (R, 105 minutes). In the downbeat, sufficiently unsettling ''Hide and Seek,'' Mr. De Niro plays a New York City shrink, David, who's married to a somnolent type (Ms. Irving), whose love for their daughter, Emily (Ms. Fanning), can't disguise her unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the family, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse, as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story; then it pours. One of the most gifted child actors around, Ms. Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence; even when you don't believe the setup, you buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to this horror-thriller hybrid, which was written by Ari Schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors.  DARGIS    *'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller, based on fact, performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage that it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a hundred-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type that Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.  DARGIS    'LOST EMBRACE' Starring Daniel Hendler. Directed by Daniel Burman (not rated, 100 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). Set in a shabby Buenos Aires shopping mall, this antic, melancholy comedy gives a Latin American twist to a story of young, male Jewish identity crisis that will be familiar to fans of Philip Roth, Neil Simon and Woody Allen. Ariel (the fast-moving, nervous-looking Mr. Hendler) is a young man in a hurry, without much of a sense of direction. He carries on an anxious affair with an older woman, pines for his former girlfriend, and fantasizes about emigrating to Poland, from which his family fled two generations before. Mostly, though, he is haunted by the absence of his father, Elias, who abandoned him as a baby to go to Israel to fight in the 1973 war. The film, while busy and diffuse, is also touching and funny, and its modesty and haphazardness are among its charms.  SCOTT    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).  DARGIS    *'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent interpretation from Mr. Radford and a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velázquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    *'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004.  SCOTT    *'NOBODY KNOWS' Starring Yuya Yagira. . Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (PG-13, 141 minutes; in Japanese, with English subtitles). Based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in a small Tokyo apartment, Mr. Kore-eda's fourth film is at once harrowing and tender, an urban horror story with overtones of fairy tale. Restricting himself to the children's point of view, the director creates an almost unbearable sense of dread in the audience; you can't help suspecting that, at every moment, something terrible is about to happen. But at the same time, because the children themselves do not perceive the full terribleness of their situation, the terror is mitigated by a sense of wonder and adventure. The keys to this meticulous and deeply humane film are Mr. Kore-eda's deft camera sense and the remarkable performance of the 12-year-old Mr. Yagira as Akira, the oldest of the four siblings, who must somehow preserve his own innocence while protecting his more vulnerable brother and sisters.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou, Gaspard Ulliel, Jean-Pierre Becker, Dominique Bettenfeld, Clovis Cornillac and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet possesses a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'THE WEDDING DATE' Starring Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Clare Kilner. (PG-13, 90 minutes). Either Ms. Kilner or Dana Fox, her screenwriter, must have adored ''Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' because their new romantic comedy struggles from beginning to end to capture that earlier film's charm and ebullience. Their efforts are largely unsuccessful. Ms. Messing stars as Kat Ellis, a New Yorker en route to London for her younger half-sister's wedding. Since there is no man in Kat's life, she turns to the classified ads for male escorts. In a fantasy worthy of ''Pretty Woman,'' the male prostitute she hires turns out to be a hunk (Mr. Mulroney) with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from Brown. Both stars are highly appealing, despite a shaky script with aphorisms that don't quite deliver. After rowdy parties in London, everyone heads for the glorious English countryside for family-bonding activities. ''The Wedding Date'' proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old pop-music hit in the background. What charms it does have would be far more enjoyable if the movie weren't so in love with its own supposed cuteness.  GATES.    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    APOLLO SUNSHINE, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. The tunefulness of folk-rock and the Beatles goes joyously off the rails in the songs of this Boston band, which tends to get more raucously enthusiastic somewhere around the second verse. Tonight at 9, with Falcon and Brian Bonz opening; admission is $10.  JON PARELES    *NEKO CASE, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. In one of her songs, Neko Case declares, ''I'm a dying breed who still believes, haunted by American dreams.'' Her songs look back to the era when country music addressed death, sin and heartbreak. She sings honky-tonk and torch songs in a voice that's intimate with tragedy and desire. Sunday and Monday nights at 8, with the Sadies sharing the bill; tickets are $20, $18 in advance.  PARELES    C.J. CHENIER, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155. C.J. Chenier, the son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, picked up his late father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. Sunday afternoon as part of the Let's Zydeco series, with dance lessons at 1:30 and music at 2; admission is $22.  PARELES    SANDRA COLLINS, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)807-7780. Ms. Collins tends toward clean, energetic progressive-house tracks, letting misty atmospherics and grand synthesizers glide over precise rhythm tracks. Tomorrow night after 10, with Pete Tong, Eyal Hen and Eddie Lee; admission is $30.  KELEFA SANNEH    *BO DIDDLEY/GENYA RAVAN, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, (212) 997-4144. When Bo Diddley plays his namesake beat and growls the metaphysical boasts of ''Who Do You Love,'' it's easy to hear the fire and syncopation that made him a rock pioneer. Behind them is a profound education in the blues. Genya Ravan, who sang with the band Ten Wheel Drive and was a pioneering female rock producer, opens the show. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 tomorrow.  PARELES    *THOMAS FEHLMAN, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Mr. Fehlman, a German producer, has been tinkering with electronic beats since the 1980's. Last year he released ''Lowflow'' (Plug Research), a warm CD full of minimalist pulses and languid breakbeats. Tonight at midnight; admission is $5.  SANNEH    *HEART & SOUL VALENTINE'S CONCERT, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)247-0200. This is the kind of concert where the audience seems likely to outperform the performers. Not that there's anything wrong with the veteran R&B acts scheduled to appear. The lineup includes Harold Melvin's Blue Notes, Ted Mills (formerly of Blue Magic), Meli'sa Morgan and, perhaps best of all, Staten Island's Force M.D.'s, who were combining smooth R&B with bumpy hip-hop long before it was as popular (or, as the members probably know all too well, as lucrative) as it is today. Still the real thrill will probably be the crowd full of quiet men and notably unquiet women, clutching roses and drinks and -- if the singers are doing their job right -- one another. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $45, and you might as well obey the fliers and ''dress to impress.''  SANNEH    *NORMAN JAY, APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 414-4245. One of Britain's most popular D.J.'s comes to this cozy (that's a euphemism) nightclub in support of ''Good Times 4'' (Resist), a laid-back double-disc compilation put together by Norman Jay and his brother, Joey Jay. Expect a night of elegant funk, in the broadest sense -- the compilation includes appearances by everyone from the reggae act Zap Pow to the big band overseen by the British electronica producer Matthew Herbert. Tomorrow night after 10, with Citizen Kane; tickets are $8.  SANNEH    KOOL KEITH, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Kool Keith is hip-hop's definition of multiple personality syndrome, from his days with the Ultramagnetic M.C.'s to more recent metamorphoses into Dr. Octagon and Reverand Tom. Depending on his chosen role, he could be rapping comedy, science or smut. Tonight at 11; tickets are $20.  PARELES    KITKA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155. The drones, dissonances and eerie beauty of Eastern European women's vocal music are the province of Kitka, which has been singing them since 1979. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $20.  PARELES    *JENS LEKMAN/THE IMPOSSIBLE SHAPES/PARKER & LILY/THE SILENT LEAGUE, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. Pop gets twisted in highly personal ways on this quadruple bill. Jens Lekman, a Swedish songwriter whose lyrics are in English, writes wistful ditties that can be wry or depressive. The Impossible Shapes look back to the psychedelically warped pop of the late 1960's, while Parker & Lily sing slowly and quietly about the wreckage of romance in reverberant arrangements. Brian Wilson's legacy shimmers through the songs of the Silent League, which uses a handful of musicians to create grandly expansive orchestral pop. Tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $10.  PARELES    LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO QUEEN: NO TIME FOR LOSERS, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212)533-2680. Joe McGinty and his coterie of songwriting connoisseurs first applied themselves to the mixture of hard-rock grandiosity and campy arrogance that was Queen five years ago. They're back at it, with ingenious ways to reinterpret the multitracked splendors of songs like ''Bohemian Rhapsody.'' Tonight at 8; admission is $25. Tomorrow night at 7, admission is $25; tomorrow night at 10:30, admission is $20.  PARELES    *ENRIQUE MORENTE/TOMATITO, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)247-7800. This concert brings together two musicians who combine flamenco's austere tradition of volatile, smoldering passion with the urge to reinvent it. Enrique Morente is a singer who has reached back to old styles and also looked outside the tradition for forms and texts, from a flamenco Mass to rock fusions. This time, he will be in a more traditional format, collaborating with the remarkable guitarist Tomatito, whose improvising vocabulary includes both the deepest flamenco and the harmonies of jazz. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $22 to $69.  PARELES    ERICK MORILLO, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. This veteran house producer may still be best known for producing the huge 1993 hit ''I Like to Move It,'' but since then he's established himself as one of New York's most popular D.J.'s, known for raucous, clattering sets that sometimes gesture toward his love of Latin music. This party celebrates his new release, a four-disc set called ''The 2 Sides of My World'' (Subliminal), which includes both original productions (one track, ''Dance I Said,'' features P. Diddy) and D.J. mixes. Tonight after 10; tickets are $30 in advance, more at the door.  SANNEH    JOHNNY PACHECO/LA SONORA PONCEÑA/TITO ROJAS, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, (212) 239-2672. The flutist and bandleader Johnny Pacheco was born in the Dominican Republic but fell in love early with Afro-Cuban music. He has been a prime mover in New York Latin music since the 1960's, when he helped start Fania Records; he went on to lead the Fania All-Stars, the band that defined New York salsa. La Sonora Ponceña has been one of the cornerstones of Puerto Rican salsa since it was founded in 1954. Its arrangements are at once transparent and propulsive, with pinpoint horns, percussion and keyboard behind ardent vocals; they have urged more than one generation of dancers into motion. Tito Rojas has been one of the leading Puerto Rican salsa singers since the 1980's, making hits with both ballads and dance tunes. Tomorrow night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.; admission is $25.  PARELES    *SMOKEY AND MIHO/CHOCOLATE GENIUS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Miho Hatori sang and wrote songs for the funk-rap-lounge band Cibo Matto; Smokey Hormel has played guitar with Tom Waits and Beck. Leading a band, they delve into -- what else? -- Brazilian music. They're joined for this show, a benefit for Tonic, by the percussionist Cyro Baptista and the drummer Billy Martin from Medeski, Martin and Wood. Marc Anthony Thompson, aka Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs about goodbyes, from doomed romances to senile parents. With his husky voice and the backup of Marc Ribot on guitar, he'll have twilit ballads and, probably, some droll comments in between. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20.  PARELES    MARCO ANTONIO SOLÍS/ANA GABRIEL, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741. Latin pop lives for love songs, and this pre-Valentine's Day ''Concierto del Amor'' presents two Mexican ballad singers who wholeheartedly revel in romance. Marco Antonio Solís is suave and earnest in his yearning songs, while Ana Gabriel pours drama into songs with a streak of tragedy. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $59.50 to $99.50.  PARELES    SOULIVE, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236. Soulive is an organ-guitar-drums trio that harks back to the 1950's and 1960's, playing meaty, blues-centered jazz for dancers who like straightforward funk. Lately, it has been hooking up with a little hip-hop. Tonight at 9; tickets are $25.  PARELES    SUPER DIAMOND, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800. A tribute to the songs of Neil Diamond, particularly his triumphal 1970's material. Smirking is optional. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $26.  PARELES    *KEITH SWEAT, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070. For the not-getting-any-younger slow-jam specialist Keith Sweat, every other weekend of the year must be merely preparation for this one -- no matter what else happens (or doesn't happen) in his career, he'll probably always be a big draw around Valentine's Day. Expect an audience full of longtime fans to scream and whoop for a set full of plaintive (but never, ever wimpy) love songs, sung by a man who knows how to find a balance between tenderness and rakishness. Sunday night at 7:30, with Atlantic Starr and Meli'sa Morgan; tickets are $53.50 to $73.50.  SANNEH    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    RUTH BROWN, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, but misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to Ms. Brown's already larger-than-life musical personality. Exhibiting a flamboyant showmanship that recalls her peer James Brown, she proudly presents herself as an indomitable member of royalty and stylistic descendant of the Queen of the Blues herself, Dinah Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30, and Sunday night at 8. Cover: $50; no minimum.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed musician and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, with a $15 minimum. (An $80 dinner-and-show package is available.)  HOLDEN    *BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrichesque cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature, like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. A young tenor saxophonist with a beautiful sound, centering in the Coltrane-ish lower-middle register; if he is a little unabashedly entranced by a particular area of jazz's past, around 1955 to 1965, he does well by it. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $25.  BEN RATLIFF    RASHIED ALI QUARTET, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Best known as John Coltrane's drummer in his last few years and his foil on the duet album ''Interstellar Space,'' Mr. Ali has never stopped collaborating with up-and-coming musicians. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    J.D. ALLEN TRIO PLAYS THE MUSIC OF BUTCH MORRIS, Louis, 649 East Ninth Street, at Avenue C, East Village, (212)673-1190. J.D. Allen, an able young tenor saxophonist who has played with Betty Carter, Cindy Blackman, Eric Revis and others, is doing his part in Butch Morris's month-long ''Black February'' series of nightly performances. He's playing in most of the large improvising ensembles conducted by Mr. Morris through the month, and he's also playing this weekly gig with his own trio. On the music stand will be Mr. Morris's own compositions going back to the 1970's, which graced a number of old David Murray albums. They're powerfully appealing melodies; it's been too long since they've been heard. Tomorrow night at 8:30 pm; free admission.  RATLIFF    COOPER-MOORE/WILLIAM PARKER, Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center /LES Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4080. The multi-instrumentalist Cooper-Moore needs no special context to be understood: he plays as if he is trying to grab the attention of pedestrians on a busy street. He'll play boogie-woogie piano, pushing form into abstraction; stamp out a rhythm with hand percussion; play beautiful ballads with home-made harps, or bark out a blues on the harmonica. This performance celebrates a Cooper-Moore boxed set, on the 50 Miles of Elbow Room label, which includes five seven-inch records and a booklet inside a small cedar box. It includes solo performances by Cooper-Moore and and William Parker on bass, and a duet between the two musicians. Sunday from 3 to 6 p.m; admission is $6.  RATLIFF    GOLD SPARKLE BAND, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934. The Gold Sparkle Band has been in New York since the late 80's; it channels the East-Coast jazz avant-garde of the mid-1960's. Sunday night at 10; free admission.  RATLIFF    LEE KONITZ TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212)581-3080. Lee Konitz, the alto saxophonist, was one of Lennie Tristano's closest associates in the late 1940's and early 50's; that experience left a permanent impression on his subsequent career, in terms of repertory, instrumentation and many other things. Even so, he is as original a player as there is in jazz, with a sound that has remained limpid and innocent and an emphasis on melody that makes him always easy to follow. He plays this weekend with the brothers Ed and George Schuller, on bass and drums. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    JASON LINDNER GROUP, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1073. Jason Lindner, a smart, rhythmic pianist who brings together bop, Cuban and all sorts of progressive influences, has become a regular feature at this club; this particular group includes the bassist Reggie Washington, the drummer Tony Escapa, and as guests, the saxophonist Jimmy Vass and the singer Baba Israel. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    SERGIO MENDES, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Three decades before Bebel Gilberto could be heard in restaurants all across the country, Sergio Mendes was the populist face of Brazilian music, making albums that souped up bossa nova for international audiences. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $40 at the tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.  RATLIFF    *BUTCH MORRIS, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; Belt Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 563-0487; Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, East Village, (212)614-0505. Butch Morris has set up performances every night during February; he's calling it ''Black February,'' and this month officially celebrates 20 years of Mr. Morris's ''conductions,'' performances in which he conducts groups of improvisers, jazz or otherwise, with his own language of signals and baton movements. He's playing with different ensembles each night, and here's the weekend schedule: with Butchlandband at Zebulon, tonight at 10 and midnight; free admission; with the 18 piece Free Zone/Sound Infusion Orchestra tomorrow at 4 pm at the Belt Theater; admission is $10; with the New York Skyscraper Ensemble Sunday at 5 and 6 p.m., at Bowery Poetry Club; admission is $12. Check his Web site, www.conduction.us, for further information on these and other performances.  RATLIFF    HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue near 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253. A veteran tenor saxophonist who keeps things pleasurable. His background is in the 1950's, when a good deal of jazz was completely submerged in rhythm and blues, and he is one of the few mainstream jazz performers today who can routinely find access to the deep language of pleasure from that time. Mr. Person has an elastic, sequential solo-building style that links him to Sonny Rollins and occasionally a fat, breathy tone that links him to Ben Webster. Enjoy him. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8:30, 10 and 11:30; cover charge is $20 per set, and there is a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    *BEN RILEY'S MONK LEGACY SEPTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, 5th Floor, (212)258-9595. Led by the drummer Ben Riley, who played regularly with Thelonious Monk through the 1960's, this seven-piece band will do something unusual: play new arrangements of Monk material with no pianist. Since Monk's songs bear up beautifully through any number of reinterpretations, and since Mr. Riley is a lovingly sensitive drummer, it should be a worthwhile week. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    *JIMMY SCOTT, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, midtown, (212) 582-2121. This singer of sepulchral jazz songs keeps rolling along, with the cracks and crevices in his voice seeming either more authentic or more disturbing, depending on your point of view. But he is also one of the old-school jazz performers who know how to hold audiences tightly from beginning to end. Sets through Sunday night are at 8:30 and 10:30; cover, $35, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    JOE WILDER WITH MICHAEL WEISS TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7125. Mr. Wilder, a marvelous trumpeter who played with big bands in the 1940's and 50's and finally went full time into studio and television work, plays a kind of tabula-rasa swing language: there's very little slang in there to clog the music. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    BUSTER WILLIAMS QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. Mr. Williams, an agile bassist with a liquid tone, has been setting up bands stocked with the best players in New York. This one includes the saxophonist Steve Wilson, the pianist George Colligan and the drummer Lenny White. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    MATT WILSON'S ARTS AND CRAFTS, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Regardless of who's in his band -- and membership has changed several times over the last few years -- the jazz drummer Matt Wilson is a plenty good enough draw all by himself. Influenced by the late Billy Higgins, among others, Mr. Wilson's style swings with a fairly light touch; but he is fiendishly attentive to what his sidemen are doing, and he uses every bit they give him, playing off their gestures, stoking their furnaces in turn. He has a sense of play that's hard to miss. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, and $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'ARIANNA IN CRETA' With first-rate production values as well as musical ones devoted to professional revivals of virtually unknown works, the Gotham Chamber Opera can claim to be the pre-eminent small opera company in New York. This season is practically mainstream by the company's standards as it jumps onto the bandwagon of the current Handel fad with a work from the composer's prime (1734), the first in a planned series of Ariadne-themed operas. The cast includes some notable young singers, Caroline Worra and Hanan Alattar among them; the conductor is the company's founder, Neal Goren; Christopher Alden will direct. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212)279-4200. Tickets: $30 to $60.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'LA BOHÈME' It's been some time since the Metropolitan Opera's crowd-pleasing production of Puccini's ''Bohème'' has held much interest for adventurous opera buffs. But this season's revival offers an impressive and intriguing cast. The golden-voiced coloratura soprano Ruth Ann Swenson continues her exploration of the rich lyric soprano repertory as she sings the role of Mimi, with the hardy tenor Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo. The vibrant soprano Patricia Racette sings Musetta, with the robust baritone Dwayne Croft as her off-again, on-again boyfriend Marcello. Daniel Oren conducts. Tomorrow at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out; returned tickets may be available at the box office.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Leon Botstein and his American Symphony Orchestra keep coming at us with irresistible repertory. Sunday afternoon brings the orchestra's latest adventure into French opera: ''Le Roi Malgré Lui'' by Chabrier. This comedy for the opera stage will be performed at Avery Fisher Hall, and anyone interested in the byways of this strain of opera should try to go -- either for love or just curiosity. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53.  BERNARD HOLLAND    BARGEMUSIC There are few better places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Once a coffee barge, it offers the intimacy that chamber music demands, as well as a wonderful view of lower Manhattan through the bay windows that make up the back wall of the stage. This weekend, Mark Peskanov, the violinst and Bargemusic's executive and artistic director, presides over performances of two Mozart Divertimentos -- those in B flat (K. 287) and D (K. 334). The performers, along with Mr. Peskanov, include Aaron Boyd, violinist; Miranda Sielaff, violist; Eric Jacobsen, cellist; Timothy Cobb, bassist, and Wei-Ping Chou and Brad Gemeinhardt, hornists. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083. Tickets: $40; $25 for students.  ALLAN KOZINN    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER Ravel was a big admirer of jazz and couldn't understand why more American classical composers did not integrate it into their music. The composer himself suggested how it might be done in his catchy jazz-tinged Violin Sonata, to be performed at this concert by the fine French violinist Philippe Graffin and the pianist André-Michel Schub. Paul Neubauer (viola) and Gary Hoffman (cello) join for the remainder of the French-themed program, including music by Fauré and Saint-Saens. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875.5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48.  JEREMY EICHLER    COLUMBIA SINFONIETTA This ambitious group was founded in 2000 to address a perceived dearth of larger scale New York ensembles devoted exclusively to contemporary music. The group closed up shop after one season but it has recently re-formed under its previous director, the conductor and percussionist Jeffrey Milarsky, to pick up where it left off presenting both ''classic'' works of recent decades that are rarely heard in New York, and new compositions. In the former category this weekend will be Messiaen's ''Oiseaux Exotiques,'' an important piece from the mid-1950's that is derived, like so much of the composer's music, from bird songs. Also on the program will be a 1979 percussion work by Michael Finnissy as well as more recent music by Carlos Sánchez-Gutiérrez, David Rakowski and Eric Chasalow. Sunday at 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330. Tickets: $10.  EICHLER    *SHARON ISBIN Guitarists typically build their performances around either solo works, concertos or chamber music. Sharon Isbin, one of the finest guitarists performing now, both technically and interpretively, will draw on all three repertories in her concert on Sunday. She opens with Vivaldi's Concerto in D (RV 93), and closes with a chamber score, the Boccherini Quintet in D (G. 448). Between them, she offers an arrangement by John Duarte of the Albinoni Adagio, Mr. Duarte's own ''Joan Baez Suite'' in its New York premiere, Falla's ''Siete Canciones Populares Españolas'' and Rodrigo's ''Aranjuez ma pensée.'' Ms. Isbin's collaborators include Catherine Cho and Soovin Kim, violinists; Cynthia Phelps, violist; Carter Brey, cellist, and Daniel Druckman, percussionist. Sunday at 3, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $40.  KOZINN    MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE A few seasons ago, Dawn Upshaw joined James Levine and the Met Chamber Ensemble -- players from the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra -- in remarkably sensual, eloquent rendering of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire.'' Ms. Upshaw returns to sing the work again with Mr. Levine and company in an all-contemporary program that also includes Luigi Dallapiccola's ''Piccola Musica Notturna,'' Elliott Carter's ''Luimen'' and Schoenberg's own chamber arrangement of his Five Pieces (Op. 16). Sunday at 5, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $48 to $64.  KOZINN    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC In his last years with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, an ensemble with a great Mahler tradition, Riccardo Chailly was becoming a formidable Mahlerian. Now, in the first of his two weeks with the New York Philharmonic, an orchestra with its own personal connection to the composer, Mr. Chailly conducts Mahler's Seventh Symphony. And a fuller exposure to Mr. Chailly as a Mahlerian can be had in a recording of the Ninth Symphony with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, released late last year by Decca. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: today, $22 to $74; tomorrow and Tuesday, $25 to $90.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    JOSÉ VAN DAM Both in opera and in the song repertory, the Belgian bass-baritone José Van Dam has been among the most vocally splendid and artistically refined singers of our time. A few seasons back, as Mr. Van Dam turned 60, his voice, understandably, showed signs of decline. But in the last two years he has gained new-found vocal vitality, most recently as Golaud in the Metropolitan Opera's production of Debussy's ''Pelléas et Mélisande.'' At 64 he is singing with uncanny freshness and incomparable artistry. His recital, the first of two programs for Lincoln Center's ''Art of the Song'' series, should be marvelous. With the pianist Maciej Pikulski, he will sing French works by Fauré, Debussy, Massenet, Berlioz and Bizet. (The second program is on Wednesday) Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $48.  TOMMASINI    'GAY VALENTINE MUSIC CELEBRATION' Tomorrow night Canticorum Virtuosi, the nonprofit organization that oversees the activities of two respected area choruses, the New York Virtuoso Singers and the Canticum Novum Singers, presents an elaborate and eclectic concert to honor ''same-sex love and affection,'' to quote the presenters. The distinguished and varied roster of performers includes the composer and pianist David Del Tredici, the Paul Taylor Dance Company, the tenor John Wesley Wright, the Gay Gotham Chorus, the Ambassador Singers of the New York City Gay Men's Chorus, a roster of cabaret performers and Harold Rosenbaum directing the Canticum Novum Singers and the New York Virtuoso Singers. The program is a benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. Tomorrow night at 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-7171. Tickets: $20 to $100.  TOMMASINI    NIKOLAI MEDTNER This Russian pianist and composer, who died in 1951, is no longer a household name, but his passionate supporters during his lifetime included Rachmaninoff, who in 1912 labeled him ''the most talented of all the modern composers.'' Medtner's late-Romantic solo and chamber works are the focus of a program tonight that, with David Dubal as host, features a selection of piano miniatures or ''Skazki'' (''fairytales'') as well as his Piano Quintet in C, among other works. Tonight at 8, Renee Weiler Concert Hall, Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212)242-4770. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 65+.  EICHLER    ORLANDO CONSORT Among the challenges of performing very old music are, first, figuring out how it went and, second, making it come alive. Both challenges are grist for the mill of this male vocal quartet, founded in 1988 (but recently joined by a new tenor), celebrated for its performances of music written before 1500, and supported by musicologists in preparing varied programs like this weekend's, which includes music from their latest album, devoted to the 15th-century composer Antoine Busnois. Other star composers -- stars, at least, to specialists in this particular area -- are Hayne van Ghizeghem, Walter Lambe and Henry VIII. Tomorrow night at 8, Low Library Rotunda at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $35; $21 for students.  MIDGETTE    TOKYO STRING QUARTET The Tokyo String Quartet is currently in residence at the 92d Street Y, and the theme of the series of concerts it has been performing is immigrant composers. Tomorrow's program consists of the ''Rider'' Quartet from Haydn's Op. 74, Zemlinski's Fourth Quartet and Hanns Eisler's Septet No. 2 with added flute, piccolo, clarinet and bassoon. Viewing Haydn as an immigrant stretches the point. The Op. 74 may have coincided with his famous visits to London, but that is all. Still Haydn is always welcome regardless of passport status. Zemlinski and Eisler, who ended up back in East Germany, are legitimate topics. Tomorrow night at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $35.  HOLLAND    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.    BEIJING MODERN DANCE COMPANY A troupe founded in 1995 and one of the principal forces in contemporary Chinese dance makes its New York debut in ''Rear Light,'' an evening-long work to music by Pink Floyd that reflects the struggle of a young Chinese generation to reconcile traditional culture with influences from abroad and a thirst for intellectual freedom. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $34.  JACK ANDERSON    AKIM FUNK BUDDHA The ever-exuberant Mr. Buddha (or is it Funk Buddha?) specializes in dance-theater that combines unblinking stillness, storytelling, tap and Mongolian throat-singing. He adds martial arts, breakdancing, beat-boxing, and Japanese, Zulu and urban English talk to the mix in his new ''Amazulu: Dance as a Weapon: the Hip-Hop Circus -- Part I.'' Tonight and tomorrow (and next Thursday through Saturday) at 10 p.m.; Sunday (and next Sunday) at 5:30 p.m. La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, west of Second Avenue, Manhattan, (212)475-7710 or www.lamama.org. Tickets: $15.  JENNIFER DUNNING    'BUTTER MELTS AWAY MY LETTERS' Choreographed by Stephanie Rafferty and conceived and directed by Gian Marco Lo Forte, this theater-dance piece visits a group of young runaways to New York City who cannot quite shrug off the past. Tonight and tomorrow (and Thursdays through Saturdays through Feb. 26) at 8 p.m.; Sunday (and Sundays through Feb. 27) at 2:30 and 8 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street west of Second Avenue, Manhattan (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $15; TDF vouchers accepted.  DUNNING    *FLAMENCO FESTIVAL The festival closes with ''Flamenco at the Crossroads,'' in which the dancer Rafaela Carrasco will join traditional and new-style flamenco singers in an exploration of this age-old Gypsy art. Sunday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $22 to $69. And for those who wish to continue the exploration, there is a free series saluting the great Spanish filmmaker Carlos Saura and his flamenco films, many made with Antonio Gades, ending on Feb. 23 with Mr. Saura's classic, all-encompassing ''Flamenco.'' Wednesdays beginning at 6 p.m. Instituto Cervantes, 211-215 East 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-7720 or www.cervantes.org.  DUNNING    'I LOVE TANGO' This ''tango musical'' boasts four dancers and live string, bandoneon, piano and vocal music. Tonight (and Thursdays and Fridays through March 25) at 8 p.m.; tomorrow (and Saturdays through March 26) at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays (through March 27) at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718)729-3880 or www.thaliatheatre.org. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+; $25 (on Thursdays).  DUNNING    MARK JARECKE A choreographer who has studied philosophy as well as dance and whose creations often have an architectural quality offers ''Dendron,'' an in-the-round piece during which the audience is free to move around the performance area. Theatergoers are also encouraged to bring portable radios with earphones to savor the shifts in the sound environment by Chris Peck and Jon Moniaci. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at Tenth Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    CLEO MACK DANCE PROJECT Ms. Mack and her New Jersey-based company specialize in modern dance that she describes as ''highly choreographed life.'' The program includes new and recent dances that explore emotional states and one in which a 30-foot long skirt is a character. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, Manhattan, (908)561-5454. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    MOISEYEV DANCE COMPANY Russia's most famous folk-dance troupe makes its only New York appearance this season. Founded in 1936 by Igor Moiseyev, who at 98 continues to choreograph, the company is known for its spirited acrobatic dancing, theatrical flair and a repertory of works from Russia and many European and Asian nations. The dancing world travelers also perform American jazz and rock pieces. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, near Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Brooklyn, (718)951-4500. Tickets: $45, $40.  ANDERSON    PARSONS DANCE COMPANY The program includes four modern-dance pieces by David Parsons, a former Paul Taylor star, and music by the Ahn Trio, a group of three Korean-born sisters. Tonight at 8, Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C.W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, (516)299-3100 or www.tillescenter.org. Tickets: $38, $50 and $60; $35; $47 and $57 (65+).  DUNNING    ROCHA DANCE THEATER This program of modern-dance choreography by Jenny Rocha and the guest artist Kelli Wicke Davis, explores hidden human behavior, in part to music by Marty Beller. It includes -- we like this -- a piece with interactive newspaper costumes. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, Manhattan, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS Dances of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Inuit, Hop and Pueblo peoples will be included in this 30th annual Pow-Wow, along with a new modern-dance piece by Tom Pearson, a Creek Cherokee. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue at Tenth Street, Manhattan (212) 254-1109. Tickets: $10; $1 for children under 12 accompanying ticket-bearing adults on Sunday.

DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'CONTEMPORARY VOICES: WORKS FROM THE UBS ART COLLECTION.' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through April 25. What's wrong with this picture? The Museum of Modern Art, the most visionary museum of the 20th century, is inaugurating the temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with an exhibition of gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep the ensemble from feeling corporate, monotonous and by-the-book. The 40 (of 64) works given or promised to the Modern are nearly all by white, male artists and they are all already represented in the collection. There's nothing wrong with the individual works by artists like Philip Guston, Jasper Johns and Vija Celmins that won't be cured by integrating them into the Modern's collection, but the ensemble effect is dispiriting. With an emphasis on a narrow swath of the 1980's mainstream, the show feels like an excessively edited letter in a bottle from an art world that no longer exists. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  ROBERTA SMITH    'RUTH DUCKWORTH, MODERNIST SCULPTOR,' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, through April 3. A sculptor whose basic medium is clay, Ms. Duckworth makes everything from tiny, delicate vessels to monumental outdoor sculptures. Though her work fits in -- but not too neatly -- with the modernist tradition, her eye has roamed everywhere, resulting in a bewildering variety of styles and influences, from Brancusi to a beef bone found in her soup. Sometimes the influences combine awkwardly, making her work seem a little strained and quirky, but often enough her venturesomeness pays off, producing images of eloquence and power. Hours: Daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $6 for 65+ and students. Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. is pay what you wish.  GRACE GLUECK    *'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day, but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to have been. A few of the paintings mustered as evidence are pretty strange; many are glorious. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.  HOLLAND COTTER    'IMAGES OF DON QUIXOTE: THE ART OF ILLUSTRATION AND PRINTMAKING,' the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, (212)926-2234, through Feb. 20. A few years back, a poll of international writers voted ''Don Quixote'' the greatest book of all time. This year Cervantes's novel is four centuries old, and the Hispanic Society of America is celebrating the occasion with this exhibition of illustrations of the story printed from the 17th through 20th centuries. Despite its small size, the show demonstrates how attitudes toward the book changed in different eras, from raucous comedy to Romantic tragedy. And in designs by artists like John Vanderbank, Fragonard and Gustave Doré, there are fascinating images and ideas to consider. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 4 p.m. Free.  COTTER    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was one of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  KEN JOHNSON    Galleries: Uptown    MIQUEL BARCELÓ, C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through March 5. Paint as a natural force is the consuming interest of Mr. Barceló, a Spanish artist steeped in a grand realist tradition. His feeling for the past includes an admiration for the lush Spanish still lifes known as bodegónes. But his abstract-figurative use of paint, in thick impasto crusts and slathers, is also indebted to the dense pigment-plus canvases of post-World War II idols like Jackson Pollock, Antoni Tapiès, and Jean Dubuffet. His surfaces are often bulked up with vegetative matter, sand and other materials to suggest natural surfaces like the sea and its inner life.  GLUECK    Galleries: 57th Street    'LEON POLK SMITH: FORMS AND FUNCTIONS,' Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212)397-6780, through March 5. Spaces and their boundaries fascinated this hard-edge abstractionist (1906-1996) and in this show of his biomorphic paintings from the 1950's his elegantly calculated contrivance of one space impinging on another pleasingly asks the eye to tease out figure-ground relationships. In ''Over Easy,'' a large, partly heart-shaped figure of mauve thrusts on to a black ground at an angle; or is it the curvy black space that cuts into the aggressor? Smith's clean, flat surfaces, each restricted to two colors, are shown with examples of sleek, minimal contoured furniture by front-line designers of the period, Charles and Ray Eames and Isamu Noguchi among them. The biomorphic shapes of the furniture and their colors play nicely off Smith's snart, snappy formats.  GLUECK    'VIEW EIGHT: A FEW DOMESTIC OBJECTS INTERROGATE A FEW WORKS OF ART,' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)752-2929, through Feb. 26. This canny show of artworks and objects of design includes Josiah McElheny's curvy mirrored coffee table bearing mirrored blobby objects; beautiful blobby ceramic sculptures by Ken Price; delicate, biomorphic hanging lights by Lionel Theodore Dean; a twisted, retro-futuristic orange bench by Sachio Hihara; and, like the nightmare that domestic utopianism tries to insulate us from, one of Lee Bontecou's early, scarily militaristic reliefs.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    *'LOG CABIN,' Artists Space,38 Greene Street, (212)226-3970, through Feb. 26. Given the cultural climate, wedding bells won't be playing ''Over the Rainbow'' any time soon, and men and women won't be coming out of the closet and going into the Army. So what can Log Cabin Republicans, gay supporters of the ruling party, be thinking? This is one of the questions posed, however indirectly, by the 33 participants in a snappy, discursive group show that serves as field report on what art with queer identity as a theme is looking like these days. As surveyed by the curator, Jeffrey Uslip, it's looking good and heterogeneous: ambisexual, interracial and multigenerational, though short on lesbian artists, who are making some of the best work anywhere.  COTTER    'WHO IS THE PROTAGONIST?' Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, (212)625-9224, through Feb. 26. This engaging exhibition about approaches to storytelling includes a life-size space station interior handmade by Lisi Raskin; a Modernist theater environment with a mysterious sci-fi video called ''Moon Colony'' by Ohad Meromi, the show's organizer; a short, strange sci-fi story written by Halsey Rodman; a storyboard for a film about a father and his young son by Guy Ben-Ner; and a Pop-Cubist head of cut and painted paper by Ryan Johnson.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    KNUT ASDAM: 'FILTER CITY,' Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212)807-9494, through Feb. 19. This Norwegian artist who has exhibited extensively in Europe presents a slow, enigmatic, 21-minute film about two young women -- one small and white, the other tall and black -- who, between long pauses, emit oracular, world-weary utterances about social issues and obscure personal concerns. It is well-produced and nice to watch, though it borders inadvertently on a parody of pretentious avant-garde filmmaking.  JOHNSON    SANTE D'ORAZIO: 'PAM: AMERICAN ICON,' Stellan Holm, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, through March 5. Pamela Anderson -- yes, that Pamela Anderson -- in all her pneumatic, mostly unclothed glory is the subject of large and surrealistically vivid photographs that were originally commissioned but not published by Playboy magazine. Students: discuss criteria for judging the value -- aesthetic and otherwise -- of these artworks.  JOHNSON    JOHN LURIE, Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, (212)929-8180, through Feb. 26. The stream-of-consciousness notational ink drawings and radiant gouaches of the musician John Lurie have precedents in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat and William Wegman's early Conceptual drawings and maybe the cartoons of Roz Chast, but they have their own sense of wiry line and texture, wordplay, sexual bluntness and radiant color.  SMITH    NATARAJ SHARMA, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212)989-7074, through Feb. 19. The first New York solo exhibition of this Indian painter who has exhibited internationally is too diverse to give a clear picture of what he is about, but the best works have an intriguing allegorical resonance. They are made in a neat and orderly style combining Pop, photo-based realism and hints of Indian traditionalism. Most impressive is the large picture in which a naked man peeps into a temple filled with an semiabstract orgy of interpenetrating pink bodies.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    MATTHEW ANTEZZO, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, (212)431-4977, through March 13. Among works by the artist known for deadpan copies of art magazine ads are nondescript penciled copies of photographs of feminist heroines like Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem; copies in pencil of news photographs of American Indian protest events that took place in 1975; and a painting of an ancient statue of Diogenes of Sinope titled ''Cynic.'' What it all means could keep an undergraduate seminar busy for some time.  JOHNSON    NEW YORK'S FINEST, Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through March 5. This exhibition of paintings by 19 mostly young and emerging artists has an eclectic, anarchic spirit. The common ground includes an interest in material, be it the store-bought fabric with which Joe Bradley conjures up a Minimalist seaman, or the Expressionist effusions of Anke Weyer and Wallace Whitney. Variations on a knowing but unjaded Pop-Expressionism prevail, mixed in varying ratios by Katherine Bernhardt, Brendan Cass, Bill Saylor, Carrie Moyer and Josh Smith, who has lately abandoned paper for canvas to good effect. ''Laissez-faire, but mean it!'' might be the collective rallying cry.  SMITH    Last Chance    'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, closing on Sunday. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphosing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  COTTER    'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, closing on Monday. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with inspiring the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold Bocklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, a star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.  SMITH    CORY ARCANGEL, Team Gallery, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219, closing tomorrow. In one of the season's best debuts, the collaboratively inclined Cory Arcangel and his cohorts create quasi-interactive sound and video pieces of startling and subversive beauty by commandeering various electronic or digital staples including music videos, karaoke tunes, video games, the Internet and even a long phone message. The sense that anything man-made is grist for personal expression is exhilarating.  SMITH    'ONE-ARMED BANDIT,' D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-9460, closing tomorrow. This three-artist show is notable mainly for its playful installation. Presented in groups of three with each artwork framed by red tape applied to the wall, Polly Apfelbaum's gridded drawings of cartoon blossoms on white velvet, Tony Feher's flattened, glitter-covered found boxes and Joanne Greenbaum's buoyant abstract pictures are displayed in various permutations like slot machine icons.

Broadway    +'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $96.25.  BEN BRANTLEY    +'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by an Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BRANTLEY    *+'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow water(2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    +'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience to prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to David Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.  BRANTLEY    +'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.  BRANTLEY    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and longtime Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, and featuring some funny riffs on familiar archetypes, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.  BRANTLEY    +++'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco (his last performance is Sunday), Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    + 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. (Think ''The Children's Hour'' crossed with ''Agnes of God.'') But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    'FAT PIG' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.  BRANTLEY    *'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. ''Gods,'' which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances.  BRANTLEY    ++'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction There are circumcision jokes aplenty, of course, and the requisite zingers about controlling Jewish mothers. and their daughters who don't put out. Several bits are funny despite the familiarity, as when a mother unleashes a volley of questions at her prospective son-in-law with the speed and accuracy of an ace machine-gunner. Later, a woman's status as an imposter is revealed when it's recalled that she paid retail for the Chanel bag. So it goes for two hours. Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'K.I. FROM CRIME' We can all bring to mind a list of literary characters it might be edifying to spend some time with, but Katerina Ivanovna, from ''Crime and Punishment,'' probably isn't on your list. A minor figure in the novel, she is the miserable, impoverished widow of a hopeless drunk. In a grim scene, she presides over a funeral banquet for her husband. Racked with a consumptive cough, she belittles the seedy guests who have bothered to show up, fumes at the indifference of the more respectable ones who haven't, bemoans the fate of her fatherless children. Now, thanks to the wonders of the contemporary stage, you're invited. Theatergoers who delight in audience participation will not want to miss the New York debut of the Lithuanian-born director Kama Ginkas. Audience members, who are conscripted into the roles of Katerina's guests, must listen patiently to her long tale of woe. But since most of the monologue is delivered in Russian, only those conversant with the language will grasp the nuances of her plight. Ms. Mysina gives a boldly physical, emotionally transparent performance, but there is no development of her character. And while it may seem paradoxical, involving an audience in a theatrical performance tends to lessen its impact. The self-consciousness that results shuts the lid on imaginative empathy (1:30). Freight Entrance Theater, 208 West 37th Street, Manhattan. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $40. Sold out for the run of the show.  ISHERWOOD    ++'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Ms. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousness of Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.  ISHERWOOD    'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    +'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the clichéd. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    +'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed by David Schweizer as if it were a traffic jam, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow and Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.

Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelgänger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams and line their pocketbooks.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds (and in the process takes away Mr. Law's ''Sexiest Man Alive'' title without much of a fight).  A.O. SCOTT    'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, no relation to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown, as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.  SCOTT    'ELEKTRA' Starring Jennifer Garner, Terence Stamp, Kirsten Prout, Goran Visnjic, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 96 minutes). The latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, ''Elektra'' stars Ms. Garner as a superheroine who dons fetish-wear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight. ''Your parents must have had a sense of humor,'' the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to Elektra about her mythopoetic name. She answers in the negative: no, they did not, and neither does she. This chick may have a complex (or two), but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of Marvel Comics, she emphatically does not have a sense of humor. What she emphatically does have -- and this of course is the entire point of ''Elektra'' -- is a hot bod and a costume that looks as if it was designed by someone very familiar with the Victoria's Secret catalog.  DARGIS    'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie, and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.  DARGIS    *'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes). In German and Turkish, with English subtitles. Love doesn't just hurt in the jagged German romance ''Head-On''; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Birol Unel) and Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about this two perfectly imperfect beings.  DARGIS    'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller, based on fact, performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a hundred-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.  DARGIS    'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (aka Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.  DARGIS    'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and new species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Acquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their own reveries and fantasies.  SCOTT    'A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG' Starring John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Shainee Gabel (R, 119 minutes). In this first feature directed by Ms. Gabel, Mr. Travolta delivers a hammed-up scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in ''Primary Colors.'' This is the story of a down-at-the-heels former star professor and his protégé rotting in the New Orleans house bequeathed them by a legendary folk-blues singer, and their partial redemption when the singer's alienated daughter comes to live with them. The film dawdles along aimlessly for two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise. The movie's hokey solemnity suggests ''The Mundane Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood'' or ''The Notebook Goes to the Big Easy.'' The movie is another example of Hollywood going soft and squishy when it goes South.  HOLDEN    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr.Owen Wilson).  DARGIS    'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velázquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer, immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.  SCOTT    'MONSIEUR N' Starring Philippe Torreton, Richard E. Grant, Jay Rodan and Elsa Zylberstein. Directed by Antoine de Caunes (Not rated, 127 minutes). In French, with English subtitles. This densely plotted costume drama, which flashes back from the exhumation of Napoleon Bonaparte's body in 1840 Paris to the years leading up to his death in 1921 on the remote island of St. Helena, imagines that his official death might have been an elaborate hoax. The screenplay is peppered with Napoleon's epigrammatic zingers, which reveal him as the smartest person in the room. Mr. Torreton's glowering emperor exerts a magnetic if slightly repellent spell. Mr. Grant, as Hudson Lowe, the British governor in charge of the island, is almost as fine in the role of a raging control freak whose behavior is more stereotypically Napoleonic than Napoleon's. If the movie amounts to little more than a historical divertissement, it is well done.  HOLDEN    'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in this enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick, a trio of crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues, and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean, played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction, is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box-office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again, Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack; Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan; and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs. Also on board for the return trip are Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Eddie Jemison, Shaobo Qin and a delightful Carl Reiner, joined by the new recruit Catherine Zeta-Jones as Isabel, a European super cop who favors curve-hugging skirts and the sort of dangerous high heels women wear only so they can kick them off in the bedroom.  DARGIS    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micro-managing phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, the prentious clutter of which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-and-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.  SCOTT    'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles -- all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all of them treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou, Gaspard Ulliel, Jean-Pierre Becker, Dominique Bettenfeld, Clovis Cornillac and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amelie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose résumé hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that, on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror, and his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.  DARGIS    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    BOBBY BARE JR., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700. Bobby Bare Jr. is an even more eccentric Nashville songwriter than his father was. His music can float down-home Americana in a psychedelic haze; his lyrics are blunt, unsentimental and pugnacious as he sings about the road and some down-and-out characters including himself. Tonight at 11:30, with Sarah Lee Guthrie and Johnny Irion at 9:30 and Hula at 8:30; admission is $10.  JON PARELES    BLUE OYSTER CULT, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144 and The Chance, 6 Crannel Street, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (845)471-1966. When science fiction met heavy metal and light-hearted fetishism in Blue Oyster Cult songs of the 70's like ""Cities on Flame With Rock 'n' Roll,"" ""(Don't Fear) the Reaper,"" ""Godzilla"" and ""Dominance and Submission,"" it hardly mattered whether the band's original intentions were tongue-in-cheek. Its post-Zeppelin, pre-punk riffs, its wild-eyed lyrics and Buck Dharma's lead guitar lines still sound good. At B.B. King tonight at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $32. At the Chance tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $28.50.  PARELES    *TYONDAI BRAXTON, THE SOFT CIRCLE, ZS, ROB LOWE, PREFUSE 73, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. An appealing quintuple bill bringing together a crew of beats-and-noise-influenced eccentrics. Mr. Braxton uses effects and electronics and sometimes guitars to create resounding sounds and songs. The Soft Circle is the new project from Hisham Bharoocha, formerly of the (very) post-punk sound sculptors Black Dice. Zs is a band known for grand, saxophone-driven compositions. They are to be joined by Rob Lowe, the bass player from 90 Day Men (not, of course, the startlingly well-preserved star of the short-lived drama ""Dr. Vegas""), and the producer Prefuse 73, who is to play a DJ set. Sunday night at 9; tickets are $10.  KELEFA SANNEH    CARLSONICS, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, (212)505-3733. Steeped in 1960's rock, the Carlsonics crosspollinate the Who, the Byrds and half a dozen garage bands for songs that revel in the way guitars work up to big, jubilant drones. Tomorrow night at 11, with American Watercolor Movement at midnight, Aloke at 10, Undersea Explosion at 9, Miniwatt at 8:30 and Pleasure Technicians at 7:30; admission is $8.  PARELES    D.J. LE SPAM AND THE SPAM ALL-STARS, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940. D.J. Le Spam's regular club shows became a sensation in Miami, where he mixed the electronic rhythms of dance-club music with live musicians steeped in Cuban salsa, and the balance has tipped toward the live band. S.O.B.'s has given him a New York outpost. Tonight at 11; tickets are $12  PARELES    *KENNY DOPE, APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 414-4245. Kenny Dope, the hip-hop-obsessed half of the pioneering house duo Masters at Work, comes to this meatpacking-district bar for a party that's sure to be cramped and sweaty and exuberant. One of the unexpected pleasures of living in New York City is the opportunity to see big-name DJs in venues as small as this one. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $8.  SANNEH    ROBERTA FLACK, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Behind the gentle, tremulous voice that confided hits like ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is long knowledge of the continuum of blues, gospel, soul and jazz. Ms. Flack can use just a touch of rawness to make her songs hit home. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $48.50 in advance, $52 tomorrow.  PARELES    BUDDY GUY, LITTLE MILTON, THE HOWLIN' WOLF BAND, THE MUDDY WATERS BAND, ROBERT JR. LOCKWOOD, DAVID HONEYBOY EDWARDS, Avery Fisher Hall, Broadway at 65th Street, (212)731-6500. This all-star bill follows the blues from the Delta to Chicago, with spiky Mississippi blues from David Honeyboy Edwards and a jazz-tinged version of it by Robert Jr. Lockwood, who learned directly from Robert Johnson (hence the Jr.). Then come the Chicago electric blues, with two bands of alumni who backed Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, including James Cotton on harmonica and Pinetop Perkins on piano. The headliner, Buddy Guy, is a high-adrenalin bluesman who wrings drama from every speed-fingered guitar line and vocal rasp, and he'll be joined by the ever suave Little Milton. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $35 to $90.  PARELES    *KRISTIN HERSH/BEN WEAVER, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Kristin Hersh was the songwriter behind the jumpy, oddly cantilevered tunes and surreal imagery of Throwing Muses. Motherhood and perspective have made her songs more serene, though barely less enigmatic, and lately she has been touring with her hardest-rocking group yet, 50 Foot Wave. This is an acoustic solo set. Ben Weaver promises, ""I'm not gonna give you what you want to hear,"" unless that happens to be hard-won, country-rooted Americana full of weary determination and aphoristic clarity, somewhere between the Band and Tom Waits. Tomorrow and Sunday nights at 7; admission is $15.  PARELES    REID PALEY TRIO, CBGB, 315 Bowery at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052. Reid Paley pounds basic chords and bellows his songs as he plays the role of the hard-drinking misanthrope, aiming for the perfect combination of self-pity and spite. Tonight at 8 on a bill with American Ambulance, the Droves, Kings County Queens, Peg Simone and Curtis Eller. Admission is $10.  PARELES    POPA CHUBBY PLAYS HENDRIX, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Popa Chubby hails from the Bronx, but his heart is in steamy, rambunctious blues and 1960's blues-rock. For this show, he's playing Jimi Hendrix songs. Sunday night at 8; admission is free.  PARELES    THE IDAN RAICHEL PROJECT, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824. The Israeli musician Idan Raichel moved from session work to a solo career in 2002, and his debut album zoomed to No.1 in Israel. His two album mix electronic loops, ethnic samples and hints of anything from reggae to lounge music to Ethiopian singing to pop ballads sung in Hebrew. His music can be simultaneously peripatetic and introspective. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 to $55.  PARELES    TOSHI REAGON AND BIG LOVELY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Singing about both love and politics with the same sense of independence, Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and syncopated guitar playing to songs steeped in blues and funk. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:30; tickets are $20.  PARELES    ROGER SANCHEZ, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. Mr. Sanchez, a local DJ and producer, helped invent contemporary New York dance music, occasionally adding Latin rhythms to his clattering house-inspired beats. Ever since his 2002 award for a No Doubt remix, he's invariably called a ""Grammy-winning DJ,"" although that title seems like faint praise. Last year he issued ""Release Yourself Vol. 3"" (Stealth), an appealing double-disc mix that starts with gauzy, disco-influenced mood music and ends with Carl Kennedy's buoyant and precise house track, ""The Love You Bring Me."" Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $20 in advance, $30 at the door.  SANNEH    *MARTIN SEXTON/JILL SOBULE, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. The singer and songwriter Martin Sexton can groan like an alternative rocker, slide like a soul man or leap up to a pearly falsetto. Singing about restlessness and love while he picks syncopations on his guitar, he can turn an ordinary song into a jazzy showcase, and a good one into a transmission from the heart. Jill Sobule's 1995 hit, ""I Kissed a Girl,"" showed her light-hearted side, but her girlish voice and folk-pop arrangements can be subterfuge, as she ponders love, time and human nature. She knows that simplicity and innocence aren't necessarily the same. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $28.75 in advance, $30 the day of the show.  PARELES    TOMMY STINSON, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. The most famous tonsils in rock belong to Tommy Stinson, who was the wild-card lead guitarist in the Replacements when they belted ""Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out."" His resume also includes a stint in the latter-day Guns N' Roses and his own more introspective solo album. Tomorrow night at 11, with the Black Spoons at 10, Todd Deatherage at 9 and the Victoria Lucas at 8; admission is $10.  PARELES    THE UNSANE, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. Formed in 1988, the Unsane play intransigent hard rock: a chain of burly, asymmetrical riffs behind distorted vocal imprecations. Tonight at 9, with Monumentals, Lamont and Penny Winblood; admission is $10.  PARELES    LIZZIE WEST, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212)533-2680. Lizzie West sings folk-rocking songs about love, family and wanderlust, with a warm, reedy voice reminiscent of Natalie Merchant. Tonight at 9:30, sharing a bill with Lucy Woodward; admission is $12.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    *BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrich-like cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.  HOLDEN    *'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra''' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30; $20 at the bar; $10 minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    *GERI ALLEN TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. Since the 1980's, like so many other jazz bandleaders, the pianist Geri Allen has diversified, making records that wind through folk and rock and lullabies. But she's also laid down a remarkable track record making straightforward trio albums with first-rate drummers and bassists. Her latest, ''The Life of a Song'' (Telarc), with the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette, picks up this thread, and it's her best album in years. She'll undoubtedly play some of her new trio music this weekend, with the bassist Darryl Hall and the drummer Jimmy Cobb. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  BEN RATLIFF    HAROLD ARLEN CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592. In which singers -- including Ann Hampton Callaway, Paula West, Dena DeRose, Andy Bey and Grady Tate -- and a solid straight-ahead jazz band interpret some of the better songs of the 20th century, all written by one man. (Possible candidates: ''Blues in the Night,'' ''I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues,'' ''My Shining Hour,'' ''A Sleepin' Bee.'') Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $25 at the tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.  RATLIFF    BRUCE BARTH TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7000. Mr. Barth, who has made a series of fine if overlooked records since leaving Terence Blanchard's group a decade ago, is a reliable index of what the best of modern, mainstream jazz piano playing sounds like. A moderate, organized player, he swings as much as possible and doesn't let the music get away from him. But he also brings a degree of percussive aggression to the music, which sounds even more powerful inside these boundaries. His trio includes the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Montez Coleman. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    *'GREAT LATIN JAZZ VOCALISTS' WITH THE LINCOLN CENTER AFRO-LATIN JAZZ ORCHESTRA, Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)721-6500. Recently organized and working under the umbrella of Jazz at Lincoln Center, this ensemble is led by the pianist Arturo O'Farrill. Its stated mission is to play not only the work of the great Latin jazz orchestras like Machito's and Tito Puente's, but also music from South America and elsewhere in the Caribbean. It's a big step for the recognition and canonization of Latin jazz, and the project is starting off on the right foot. This concert spotlights the great singers of Latin jazz, and the guests include Graciela, of Machito's band, as well as the newer jazz vocalist Claudia Acuña and the marvelous salsa singer Herman Olivera. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Tickets: $10 to $150.  RATLIFF    CHARLES GAYLE, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, (718)218-6934. A hard-blowing, occasionally brilliant tenor saxophonist, Mr. Gayle was notorious in the early 1990's as the living redux of the first free-jazz era; more recently he has pulled back from the precipice a bit. Tonight at 10; no cover charge or minimum.  RATLIFF    ARI HOENIG TRIO, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)675-6056. In the group led by the pianist Jean-Michel Pilc, the drummer Ari Hoenig can be as manic and furious as the bandleader; in other contexts he can lay back. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; cover charge is $10.  RATLIFF    STEFON HARRIS'S BLACKOUT, Dizzy's Club, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)258-9595. Arriving on the jazz scene in the late 1990's and becoming a worthwhile bandleader in a great hurry, the vibraphonist Stefon Harris has started to concern himself with reaching new audiences: his latest group is colored by synthesizer and powered by funk. But it still adheres to many of jazz's principles of interaction. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    LATIN PERCUSSION SUMMIT, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155. A gathering of some of the great Latin-music percussionists of several different generations, including the congueros Carlos (Patato) Valdes, Candido Camero and Ray Barretto, and the timbalero Nicky Marrero. Sets tomorrow night are at 8 and 10; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    *GREGOIRE MARET TRIO, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. On bandstands run by Jimmy Scott, Cassandra Wilson, Steve Coleman and others, this Swiss chromatic harmonica player has been extraordinary, pushing through solos with incantatory power. Don't worry about the novelty of his instrument; Mr. Maret gives it all the gravity it needs. This is a new group, with the guitarist Charlie Hunter and the percussionist Mino Cinelu. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 a set, $10 for members.  RATLIFF    JIMMY McGRIFF, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253. Mr. McGriff came from the golden period of Hammond B-3 organ playing, starting out in the early 1960's; he helped create the durable American archetype of soul-jazz. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10 and 11:30; cover charge is $25, and there is a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    *JASON MORAN AND BANDWAGON, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. The imaginative young pianist's new album, ''Same Mother'' (Blue Note), busies itself with the blues -- not just the blues structure in jazz, but the blues. The results are probably not what you have in mind. In beguiling new music (with the guitarist Marvin Sewell added to his regular trio to see it through), he flirts with a durable idiom that could easily eclipse his own; instead, the music turns out stubborn and almost perversely personal, with a thousand edges. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night. The cover charge is $25; $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    NICHOLAS PAYTON TRIBUTE TO MILES DAVIS, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)582-2121. The trumpeter Nicholas Payton first grabbed the jazz world's attention with his remarkable feeling for early New Orleans jazz, and more recently made an obstinately spaced-out funk record, but he's spent most of his professional time dealing with the rich languages of post-1960 jazz. Here he'll be mining that territory alongside his best foil, the saxophonist Tim Warfield, as well as the bassist Vicente Archer, the pianist Scott Kinsey, the drummer Adonis Rose and the percussionist Danny Sadownick. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $35 tonight and tomorrow night, $32.50 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum all nights .  RATLIFF    JEFF (TAIN) WATTS BAND, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. Mr. Watts, who played with Wynton Marsalis's group through the 1980's and continues to play with Branford Marsalis, is one of the most influential, important and complete drummers of the last two decades. His attack can be monsoonlike, but he knows the value of open space, and he can take over a band with a simple, slow-building pattern. The group this weekend includes the pianist David Budway, the bassist Eric Revis, the guitarist Paul Bollenback and the saxophonist Yosvany Terry. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    MADAMA BUTTERFLY The Puccini favorite returns to the Met after a mid-season hiatus. Giancarlo del Monaco's unreconstructed production plays the opera straight, with storybook images of rural Japan delivered without a trace of irony. The singers who opened the opera this past fall have returned to fill the principal roles. Cio-Cio-San is sung by Kallen Esperian, who gave an attractive and affecting performance back in September, save some insecurity in her upper range. Roberto Aronica returns as Pinkerton, a role that he sang more convincingly than he acted on opening night. And Vassily Gerello will again sing Sharpless, one hopes with the subtlety and luster he displayed earlier this season. Emmanuel Villaume conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.  JEREMY EICHLER    PELLÉAS ET MÉLISANDE The cast looks very promising for the Met's revival of Jonathan Miller's haunting 1995 production of ''Pelléas et Mélisande,'' Debussy's masterpiece of emotional ambiguity and murky Impressionistic harmony, a story of powerfully illicit love. The rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter sings the frightened and evasive Mélisande and the ardent tenor William Burden sings Pelléas, the aimless, impulsive young man who falls hopelessly in love with her, though she is unhappily married to his half-brother, Golaud. Singing Golaud is the ageless bass-baritone José van Dam, who recorded the role under the conductor Herbert von Karajan in 1978. James Levine, who reveres this score, will conduct. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    TURANDOT The American soprano Andrea Gruber takes on the daunting title role of Puccini's ''Turandot'' in the Met's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's gargantuan and glittering 1987 production, so popular that it is critic-proof. Ms. Gruber has been singing some formidable repertory since returning to the fold of the Met in 2001, and her enormous voice shows signs of wear and stridency. Still, her singing is fearless and impassioned and through sheer force of will she excels in the role. The tenor Johan Botha is a heroic Calàf; the soprano Krassimira Stoyanova brings affecting vulnerability and throbbing richness to the role of Liù. Bertrand de Billy conducts a colorful and exciting account of Puccini's final opera. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out; returns may be available at the box office.  TOMMASINI    Classical Music    *ARTEK Monteverdi has become one of this period-instrument band's specialties; for Artek's contribution to Music Before 1800's 30th season, it is presenting arias, duets and ensemble pieces from Monteverdi three extant operas, ''L'Orfeo,'' ''Il Ritorno d'Ulisse'' and ''L'Incoronazione di Poppea.'' Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights. (212)666-9266. Tickets: $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+.  ALLAN KOZINN    FOCUS FESTIVAL The grand finale of this year's Focus Festival brings forth some of the festival's bigger guns tonight at the Juilliard Theater. The Juilliard Symphony will be conducted by the eminent Dutch musician and new-music sympathist Reinbert de Leeuw. The composers are Shostakovich (Symphony No. 15) and Sofia Gubaidulina (''Stimmenverstummen''). The festival's subtitle and main text is ''Breaking the Chains'' with music by Soviet composers not much in favor at home during the first half of the last century. Some were always well known, some have become so, and others remain nonhousehold names. Tonight at 8, Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406. Tickets are free but must be picked up at the Juilliard box office.  BERNARD HOLLAND    MAYUKO KAMIO Given the notoriously long brunch lines on Manhattan's Upper West Side, it's no surprise that Lincoln Center has found an eager audience for its series of short Sunday morning concerts followed by a reception with the artists. This weekend Mayuko Kamio, a young violinist with a mature temperament and impressive technique, performs a program of popular music by Brahms, Beethoven and Waxman, as well as a new work by Ako Yasuraoka. Sunday at 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $20.  EICHLER    LAHTI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Osmo Vanska, who generated great excitement in his first season as music director of the Minnesota Orchestra and is undoubtedly doing the same in his second, comes calling instead with the Finnish ensemble that put him on the map. (Or was it the reverse? Or both?) You will probably not hear any time soon a more idiomatic and compelling reading of a Sibelius symphony than the performance of the Second here. The program also includes Sibelius's ''Pohjola's Daughter'' and two piano concertos seldom heard in concert, Tchaikovsky's Third and Prokofiev's First, with Louis Lortie as soloist. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $35 to $68.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA As Pierre Boulez nears his 80th birthday, in March, the orchestra is celebrating with him at Carnegie Hall. In the second program, tonight, Mr. Boulez, the most analytical and scientific of conductors, puts Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' on the dissecting table, presenting a discussion illustrated by musical examples played live. It will undoubtedly hold revelations for hardened listeners, as it surely will for novices. In the second half, Mr. Boulez, who has long shown particular mastery of this score, conducts it complete. He leads it again tomorrow but replaces the chat of the first half with performances of his own ''Dérive 2'' and Stravinsky's Symphonies of Wind Instruments. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: tonight, $10 to $35; tomorrow, $27 to $102.  OESTREICH    MET ORCHESTRA James Levine and his Met Orchestra continue their busy Sunday afternoon schedule at Carnegie Hall and bring the splendid bass-baritone José van Dam as guest. He will sing Mozart, Mendelssohn (from ''Elijah'') and three of Mahler's Rückert Lieder. The orchestra continues its mini-tribute to Weber with the Overture to ''Der Freischütz.'' It also indulges Mr. Levine's taste for Webern, with the Symphony, Op. 21, and continues its strong support of Charles Wuorinen, playing his ''Grand Bamboula.'' The afternoon ends with the Dvorak Eighth Symphony, a piece these players did so resplendently a few years back. Sunday at 3 p.m. at Carnegie Hall. (212)247-7800. Tickets: $39 to $155.  HOLLAND    MUSIC OFF THE WALLS This series features thematic concerts by members of the Brooklyn Philharmonic tied to exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum. In the first event of this season, musicians will perform a program titled ''Image and Time,'' with works by Dvorak, Virgil Thomson and Ira Mowitz as well as the premiere of ''Voices from the Gallery'' by the prolific composer Stephen Paulus. The program is designed to complement the museum's exhibition ''About Time: 700 Years of European Painting,'' and a tour of the show is offered before the concert. Ken Selden conducts. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Auditorium, Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $15.  EICHLER    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The Philharmonic's music director, Lorin Maazel, is currently in residence and offers at this week's subscription concerts Honneger's tribute to railroad engineering, ''Pacific 231,'' and Ravel's homage to the ballet and the exotic, the ''Daphnis et Chloé'' complete. Off both these beaten tracks will be Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto with Stephen Hough as pianist. Tomorrow night at 8 at Avery Fisher Hall. (212) 721-6500. Available tickets: $25 to $90.  HOLLAND    PETER ORTH It is unfair to claim that tickets to classical music concerts are prohibitively expensive for most New Yorkers when the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series thrives. Individual tickets are $9, less than you pay for a movie. And the performers who appear are always top-notch, like the pianist Peter Orth, who plays a recital tomorrow night in the inviting auditorium of Washington Irving High School. Since winning first prize at the 1979 Naumburg competition, Mr. Orth has had an active career and made a specialty of dazzling Romantic era repertory. On this program he plays Mendelssohn's tumultuous ''Variations Sérieuses,'' and six pieces from Albéniz's alluring and technically daunting ''Iberia.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street,, Manhattan, (212)586-4680. Tickets: $9, $11.  TOMMASINI    TAKACS QUARTET Decca Records has just released the final installment of this half-Hungarian, half-English ensemble's Beethoven quartet cycle, and to celebrate, the group is performing the complete series at Alice Tully Hall. Its programs mix works from Beethoven's early, middle and late styles. A chronological approach may make more sense for listeners intent on following the composer's journey, but for listeners who aren't taking in the full series, the Takacs's approach has the virtue of showing Beethoven's development in microcosm within each concert. The program tonight includes the works in B-flat (Op. 18, No. 6), C (Op. 59, No. 3) and the final quartet, the F major (Op. 135). On Sunday, the ensemble ends its series with the Quartet in F (Op. 59, No. 1) and a reprise of the Quartet in B flat (Op. 130), which was performed in the opening concert with Beethoven's shorter finale, and will be played here in the version that includes the ''Grosse Fugue'' (Op. 133). Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $30 to $42 tonight; Sunday is sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office.  KOZINN    JOHN ZORN Having presented all of this quirky, inventively eclectic composer's string quartets in early 2003, Miller Theater is keeping up with the cycle by including his latest quartet, called ''Necronomicon,'' as part of a Composer Portrait concert. Included as well is the world premiere of ''Mysterium,'' six-movement work for a mixed ensemble of strings, woodwinds, percussion and electronics. There is never much point guessing what new works by Mr. Zorn will sound like: his influences are so wide-ranging that a work might include several varieties of jazz, klezmer, metal and synagogue chant, all woven together with a sense of evolved gamesmanship. The performers are Tara Helen O'Connor, flutist; Michael Lowenstern and Tim Smith, clarinetists; William Winant, percussionist; June Han, harpist; Stephen Gosling, keyboardist; Jennifer Choi and Jesse Mills, violinists; Richard O'Neill, violist; Fred Sherry, cellist; and Ikue Mori, seeing to the live electronics. Tonight at 8, Miller Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $20; students, $12.

Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.    MARIANA BEKERMAN DANCE COMPANY In ''Shameless,'' Mariana Bekerman, a choreographer born in Odessa, Ukraine, comments on the childlike nature of purity and play. Kevin Keller contributes an original score. The dance episodes range from an evocation of a nightmare to scenes involving mushrooms as phallic symbols and Hula-Hoops as guides. Tonight at 9, tomorrow at 8 p.m., Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (718)445-4028. Tickets: $17.  JACK ANDERSON    BUGLISI/FOREMAN DANCE Jacqulyn Buglisi and Donlin Foreman, two former members of the Martha Graham Dance Company, offer a season of premieres and selected pieces from their varied repertory. Among the new works for their sleek troupe is Ms. Buglisi's ''Conversation,'' the first in a planned series of dances exploring social issues with a taped collage of women's voices from around the world (tonight and Sunday afternoon). Mr. Foreman offers two premieres: ''Gravel Bed,'' a commentary on isolation and humanity's ability to overcome it (also tonight and Sunday afternoon) and ''Dream,'' to a score by David Lang for solo cello, to be played by Maya Beiser (tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon). Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $38.  ANDERSON    COOL NEW YORK 2005 DANCE FESTIVAL Work by 60 dance companies will be showcased in this free two-week festival. If past marathons at this handsome and inviting little studio theater are a guide, any one performance in this first festival weekend will bring you an invigorating mix of the sublime, the professional and the truly terrible, with a couple of great new finds along the way. And the price is certainly right. Tonight at 7 and 9; tomorrow at 2 (family matinee), 7 and 9 p.m.; Sunday at 4 and 6 p.m.; White Wave's John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street, at John Street and the waterfront, under the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn (718)855-8822 or www.whitewavedance.com (information only; no reservations).  JENNIFER DUNNING    E MOTION: NEW ASIAN AMERICAN DANCEWORK This program of all-Japanese hip-hop dance will feature the Bi-TriP troupe, grand champions at Amateur Night at the Apollo. The members fuse hip-hop, jazz, ethnic dance and elements, they say, of mime and illusion. The company directors promise to inspire, entertain and amaze, and we believe them. Tomorrow night at 8, Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Queens, (718)463-7700, Ext. 222, or www.flushingtownhall.com. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    'FOOD FOR THOUGHT' Dancers seems to be among the most generous of artists. This yearly benefit to support neighborhood food distribution programs will feature three presentations of dance, chosen by Miguel Gutierrez (tonight), Nami Yamamoto (tomorrow) and Heidi Latsky (Sunday). Work by eight choreographers under 23 will be presented tonight. Ms. Yamamoto presents work by Linda Austin, Cynthia Oliver, Peter Schmitz and the yummy-sounding Yummy Dance. And Sunday's program features dance by former New Yorkers. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194. Tickets: $10; $5 with two cans of food.  DUNNING    KEELY GARFIELD Ms. Garfield combines a blithe, dark sense of humor and a fascination with knotty emotional issues. In this program of new dances, she examines twins torn asunder and the reckless entrance and tormented exit wounds of love and estrangement. Whew. Today and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $25.  DUNNING    PARALLEL EXIT The company will present ''Powerhouse,'' described as a dance-theater stage cartoon inspired by the films ''City Lights'' and ''An American in Paris,'' and set to music recorded by the jazz ensemble the Raymond Scott Orchestrette.

When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. and in one astonishing small sculpture, a human face splits apart to reveal the ages of man. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  KEN JOHNSON    'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. But whether or not you dig the notion of ''faunal apparel,'' as its organizers refer to outside skins, the show has this to impart: from the moment you encounter the entryway exhibit, a Ziegfeldlike mannequin on a trapeze swing dramatically enveloped by a Roberto Cavalli cascade of pink ostrich feathers, to the outrageous Stephen Jones hat adorned with a crocodile head in the last case, you are on message that fashion is theater, and sometimes theater of the absurd. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65 +, $10; students, $7.  GRACE GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    ROSWELL ANGIER, Gitterman, 170 East 75th Street, (212)734-0868, through Jan. 29. In the early 1970's, this photographer explored a Boston netherworld called the Combat Zone where strip joints and other sex-related businesses flourished. His documentary pictures of strippers and pimps are not sensational but matter-of-fact, tender and sad. A more recent series studying street and bar life in Native American border towns in the Southwest is similarly humane and visually poetic.  JOHNSON    MILTON AVERY: 'ONRUSHING WAVES,' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550, through Jan. 29. The sea was always a painterly challenge for Avery (1885-1965) who saw it as a landscape of forms in endless free motion. This show of his seascapes from the 1920's through the 50's, meant to focus on his treatment of the ocean in its many moods, includes paintings, watercolors and a selection of his sketchbooks recording trips to seaworthy places. The best of the canvases here are the later ones, larger and much closer to abstraction, done in Provincetown summers. ''Onrushing Wave,'' which gives the show its title, is a white field stroked with horizontal dashes of off-blue; in the foreground is a mountainous white crest that confronts the viewer head on, vertically striated with the same blue. At the painting's bottom, rows of tiny blue ripples giver whispering echo to the upheaval above them. These works stay fresh no matter how often you've seen them.  GLUECK    JOEL SHAPIRO, Cook Fine Art, 1063 Madison Avenue, near 81st Street, (212)737-3550, through Feb. 25. This is a fine, economical retrospective of the post-Minimalist sculptor's career. There are not any of the early diminutive houses but there is a small, toy-like bronze horse from 1973-4 that may surprise viewers familiar with Mr. Shapiro's oeuvre. Also on hand are dense, blocky abstract sculptures in painted wood and in bronze and elegant, sumptuous geometric drawings on paper in velvety charcoal and vividly colored pastels.  JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    SUZANNE CAPORAEL: 'READING TIME,' Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, 730 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street, (212)445-0444, through Feb. 12. A very accomplished painter, Ms. Caporael has made even more minimal the elegant painterly means she employs for her landscapes and figures. With poetic use of color, she evokes rather than defines imagery, by means of simple bands and bars of stroked paint. A high point is an evocation of the sea, made by a wonderful orchestration of strokes in various blues and lavenders on a gray ground, by which she brings into being a restlessly heaving body of water. She can can be witty, too, stacking strokes horizontally to produce the image of a personage (male) in a green sweater.  GLUECK    JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212)759-7999, through Feb. 5. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.  JOHNSON    KEITH SONNIER, PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212)421-3292, through Feb. 5. The best new works by this veteran light sculptor consist only of glowing, loosely gestural colored neon lines connected by black wires to small black transformer boxes. They are lovely, but in light of all the new technologies abounding in today's art, there is something quaint about them. You may feel a twinge of nostalgia for a time when neon promised a future far brighter than the one we got.  JOHNSON    'STROKE!' Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, through March 12. Believing that aesthetics trumped politics, the black artists Beauford Delaney, Norman Lewis and Alma Thomas held fast to their commitment to abstraction despite pressure from activists to produce more accessible Social Realism. Brought together here, their paintings from the 1960's and 70's make an arresting combo: Delaney's light-struck canvases, covered with tiny wriggling strokes of luminous colors laid on a solid ground; Lewis's fields of glowing color invaded by ghostly calligraphic forms, Thomas's broken lines of rich color arranged in geometric patterns. The works play off each other to lyrical effect.  GLUECK    'VIEW EIGHT: A FEW DOMESTIC OBJECTS INTERROGATE A FEW WORKS OF ART,' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)752-2929, through Feb. 26. This canny show of artworks and objects of design includes Josiah McElheny's curvy mirrored coffee table bearing mirrored blobby objects; beautiful blobby ceramic sculptures by Ken Price; delicate, biomorphic hanging lights by Leionel Theodore Dean; a twisted, retro-futuristic orange bench by Sachio Hihara; and, like the nightmare that domestic utopianism tries to insulate us from, one of Lee Bontecou's early, scarily militaristic reliefs.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)244-9081, through Feb. 5. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.  JOHNSON    CHARLOTTE BECKET, Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)924-0212, through Feb. 5. Ms. Becket's ''Wishing Well'' is a notable contribution to the department of extreme trash accumulation, kinetic division. Stacked tiers of paper, cardboard, bottles and other sorts of refuse sandwiched between sheets of plywood rise 10 feet in the air. In the middle of this tower of garbage, a vertical conveyor continuously churns up loose debris. It owes a lot to the work of Phoebe Washburn but has its own wacky humor and inventiveness.  JOHNSON    EMILE GUEBEHI AND MALICK SIDIBE, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212)645-1701, through Feb. 5. Lively studio portraits from 40 years and curious new photographs of heavy women seen from behind by Mr. Sidibe, the celebrated photographer from Mali, nicely complement the striking painted sculptures by the Ivory Coast-based Mr. Guebehi. Representing big, buxom women naked or partly naked and, in some cases, visibly pregnant, the sculptures look like the works of a self-taught artist with a thing for maternal women.  JOHNSON    KENT HENRICKSEN: 'SEASON OF DELIGHT,' John Connelly, 526 West 26th Street, (212)337-9563, through Feb. 12. By means of his own embroidery, Mr. Henricksen outfits with hoods, masks and leashes the amorous ladies, swains and cherubs that cavort across swatches of store-bought, faux-Rococo tapestry. His comical additions bring out sadomasochistic shadows obscured by conspiracies of innocence. Purple carpeting and yellow Rococo wallpaper designed by the artist enhance the giddily decadent mood.  JOHNSON    JAMES HYDE; RACHEL BERWICK, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262, through Feb. 5. Mr. Hyde presents rectilinear wall-hung compositions made of raw lumber, chromed steel panels, clear vinyl, paint, photographs and other materials in his continuing, rigorously playful analysis of formalism, materialism and Modernist painting. Ms. Berwick's vivid wall-size video portraits of a rare Galapagos tortoise and a life-size cast in volcanic glass of a tortoise shell obliquely explore the intersection of natural and human histories.  JOHNSON    OAN KIM, The Annex, 601 West 26th Street, (646)638-3785 , through Feb. 5. Two kinds of street photography, both persuasive, are presented in this exhibition of recent work by a Paris-based photographer. In large format, panoramic color prints, the bedazzled, off-kilter, intensely congested urban views suggest a nearly psychedelic disorientation. On the other hand, the more formally ordered, book-size black and white prints depicting mostly abandoned spaces and occasional lone pedestrians project an infectious poetic melancholy.  JOHNSON    CHRISTIAN MARCLAY: 'SHAKE RATTLE AND ROLL (FLUXMIX),' Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through Feb. 5. In an installation by an artist known for hybridizing art and music, each of 16 video monitors in a circle show white-gloved hands gently playing with boxes, books, toys, photographs and other things belonging to a collection of works by Fluxus artists at the Walker Art Center. The various low-level noises produced by the hands and the objects generate a quiet, John Cage-style, surround-sound concert.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    TONY FITZPATRICK: 'THE WONDER: PORTRAITS OF A REMEMBERED CITY,' Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-2144, through Feb. 7. These densely knit concoctions of words and images may be nothing new, but they win you over with their emotion and erudition, both illuminating the greatness of Chicago, as well as their physical solidity. Bristling with an undiluted palette of red, black, white and marigold and dotted with images cut from old matchbook covers as well as poems and personal reminiscences, they conjure up the glamour of bygone hotels, clubs and sports legends while evoking everything from quiltmaking and tattooing to cloisonné and Neo-Expressionism. These works count as highly disciplined exercises in nostalgia: their specificity reveals something new about the time and place they yearn for, as well as the medium they so deftly explore.  ROBERTA SMITH    *'A HEAVENLY CRAFT: THE WOODCUT IN EARLY PRINTED BOOKS,' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212)838-6690, through Feb. 5. A lively overall view of the development of the woodcut is provided by this show of 15th- and 16th-century books acquired in the mid 1940's by Lessing J. Rosenwald, the Sears Roebuck heir, from the noted C.W. Dyson Perrins collection in England. Ranging from primitive to elegant in style, the books -- in themselves works by master printers -- contain illustrations by artists like Albrecht Durer, Urs Graf and Hans Burgkmair along with lesser names and the more frequent anonymities of the period. Among them are three rare editions of Aesop's fables; the ''Revelationes'' of St. Birgitta, produced in 1500 by the Nuremberg printer Anton Koberger and possibly illustrated by Durer himself, and the 1495 Florence folio edition, one of two in existence, of ''Epistolae et Evangeli,'' a book of Gospels and lessons of the Mass that is one of the greatest Florentine illustrated books of the period.  GLUECK    *EVAN SCHWARTZ, Schroeder Romero, 173A North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8992, through Feb. 14. ''Reclaiming Puberty,'' Evan Schwartz's New York solo debut, is a document through photographs of a transition from one gender to another. Arranged chronologically, the series starts with family snapshots of the artist as a pre-adolescent girl dressed in a oversized man's tweed jacket and as a sultry teenager in a floor-length gown on her way to a high school prom. Then the pictures change fast as Mr. Evans physically begins to assume a male identity, through a regiment of horomone treatments and a double mastectomy. Celebratory in spirit, the show ends with a second prom photo. In this one, Mr. Schwartz, handsome in a tux, has his arms around a young woman, his date.  COTTER    PINAR YOLACAN: 'PERISHABLES,' Rivington Arms, 102 Rivington Street, between Essex and Ludlow Streets, (646)654-3213, through Feb. 6. Ms. Yolacan's provocatively discomfiting large photographs portray elderly women in carefully tailored off-white blouses, sweaters or scarves made wholly or partly of raw animal flesh -- tripe and chicken skin, mainly -- purchased from butchers. You can read her pictures as unusually visceral feminist poems about fashion and mortality.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    ROZ CHAST: 'SEASON'S GREETINGS,' Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)627-2410, closing tomorrow. For her first New York gallery exhibition, this brilliant cartoonist presents recent cartoons, many of which have appeared in The New Yorker, and a set of eggs brightly painted according to a traditional Ukrainian craft. The eggs bearing images of funny-looking people are amusing, but they don't compete with the cartoons' hilarious and uncannily acute take on the conflicted psychic life of ordinary, white, liberal Americans.  JOHNSON    JAMES GILLRAY, New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212)869-8089, through tomorrow. One of the most popular cartoonists of his day, Gillray (1756-1815) produced lively, hand-colored etchings that lampooned major public figures like the king, the queen and Napoleon, and many minor ones, too. At his best, Gillray's draftsmanly skill and visionary imagination puts him in a league with artists like William Blake, James Ensor and R. Crumb. Hours: Today and tomorrow, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: Free.  KEN JOHNSON    KEITH HARING, Alona Kagan, 540 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)560-0670, closing tomorrow. If you liked the New Museum's lively survey of the East Village scene of the 1980's, you will appreciate this selection of paintings and sculptures by one of the best artists to emerge from that cauldron of antic creativity. It includes subway drawings in chalk on black paper; large, dizzyingly patterned canvases and brightly enameled, cut-metal characters. Barking dogs, radiant babies, flying saucers, mythic monsters and all kinds of hyperactive humans animate Haring's delirious cosmic comedy.
