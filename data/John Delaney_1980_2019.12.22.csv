ERIC ANDERSEN, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. Since the 1960's, Eric Andersen has been picking his guitar and singing about love in wistfully graceful songs like ''Thirsty Boots'' and ''Blue River.'' Now, with a deeper, rougher voice, he has started to reflect about the passing decades; the title track of his new double album, ''Beat Avenue'' (Appleseed), is a 26-minute story over a jazz vamp about Beat poets on Nov. 22, 1963. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30, with Lisa Cornelio opening; admission is $20 (Jon Pareles).",https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/07/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-651583.html,,A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.,The New York Times,[],[],2003-03-07T05:00:00+0000,article,"Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk",Movies,,Schedule,nyt://article/2fa75307-bc4f-5f6d-808e-a51fa493d83e,2524,nyt://article/2fa75307-bc4f-5f6d-808e-a51fa493d83e,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,,,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,,,,,[],,E,6

Beat Science is a septet from Boston, with Brian Carpenter on slide trumpet, Jim Hobbs on alto saxophone and Charlie Kohlhaase on baritone saxophone; it's a loose-limbed jazz group involving conducting of improvisers. Joe Morris's staccato, small-gesture guitar improvising was unique in the late 80's, when he started to get a little bit of attention, and remains that way today; his current band includes the remarkable bassist Timo Shanko and the drummer Luther Gray. Those sets are Sunday at 9 and 10; a four-band bill begins at 7.
