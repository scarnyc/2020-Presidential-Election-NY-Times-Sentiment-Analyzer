0," Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.    Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'WORK' Opens tomorrow. Corporations take another beating in this satire of the cubicled life. Directed by Jim Simpson (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407.    'B.F.E.' Opens Tuesday. A kooky Asian-American family tries to escape its stifling home life, while a serial killer stalks its neighborhood in Arizona (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Opens Wednesday. Elaine May's three one-acts make up a new comedy on Broadway (remember those?) about married couples and aging singles looking for love. It's being called a play ''about life in the new millennium.'' Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.    'BIRDIE BLUE' Previews start Thursday. Opens June 23. S. Epatha Merkerson stars as the title character in this memory play about a woman whose life changed tragically on the day that Martin Luther King Jr. was killed (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422.    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Opens June 15. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Renew that old debate at Tom Donaghy's new adaptation of Chekhov's last play (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.  'THE CONSTANT WIFE' Previews start today. Opens June 16. When a wife discovers that her husband is cheating with her best friend, she takes unusual measures. Roundabout's revival of Somerset Maugham's comedy of manners stars Kate Burton and Lynn Redgrave (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300.    'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens late May/early June. The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show. David Warren directs (1:25). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.    'MANUSCRIPT' Previews start Wednesday. Opens June 12. A manuscript holds the key to success and fame in Paul Grellong's comedy, directed by Bob Balaban (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200.    'THE PARIS LETTER' Opens June 12. A repressed Wall Street investment banker (is there any other kind?) has a long, hard fall in Jon Robin Baitz's new drama, which spans four decades (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212)719-1300.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. (Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about a girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking and ambitious play (starring Tim Daly), but unfortunately, there are no characters in it you can believe in (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    *'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play, displaying traces of David Mamet and Quentin Tarantino, packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman)    *'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the pair (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, (212)279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MORTAL LADIES POSSESSED' Linda Marlowe's admirable but difficult one-woman show is based on a 1974 collection of Tennessee Williams's short stories. The adaptation is sometimes awkward and the transitions hard to follow, but Ms. Marlowe captures the characters' pathos and fragility nicely (1:20). 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Anita Gates)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics is badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)    'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer, Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. The show is in repertory with ''Songs From an Unmade Bed.'' (Anne Midgette)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. In repertory with ''Score.'' (Midgette)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Preyskyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters, affecting but derivative music, humor that ranges from tired to classic, too much sentiment and just enough irreverence, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, (212)239-6200. (Gates)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'KNOCK ON WOOD' Thanks to Steven Spielberg and Bob Dole, the bar is fairly high these days for war stories, and Samuel Calderon comes nowhere near clearing it with ''Knock on Wood,'' a monologue about his perfectly ordinary service in the Israeli military during the Yom Kippur War. He sees a few moderately distressing sights, his friend is injured, and that's about it (1:30). 13th Street Repertory, 50 West 13th Street, (212)352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'UNCLE JIMMY'S DIRTY BASEMENT' This strange brew of Catskills humor, heavy metal and filthy-minded puppets has developed a cult following downtown, and its bizarre band rocks out to some of the most bombastically silly songs since Spinal Tap's ''Big Bottom.'' But when the music stops, the show meanders without an involving story (1:15). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)477-5288. ( Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE FALL' Through Kenneth Nowell's looking glass, Hamlet is reversed, and a daughter, Jill, is driven mad by her mother's ghost. Was the mother's expected death natural or an act of murder by her father, who too quickly married her mother's sister? A strong cast and superb director, Kate Marks, manage a tone that teeters effectively between the tragic and the hilarious, and one is left unexpectedly shaken (1:40). The Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212)307-9467, closing on Sunday. (Honor Moore)    'KING A' Het Laagland's variation on the legend of King Arthur for children features five energetic actors, 40 tiny chairs, several a cappella musical numbers, occasional swordplay and frequent inspiring affirmations. The show is inventive and full of physical energy, but in the end may be a little too talky for its intended audience (1:20.) New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'MEMORY HOUSE' Dianne Wiest's warm, engaging performance provides the juicy filling in Kathleen Tolan's play about a tense standoff between a mother and her teenage daughter over their differing philosophies of life. As she bakes a pie -- from scratch, mind you -- Ms. Wiest performs the still more challenging feat of keeping our sympathies keenly attuned to the appealing emotional undercurrents in Ms. Tolan's slight but sensitively drawn two-hander (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    *'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    *'THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD' Working off a template popularized by Anna Deveare Smith, this engaging, smart and scrupulously balanced docudrama is an oral history of the gentrification of Carroll Gardens. Deanna Pacelli convincingly portrays an F Train full of ethnic types who document how the neighborhood moved from crack to baguettes (1:00). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at East Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288, closing on Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes) Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick is a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DOMINION PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST' (R, 115 minutes) The solemn, high-minded attempt to redeem ''The Exorcist'' franchise is the movie equivalent of retrieving the eggshells, coffee grounds and banana peels from the trash and presenting them as art; the ingredients still stink. (Holden)    *'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    *'FUNNY HA HA' (Not rated, 89 minutes) Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)    *'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    *'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creep show, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'JIMINY GLICK IN LALAWOOD' (R, 90 minutes) This frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character is an intermittently funny free-for-all that suffers from attention deficit disorder. (Holden)    'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)    'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in. (Dargis)    'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    *'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MA MÈRE' (NC-17, 110 minutes, in French) Avid sensation-seeking in this film is such a grim affair that after a short while, the spectacle of its aimless characters bending themselves out of shape in the pursuit of depravity mutates from titillating to pathetic to laughable. (Holden)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MINDHUNTERS' (R, 106 minutes) This thriller reimagines Agatha Christie's ''Ten Little Indians'' as ''Eight Little Profilers'': a team of would-be F.B.I. agents, isolated at a training compound to solve a simulated crime, soon realize that a real serial killer walks among them. The film may find a cult audience among fans of schlock cinema seeking a giggle and a scream. (Dana Stevens)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    *'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL: THE JOURNEY OF ROMÉO DALLAIRE' (no rating, 91 minutes) The unsettling documentary follows Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire, the Canadian commander of the tiny United Nations peacekeeping force stationed in Rwanda in 1994 as he returns to that African country 10 years after mass slaughter of 800,000 during his watch. (Holden) 'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    '6IXTYNIN9' (R, 118 minutes) The Thai director Pen-ek Ratanarjuang's propulsive black comedy follows an unemployed secretary (Lalita Panyopas) as she struggles to begin a new life with money stolen from a local gangster. Despite drama-school performances and clear signs of budget constraint (most of the action takes place inside the same modest apartment), ''6ixtynin9'' ramps up the body count with energy, wit and a sustained awareness of the economically depressed world outside the frame. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    *'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    *'3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean) A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)    *'TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE' (R, 95 minutes) This intimate portrait of the legendary octogenarian cinematographer Haskell Wexler, filmed by his son, is an artistic father-son power struggle for control of a movie being made. It is the richest documentary of its kind since Terry Zwigoff's ''Crumb.'' (Holden)    *'À TOUT DE SUITE' (Not rated, 96 minutes; in French) This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)    '2009 LOST MEMORIES' (R, 136 minutes; in Korean and Japanese) A beautifully designed and ambitious example of Korean cinema, this film confronts the political and racial enmity between Korea and Japan with astonishing directness and originality. Blending action, time travel and heartfelt drama, the film posits a future in which Japan has conquered Korea and won World War II. (Catsoulis)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)    'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (né O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis)    Film Series    THE BEST OF THE AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through Tuesday) BAMcinematek's festival schedule includes ''Dirt for Dinner'' (2000), from Nigeria and Germany, about the first black German policeman, who turned to crime; ''Madame Brouette'' (2002), a feminist melodrama from Senegal; and ''Soldiers of the Rock'' (2003), about miners in South Africa. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100; $10. (Anita Gates)    EYE AND EAR CONTROLLED (Through June 11) The Anthology Film Archives' three-week series of rare music films continues with George Manupelli's ''Ride Dr. Chicago Ride'' tonight; ''Cry Dr. Chicago'' and a program of videos by Robert Ashley tomorrow night; and three Michael Snow films, including ''Rameau's Nephew,'' on Sunday.

At 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400; $10; 65+, $8; students, $6. (Gates)    FRANÇOIS OZON RETROSPECTIVE (Through June 5) The Museum of the Moving Image is honoring Mr. Ozon, the genre-bending French director of ''Swimming Pool'' and ''Under the Sand.'' The event closes with a personal appearance by Mr. Ozon. At 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077. Museum admission: $10; 65+ and students, $7.50. (Gates)    'MICHAEL POWELL: BEAUTY UNENDING' (Through Tuesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's major centennial tribute to this British director continues through the end of the month. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600. Tickets: $10; students, $7; members, $6; children and 65+, $5. (Stevens)    'THE TWO OF US' (Through June 9) Film Forum is showing Claude Berri's 1967 classic about a Jewish boy in occupied France. Alain Cohen plays the boy, and Michel Simon the elderly man with whom he is sent to the country to live. This is a new 35-millimeter print with new subtitles, to be shown with Mr. Berri's Oscar-winning 1962 short, ''Le Poulet,'' about a boy and his rooster. At 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8110. Tickets: $10; members, $5. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ALVIN YOUNGBLOOD HART (Thursday). Syncopated fingerpicking and a sly rasp of a voice show Alvin Youngblood Hart's blues roots, but there's no telling which way he'll decide to stretch them with his band Muscle Theory. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155. $18 in advance; $20 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    *BEENIE MAN, VYBZ KARTEL (Saturday) Two of dancehall reggae's biggest names come to town for what should be a manic, exuberant night of shouting and singing, by turns silly and ferocious. Vybz Kartel specializes in witty, rapid-fire narratives, whereas Beenie Man is less single-minded: an astonishingly versatile performer, he can go from a pop sing-along to an a cappella sex rhyme to an infectious dance track in a matter of minutes -- and often does. 10 p.m., Elite Ark, 900 Sheffield Avenue, at Wortman Avenue, Canarsie, Brooklyn, (718)649-6535. $40 in advance sold out; only $50 tickets left. (Kelefa Sanneh)    BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Wednesday) Boasting zero members from Brazil and only one girl (the multilingual surrealist jazz singer Sabina Sciubba), this downtown quartet, arising from the arty Nublu club scene, plays its erotic, electronica-inflected reggae and bossa novas on keyboards, computers, bass and drums. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800. $20; $25 at the door. (Laura Sinagra)    RICHARD BUCKNER (Tuesday) Women and booze keep letting Richard Buckner down, and his glum, scuffed-up voice is just right for songs that bring together the depressive sides of honky-tonk country and singer-songwriter confessionals. 7:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)420-1466. $10; $12 at the door. (Pareles)    CORDERO (Tomorrow) Mixing the open atmospherics of the Southwest with the gritty feel of the Brooklyn art scene, the bilingual Ani Cordero, who has worked with Calexico and Giant Sand, and her band make guitar rock that gives urban brashness some borderland mystery. 11:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. $10. (Sinagra)    CHARANGA SOLEIL (Tonight) Pulling together an Afro-Caribbean diaspora, Charanga Soleil mixes the courtly Cuban charanga (for a group including flute and violin) with touches of Congolese guitar rumba, West African kora, Haitian rara drumming and more. The band was assembled by Al Angeloro, a longtime world-music disc jockey. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155. $15. (Pareles)    CURLEY TAYLOR & ZYDECO TROUBLE (Saturday) The accordionist Curley Taylor modernizes his Louisiana two-steps with hints of funk in the rhythm and rhythm-and-blues in the vocals, singing ''country boy, city thoughts.'' A Let's Zydeco show, with dance lessons at 7 p.m., live music at 8. La Belle Epoque, 827 Broadway, above 12th Street, (212)685-7597 or (212)254-6436. $18. (Pareles)    EDMAR CASTAÑEDA (Tonight and Tomorrow) The Colombian harp was not often heard in a jazz context until Mr. Castañeda, a teenage prodigy, began nudging its limits in the mid-90's. 8 and 10 p.m. and 12 a.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-3626. $20. (Sinagra)    FREESTYLE FEVER (Sunday) This party celebrates freestyle, the homegrown Latin pop genre that flourished in the 1980's but still hasn't -- thank goodness -- gone away. Headliners are to include K7 featuring TKA, Lisette Melendez and the former Sweet Sensation singer Betty. (Visit copacabanany.com for the complete lineup.) 10 p.m., the Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-2672. $25 in advance; more at the door. (Sanneh)    DARK STAR ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Tomorrow) You never know which full Grateful Dead live set this cover band will perform until the show gets under way. Fans informally compete in guessing the original date and site. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800. $26.50; $30 at the door. (Sinagra)    DB AND STAKKA (Tomorrow) The drum 'n' bass DJ DB was a popularizer of hard, breakbeat techno, founding a label and record store dedicated to this pulverizing, ominous micro-genre. 10 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)475-7088, or www.rothkonyc.com, $10. (Sinagra)    EDAN (Tuesday) The Boston indie rap polymath Edan distinguishes himself by doing it all -- DJ-ing, rapping and creating his own sample-based tracks that pay homage to late-80's hip-hop. The Other Music record store brings him into town for a performance and extended DJ set. 9 p.m. to 4 a.m., APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)414-4245. $5.(Sinagra)    *ROBBIE FULKS (Wednesday) The latest album of curveball Chicago country by Robbie Fulks once again prompts head shaking as to why this off-off-Opry wiseacre isn't a more famous songwriter (or at least a little bigger and richer). As alt-country fans know, he's a crackerjack guitarist and a charismatic performer to boot. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. $10; $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    GLASS CANDY (Tonight) With a name that brilliantly recalls suburbia's deadliest home décor, these theatrical Portland no-wavers appropriately perform their fractured dance music in Lit's hipster dungeon. 9 p.m., Lit Lounge, 93 Second Avenue, near Fifth Street, East Village, (212)777-7987. $6. (Sinagra)    GOLDIE LOOKIN' CHAIN (Monday) If the idea of eight puerile Ali G dress-alikes rapping about whose mother has a penis appeals, these cheeky Welshmen deliver, slinging silly rhymes over thin, ironic beats. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. $15; $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    JUAN LUIS GUERRA (Tonight and Saturday) This Dominican merengue superstar guitarist has also gained fame as a sometimes controversial populist spokesman on Latin American social issues. Increasingly, his music has incorporated Afropop rhythms into the traditional merengue form. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741. $59.50-99.50.(Sinagra)    HALLUCINOGEN ( Tonight) Since the 1999 release of ''Twisted'' (Twisted), a hallmark of electronica's psychotropic Goa trance style, Hallucinogen's Simon Posford has moved further into a slicker, more cleanly produced brand of dance dub. 10 p.m., Spirit, 530 West 27th, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. $30. (Sinagra)    MIHO HATORI, SHOT'NEZ, WHITE HASSLE (Tomorrow) Hatori, former vocalist for the experimental popists Cibo Matto, has a new solo record. Shot'nez finds members of Gogol Bordello, Firewater and Big Lazy boogie-ing at the crossroads of the American South and the Middle East.

(Sinagra)    *THE HOLD STEADY (Tomorrow) This great Brooklyn band is to celebrate its great new album, ''Separation Sunday'' (French Kiss), with a free concert in a Williamsburg record shop; arrive early, so you can see Craig Finn's face while he delivers his sly but urgent rants over 1970's-era riff-rock. 3 p.m., Sound Fix, 110 Bedford Avenue, at North 11th Street, (718)388-8090. Free. (Sanneh)    *THE HOMOSEXUALS (Monday and Tuesday) Though this seminal London band's stylistic forays placed them on a par with other polestars of 70's and 80's British art punk, they never rose to name-drop prominence. Last year's three-disc compilation of everything they ever recorded (they never released a full-length LP) gave them some deserved due. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)420-1466. $15; $18 at the door. Tuesday at 11 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)475-7088 or www.rothkonyc.com. $10. (Sinagra)    JULIETTE & THE LICKS (Saturday) Rilo Kiley's Jennie Lewis isn't the only child actress named Lewis reinventing herself as a rocker. The ''Cape Fear'' and ''Natural Born Killers'' star Juliette is having a ball touring with rock festivals and screeching girl-power anthems in the Courtney Love vein. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. $13 to $15. (Sinagra)    *RILO KILEY, PORTASTATIC (Tonight) This band combines the expansive American longing for Bruce Springsteen with the bedroom introspection of early Liz Phair. The frontwoman Jennie Lewis's humanized star power makes for a surprisingly explosive live show. The Superchunk leader Mac MacCaughan's long-standing side project Portastatic opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600. $18; $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    *KRAFTWERK (Wednesday) Back in the 1970's, four German rockers billed themselves as ''the man-machine.'' They abandoned standard instruments for blipping synthesizers and ticking synthetic drums and sang in determinedly emotionless voices about the robotic pleasures of the modern world. They returned in the late 90's to capitalize on the techno scene they helped inspire, and they have recast their old songs from analog to digital. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)564-4882. $45; $47 day of. (Pareles)    LADYBUG (Tonight) The soothing yet strong female rapper from the groovy mid-90's ''hip-hop bebop'' group Digable Planets will release a solo album before her old trio tries a reunion later this year. The new songs by this mother of four are tinged with Afro-Brazilian rhythms and speak of spiritual struggle. 11 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132. $15. (Sinagra)    LOUIS THE XIV (Thursday) Like the metal parodists the Darkness, this energetic San Diego band riffs on glam-rock excess for hipster fans who find the group's anthems to flagrant groupie sex as hilarious as Spinal Tap. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-5252. $16; $18 at the door.(Sinagra)    KYP MALONE, KIM AND MATT (Tonight) With his ethereal falsetto and coronal afro, Kyp Malone is known to many as a vocalist-guitarist in the spacy New York group TV on the Radio. For years, though, he was a fixture in San Francisco's indie scene. Lately he's been doing his own thing. The poppers Kim and Matt fill out the bill. 8 p.m., Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077. $10. (Sinagra)    LEO NOCENTELLI, ZIGABOO MODELISTE, ROBERT WALTER AND DOUG WIMBISH (Tonight) Leo Nocentelli has been scratching the backbeat and teasing the blues for decades as the guitarist in the Meters, the great New Orleans funk band. He's jamming here with the Meters drummer Zigaboo Modeliste, the Greyboy All-Stars jazz funk keyboardist Robert Walter and the Living Color bassist and dub artist Doug Wimbish. 10:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)997-4144. $20. (Pareles)    PLAID (Thursday) A ''laptop set'' from the British duo of Ed Handley and Andy Turner, purveyors of the opaque, at times aloof, techno associated with the once seminal Warp label. Their experience making cerebral electronic music stretches back to membership in the influential mid-90's act Black Dog Productions. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)475-7088, or www.rothkonyc.com $20. (Sinagra)    *THE RAVEONETTES (Tuesday) Clearing away the garage noise of its debut, this Danish duo strives for pure 60's pop classicism. Its new album incorporates rock history, from girl groups to surf rock to punk, as well as historic rock in the form of cameos by Ronnie Spector, Suicide's Martin Rev and the Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, (201)653-1703. $15; sold out.

This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    *SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW: HILLA REBAY AND SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim Museum's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering, 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    *QUEEN SOFíA SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Núñez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquín Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture, and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY-15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!: SELF-TAUGHT ARTISTS, THE BIBLE AND THE AMERICAN SOUTH,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, Minnie Evans, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Smith)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    *STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI: 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)    THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    ANTHONY CARO Four tabletop pieces from the 1970's and 80's, masterly exercises in balletic form and balance in rusting steel, by this reigning British standard-bearer of modernist abstract sculpture. They are elegant and a serious pleasure. Mitchell-Inness & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11.(Kimmelman)    *'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, through June 4. (Cotter)    JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through June 4. (Johnson)    *RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson)    LARRY RIVERS Boldly setting up as a figural painter in the holy days of Abstract Expressionism, Rivers (1923-2002) early on produced portraits, nudes and takeoffs on historical events, like his sendup of the corny 19th-century painting by Emanuel Leutze, ''Washington Crossing the Delaware.'' This bulging retrospective covers work from the early 1950's to his death, ending with the rather forgettable fashion images of his last years. At his best, he was a painter to reckon with. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212)541-4900; Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212)463-8634, through June 4. (Glueck)    AIDA RUILOVA: 'LETS GO' A participant in the last Whitney Biennial and P.S. 1's current ''Greater New York,'' Ms. Ruilova makes short and briefly gripping multi-screen video works in a style you might call Neo-Goth Surrealistic Cubism. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)445-0444, through June 4. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    TINA BARNEY The photographer known for her large, sumptuous color photographs of rich people often caught in situations of subtle psychological tension presents portraits shot in Spain and Germany that are included in her book ''The Europeans.'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212)431-0166, closing June 4. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)    IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, (212)206-3583, through June 4. (Smith)    CHERYL DONEGAN: 'OLD, TEMPORARY' While video-projected images of colorful, cheap toys unfold on the wall, a woman's maniacally cheerful voice recites a rapid-fire litany of affirmations composed for Amway salespeople: ''I am the best at what I do. There is no one better. I get the job done,'' and so on. It is funny and scary. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through June 4. (Johnson)    ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)    NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree branches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)    RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by the influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through June 18. (Johnson)    MICHAEL RYAN Using his training in the art of decorative marbleizing, this self-taught painter creates dreamy, primordial landscapes sparsely populated by bizarrely abstracted animals and people. Together, the brushy painting and the visionary imagery create a scary, feverish feeling. Andrew Edlin, 529 West 20th Street, (212)206-9723, through June 4. (Johnson)    'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)    STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotum-like coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through June 18. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    *MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a recreation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    *ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25.(Johnson)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    *WYNNE GREENWOOD AND K8 HARDY Wynne Greenwood is best known as the one-person rock trio called Tracy and the Plastics. K8 Hardy is a founder of the gay feminist art collective LTTR. For this show, they collaborated on a video called ''New Report'' in which they play anchorwomen for an alternative television news channel. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, through June 5. (Cotter)    JUDY LEDGERWOOD: 'SPRING FEVER' With a boldly insouciant touch and vibrantly dissonant colors, this Chicago-based artist makes grid-based pattern paintings using heraldic overtones and punchy mandala compositions of squished balloonlike shapes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)229-2757, through June 24. (Johnson)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through October. (Johnson)    *AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous, dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations of texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)    DON SUNSERI: 'PIECES FOR A WALL' The appealing small painted and sculpted abstractions made out of found pieces of wood, metal and cardboard in this one-wall exhibition look like the result of a collaboration between Elizabeth Murray and Richard Tuttle. It is interesting to learn that Sunseri, who died in 2001, was once married to Ms. Murray. The Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)614-0505, through June 16. (Johnson)    Last Chance    'ALEXANDER THE GREAT: TREASURES FROM AN EPIC ERA OF HELLENISM,' Alexander (356-323 B.C.) and his age are evoked in this concentrated show of art and artifacts displaying portrait busts of this legendary Macedonian emperor, ancient coins, advanced Macedonian weaponry and pottery. Onassis Cultural Center, 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)486-4448, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)    VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' This video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)462-2668, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    'EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY' Among more than 70 narrative paintings, drawings and prints by a wide range of 20th-century artists are works by Max Beckmann, James Ensor, John Heartfield, KatheKollwitz, Sue Coe, Martha Rosler and Eric Fischl. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212)245-6734, closing today. (Johnson)    AMY GARTRELL: 'HOT HANDS, COLD HEART' The tribulations and infatuations of youth are the subjects of drawings, felt banners and an installation involving faceted glass charms and a lugubrious tree that would have done Edward Gorey proud. Daniel Reich, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)924-4949, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    JAMES GOBEL: 'RIDICULE IS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF' Fat Rococo-era fops pose on a striped floor against a background of snow-covered rocky peaks in a campy, mural-scale confection made of neatly assembled pieces of colored felt. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)352-2238, closing today. (Johnson)    *JACK GOLDSTEIN A hero of the Pictures generation revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. His films from the early 70's (from 20 seconds to 5 minutes long) have a cool, deadpan quality recalling early videos of William Wegman. Ed Ruscha-style paintings of lightning storms from the 80's, here and at Metro, are thrillingly cinematic. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, closing today. (Johnson)    TERAO KATSUHIRO, SHINKI TOMOYUKI, YOSHIMUNE KAZUHIRO, YUMOTO MITSUO Four artists, from a Japanese center for the artistically talented but mentally disabled, appear possessed of naïve but intense imaginations and formal predilections bordering on compulsive. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, SoHo, (212)925-1200, closing on Tuesday. (Johnson)    'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)243-3159, closing today. (Smith)    *METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS' Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, closing on Monday. (Kimmelman)    MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST' Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND' A generally stellar midcareer survey of this 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400, closing on Monday.(Kimmelman)    ADAM PENDLETON: 'DEEPER DOWN THERE' This young conceptualist lifts verbal phrases from modern African-American literature and music and neatly silkscreens them onto single-color canvases, creating a coolly provocative blend of romantic poetry, identity politics and formalist abstraction. Yvon Lambert, 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-3611, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    *WAYNE THIEBAUD: 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery, thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, closing today. (Johnson)    QIU SHIHUA: 'INSIGHT' At first, the canvases by this painter from Shenzhen, China, look like nothing more than slightly scuffed expanses of raw fabric. Look again and you discover peaceful, luminously misty landscapes realized with amazing subtlety. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)414-1169, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JOHN F. SIMON JR.: 'ENDLESS VICTORY' Mesmerizing animated patterns driven by sophisticated software programs and running on laptop screens; they would make excellent screen savers. One plays inventive variations on Mondrian's ''Victory Boogie Woogie.'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646)336-7183, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JOAN WALLACE, 'VIOLENT POP PAINTINGS' Each of three videos set into white monochrome panels shows a white-frosted cake exploded in slow motion by a shotgun blast. Ms. Wallace invites us to read this as a commentary on Modernist purity, the shooting of Andy Warhol and the assassination of President Kennedy. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)947-2818, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' closing on Sunday. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Kimmelman)    'WILDER' This tribute to the Los Angeles dealer Nicholas Wilder (1937-1989) presents works by 28 artists who were shown at his gallery from 1965 to 1979. The all-star lineup includes Dan Flavin, Agnes Martin, John McCracken, Richard Tuttle and Cy Twombly. Parrasch and Washburn galleries, 20 West 57th Street, (212)246-5360 and (212)246-5300, closing today.

2," The singer and guitarist TAJ MAHAL is unpredictable: obsessed with roots (in blues, reggae, Malian and Hawaiian music, among other things), but no purist. He has crossed over into ill-advised aesthetic zones at times over the last 40 years and lost some of his audience along the way. But he is a strong musician and a magnetic performer who leans into a song, drives it hard, wills it to work; the more stripped-down the setting, the easier it is to appreciate his gift. At the moment he's touring with just a trio, and it's a good moment to hear him. Blue Note, 131 West 3rd Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, $30 cover at the bar, $45 cover at a table.    The BOREDOMS, led by the singer EYE YAMATAKA, started in the late 80's in Kyoto, Japan. Initially they made loud, spastic, sputtering music, strengthened by a little artful tape-editing on record and enlivened by karatelike movements on stage. Cleverly mixing well-prepared music and chaos, they could create stupefaction in an audience, which explains why the likes of SONIC YOUTH and JOHN ZORN became such fans. In the mid-90's they shifted gears, stretching songs out to 30 minutes or more, going for the drone, with chanting and thunderous drumming, and became powerfully effective at that, too. They're still fully committed to the cresting-and-ebbing strategy: one of the two long tracks on their new album ''SEADRUM/HOUSE OF SUN'' (Vice), their first in five years, was partly recorded on the beach, with the tide gradually washing into the bass drum. The current lineup, with Mr. Eye singing and playing electronics in front of the drummers YOSHIMI, ATR, and YOJIRO, arrives at the BOWERY BALLROOM on Wednesday, on a bill with JIM O'ROURKE and GROWING.

He has crossed over into ill-advised aesthetic zones at times over the last 40 years and lost some of his audience along the way. But he is a strong musician and a magnetic performer who leans into a song, drives it hard, wills it to work; the more stripped-down the setting, the easier it is to appreciate his gift.

Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'TERRORISM' Opens Monday. A jet black and ominous comedy about modern Russian life that weaves together six interconnected scenes set everywhere from an airport runway to a lover's bedroom. Written by the Siberian brothers Vladimir and Oleg Presnyakov (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200.    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Opens Tuesday. Seventeen composers each wrote one song to go with the lyrics of Mark Campbell for this solo show about the heartaches and successes of a gay New Yorker. In repertory with ''Score'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200.    'THE ARGUMENT' Opens Wednesday. Trouble in a relationship reaches its climax in this world premiere by Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of ''Omnium Gatherum'' (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303.    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' Opens Thursday.A musical based on the infamous 1920's murder inspired by the philosophy of Nietzsche. Sounds like a joke, but doesn't seem to be (1:30). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, (212) 868-444.    'TABLOID CALIGULA' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Thursday. A comedy about a small-time criminal in the unforgiving underworld, part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street (212) 279-4200.    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Opens June 1. Elaine May's three one-acts is a new comedy on Broadway (remember those?) about married couples and aging singles looking for love. It's being called a play ''about life in the new millennium.'' Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.    'B.F.E.' Opens May 31. A kooky Asian-American family tries to escape its stifling home life, while a serial killer stalks its neighborhood in Arizona (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd (212) 279-4200.    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Previews start Wednesday. Opens June 15. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Renew that old debate at Tom Donaghy's new adaptation of Chekhov's last play. (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street (212) 239-6200.    'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens late May/early June. The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show. David Warren directs (1:25). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'THE PARIS LETTER' Opens June 12. A repressed Wall Street investment banker (is there any other kind?) has a long, hard fall in Jon Robin Baitz's new drama that spans four decades (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300.    'WORK' Opens May 28. Corporations take another beating in this satire of the cubicled life. Directed by Jim Simpson (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street (212) 226-2407.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish wind-up music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us. (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at East 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)    'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking and ambitious play (starring Tim Daly) but unfortunately there's no characters in it you can believe in (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'KING A' Het Laagland's variation on the legend of King Arthur for children features five energetic actors, 40 tiny chairs, several a cappella musical numbers, occasional swordplay and frequent inspiring affirmations. The show is inventive and full of physical energy but in the end may be a little too talky for its intended audience (1:20.) New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the two maids (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, (212)279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MEMORY HOUSE' Dianne Wiest's warm, engaging performance provides the juicy filling in Kathleen Tolan's play about a tense stand-off between a mother and her teenage daughter over their differing philosophies of life. As she bakes a pie -- from scratch, mind you -- Ms. Wiest performs the still more challenging feat of keeping our sympathies keenly attuned to the appealing emotional undercurrents in Ms. Tolan's slight but sensitively drawn two-hander (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side-effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)    'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics gets badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. ( Zinoman)    'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village. (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' The comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'THE FALL' Through Kenneth Nowell's looking glass, Hamlet is reversed, and a daughter; Jill is driven mad by her mother's ghost. Was the mother's expected death natural or an act of murder by her father, who too quickly married her mother's sister? A strong cast and superb director, Kate Marks, manage a tone that teeters effectively between the tragic and the hilarious, and one is left unexpectedly shaken (1:40). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, (212)307-9467). (Honor Moore)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'LES BELLES SOEURS' There is a good John Waters movie hiding inside Michel Tremblay's all-female play. This likable comedy about a New England woman who wins a million trading stamps wants to be a farce but is just a collection of observations searching for a shape (1:30). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)330-8650, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'CHANTECLER' A version of Edmond Rostand's fable about a rooster and his role in the cosmos bills itself as a family show, but it's pitched way over the heads of the age group that would most enjoy its colorful costumes. But Cory Einbinder, the director, manages to make a smattering of scenes memorable: a parade of mutant roosters; a ridiculous trio of toads (2:20). Teatro La Tea, at Clemente Soto Valez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, second floor, (212)353-3101, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'JAPANESE PLAYS FROM THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY' The sole reason to see this evening of three one-acts is the rare staging of ""Paper Balloon,"" by Kunio Kishida, one of Japan's most important pre-World War II dramatists. The rest of the program is embarrassingly misconceived (2:00) . Common Basis Theater, 750 Eighth Avenue, room 500, (646)554-6557, closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb)    'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    * 'LOVE/LIFE A LIFE IN SONG' The year's finest cabaret act has expanded into a brilliant 90-minute concert for the theater in which Brian Stokes Mitchell sustains a remarkable fusion of pop-jazz singing and theatrical expression. A must (1:30). Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, (212) 239-6200, closing on Monday. (Stephen Holden)    * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women (1:25). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR' Henry Adam's play starts out as a humorous, trenchant fable on how fear of terrorism can distort individual lives, not to say nations, but something mysterious happens after intermission: it mutates into a sitcom. The actors Ronny Jhutti and Mark McDonnell are very much worth watching, though. Part of Brits Off Broadway (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE PURSUIT OF PERSEPHONE' A musical inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's college romance with Ginevra King jams 26 songs into two and a half hours -- which feels even longer. The evening's most entertaining moments are the drag routines by the Triangle Club, a fraternity to which Fitzgerald belonged when he was at Princeton (2:30). Prospect Theater Company, at the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes) Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes) To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)    * 'FUNNY HA HA' (not rated, 89 minutes) Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creepshow, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'JIMINY GLICK IN LALAWOOD' (R, 90 minutes) This frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character is an intermittently funny free-for-all that suffers from attention deficit disorder. (Holden)    'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy and Robert Duvall (as Mr. Ferrell's father and rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson you'll win big anyway. (Scott)    'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in for the filmmaker to do the same. (Dargis)    'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two Dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MA MÈRE' (NC-17, 110 minutes, in French) Avid sensation seeking in this film is such a grim affair that after a short while, the spectacle of its aimless characters bending themselves out of shape in the pursuit of depravity mutates from titillating to pathetic to laughable. (Holden)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth-graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MINDHUNTERS' (R, 106 minutes) This thriller re-imagines Agatha Christie's ''Ten Little Indians'' as ''Eight Little Profilers'': a team of would-be F.B.I. agents, isolated at a training compound to solve a simulated crime, soon realize that a real serial killer walks among them. The film may find a cult audience among fans of schlock cinema seeking a giggle and a scream. (Dana Stevens)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad-boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a little league coach. Superb performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    * 'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    * '3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean) A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)    * 'À TOUTE DE SUITE' (Not rated, 96 minutes; in French) This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (né O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis)    Film Series    'CELEBRATING THE BLACK VOICES WEEKEND' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Symphony Space is screening George C. Wolfe's ''Lackawanna Blues'' (2005), based on Ruben Santiago-Hudson's play about a boardinghouse matriarch (S. Epatha Merkerson), and Stanley Nelson's ''Soldiers Without Swords'' (1999), a history of black newspapers in America. Mr. Santiago-Hudson, Ms. Merkerson and Mr. Nelson will hold question-and-answer sessions after their films. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400; $25. (Anita Gates)    'FIRST NATIONS/FIRST FEATURES' (Through Monday) The final days of the Museum of Modern Art's 25-film showcase of the first films of directors from indigenous cultures around the world. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400, $10, $8 for 65+, $6 for students. (Gates)    'ONCE UPON A TIME: SERGIO LEONE' (Through Sunday) A cold-blooded henchman and a nameless drifter? It must be Leone (1929-89), auteur of the so-called spaghetti western. BAM Cinématek continues its 10-day Leone tribute. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100; $10, $7 students and 65+, $6, Cinema Club Members. (Gates)    FRANÇOIS OZON RETROSPECTIVE (Sunday through June 5) The Museum of the Moving Image is honoring Mr. Ozon, the genre-bending French director of ''Swimming Pool'' and ''Under the Sand.'' The event begins with screenings of ''Sitcom'' (1998), about a suburban family with a rat, and ''Criminal Lovers'' (1999), a sort of tabloid version of the Hansel and Gretel story, and closes with a personal appearance by Mr. Ozon. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; museum admission, $10, $7.50, 65+ and students. (Gates)    PACIFIKA: NEW YORK HAWAIIAN FILM FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) Hey, how many film festivals include hula and ukulele workshops? New York University's Tisch School and the Hawaii Cultural Foundation are presenting some 30 features, documentaries and shorts that reflect the cultural heritage of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. Titles include ''Mauna Kea: Temple Under Siege'' and ''Polynesian Power: Islanders in Pro Football.'' Cantor Film Center, 36 East Eighth Street; Tisch Film and Television Theaters, 721 Broadway, (212)966-3378; $8 to $10. (Gates)    'SCREEN DECO' (Monday) Film Forum celebrates Art Deco Week with screenings of two highly designed 1930's films and 45-minute illustrated talks by Eric Myers and Howard Mandelbaum, authors of ''Screen Deco.'' Ralph Murphy's ''Top of the Town'' (1937) is about a luxury nightclub atop a skyscraper. Edmund Goulding's ''Reaching for the Moon'' (1930) is set on a grand ocean liner. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8110; $10, $5, children, members and 65+. (Gates)    JOHN SAYLES AND MAGGIE RENZI TRIBUTE (Tomorrow) Mr. Sayles and Ms. Renzi will appear in person at the Museum of the Moving Image to present screenings of two of their films and participate in panel discussions about political filmmaking and the role of women in the industry. The films are ''Matewan'' (1987), about a coal miners' strike, and ''City of Hope'' (1991), about politics, crime and corruption in New Jersey. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; museum admission, $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * THE BLOOD BROTHERS (Tuesday) Screaming lyrics like ''We're scrapped valentines/We're tangerine rinds'' over pummeling, chaotic guitars, this visceral Seattle quintet finds that temperature at which panicky noise-punk explodes into emo shrapnel. 8 p.m., Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, www.spiritnewyork.com or www.ticketmaster.com, $12. (Laura Sinagra)    BOREDOMS (Wednesday) For almost two decades now, the Japanese noise group has been one of the best psychedelic rock bands in the world. Though its latest album doesn't touch its best, its live show always matches sonic exploration with stage charisma. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)    * BRIGHT EYES, THE FAINT, MARS BLACK (Tomorrow through Wednesday) The Nebraskan singer-songwriter Conor Oberst is perhaps too jittery to resonate as a New Dylan to diehard fans of the Old Dylan. But his emphatic wisdom, political indignance and wine-soaked laments make him a contender for the best songwriter of his generation. These shows focus on music from the electronic rock half of his recent double-album. With goth-dance band The Faint and self-deprecating rapper Mars Black. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, (212)353-1600, $25, sold out. (Sinagra)    KELLY CLARKSON (Tomorrow) Pulling a hit song from the jaws of assured post- ''American Idol'' obscurity, the amiable Kelly Clarkson wisely ditched light dance pop for attitudinous pop rock. The Max Martin-penned ''Since You Been Gone'' is the catchiest party song since ''Hey Ya.'' 1 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)307-7171, $37. (Sinagra)    COMMON (Monday and Tuesday) The Chicago rapper Common has at times deserved the stigma that attends the label ''conscious rap'' -- the assumption of preachiness and lackluster execution. On his new record, though, he meets the challenge of working with the fellow Midwesterner and current ''It'' producer Kanye West. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, (212)243-4940, $30.(Sinagra)    * THE DECEMBERISTS (Thursday) The weight of the bandleader Colin Melloy's baroque songs about child queens, heartsick cold war spies and vengeful seafarers is lightened by his sweeping lovelorn sing-alongs. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505, $18. (Sinagra)    * DEERHOOF (Tomorrow and Sunday) This excitingly whimsical band harbors equal amounts affection for No Wave angularity, exuberant noise-pop, and outsider naif art like the Shaggs. Their latest release is an electronically augmented fractured fairy tale about a kidnapping milkman. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10 (Sinagra)    DR. JOHN: 'ALL BY HISSELF' (Tonight and tomorrow, and May 25-29) Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and florid piano playing to jazz standards and songs with a conscience. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., except Wednesday and Thursday when shows are at 8 p.m., Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455, $50. (Jon Pareles)    THE EVENS (Tomorrow) The Evens is the new duo from Ian MacKaye, who will forever be followed (if not always loved) by fans of his pioneering previous bands Minor Threat and Fugazi; joined by Amy Farina, he lends his famous wail to casual (but not passionless) indie-rock songs. With Parts & Labor and others. 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, the Lower East Side, www.eastrivermusicproject.com, free. (Kelefa Sanneh)    FISCHERSPOONER (Thursday) The heavily conceptual art-world buzz and gallery extravaganzas of Fischerspooner didn't turn its electro ditties into hits; now the band is back on a more humble scale. After show party with the D.J. Andrew Andrew ($10). 9 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, Chinatown, (212)941-8100, $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles)    JOSEPHINE FOSTER (Tonight) You might call Ms. Foster's eerie warbling old-fashioned, except that it evokes a scrambled past that exists only in her own vision: mountain songs that never were, spaced-out hybrids that never will be. She is to open for Akron/Family and the Angels of Light. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $15. (Sanneh)    FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE, BEN KWELLER (Sunday) Still underappreciated even after 2002's fluke MTV smash ''Stacy's Mom,'' these 30-something songwriters continue to write clever, pure pop ditties and some of the smartest yuppie satire around. This show benefits the Sing for the Children Fund. The Brooklyn-based melodist Ben Kweller opens. 4 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, $50 for concert-only, $150-$2500 for special VIP access. Information at www.singforthechildren.org. (Sinagra)    * GANG GANG DANCE (Thursday) This sly, angular local band recently released ''God's Money'' (The Social Registry), a beguiling album full of splintered post-punk rhythms that cohere around the dreamlike murmurs of Lizzi Bougatsos. With Bloodlines and Electroputas. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Sanneh)    GIPSY KINGS (Monday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, this French pop group is to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street, (212) 247-4777, $39.50 to $79.50. (Pareles)    * GZA, C-RAYZ WALZ, J-LIVE, VAST AIRE (Monday) The most cerebral Wu Tang Clan member, GZA (aka ''Genius''), fronts a tour of rappers who idealize the East Coast's Golden Age of elite M.C.'s. That is, they pursue nuance over histrionics and hubris. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $18.50 in advance, $20. (Sinagra)    SOPHIE B. HAWKINS (Tuesday) Most famous for the gay-positive radio hit, ''Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover'' on a 1992 album adorned with naked photos by David LaChappelle, the intriguingly gutsy Hawkins now plays the singer-songwriter circuit. 7 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-7235, $32 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sinagra)    HOT HOT HEAT (Tonight) In a fray of 80's revival bands with interchangeable frontmen, this Canadian outfit boasts the more memorable bounce of curlicued leader Steve Bays. Problem is, as evidenced by the petulant single ''Goodnight Goodnight,'' his relatively shallow vision and cloying choruses don't often justify the cocky posture and overwrought hiccups. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, (212)353-1600, $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)    BILLY IDOL (Sunday and Monday) Those who played the faux-noir ''White Wedding'' at their weddings, or affected a sexy snarl for old times' sake during pop-punker Billy Idol's quick flicker on MTV's ''I Love the 80's'' can now dance with themselves and others as Idol reprises his radio hits. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Upper West Side, (212)496-7070, $33.50 to $53.50. (Sinagra)    JIM & JENNIE AND THE PINETOPS (Monday) Unlike a lot of younger Alt-Country bands that nod to classic traditions, this Pennsylvania group actually plays accomplished bluegrass topped by high lonesome close-harmonic vocals. 7 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)    KING GYPSY ROCKER MASSIVE (Sunday) Gogol Bordello's Eugene Hutz has done for Gypsy music what the Pogues did for Irish traditionals, fusing their dizzy catharsis with visceral punk scuzz. This event fills the entire Knitting Factory complex with musicians occupying points on the Balkan punk rock continuum. Performers include DJ Hutz, World Inferno Friendship Society Nervous Cabaret, and Slavic Soul Party. 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132, $15. (Sinagra)    CYNDI LAUPER, NATALIE MERCHANT, NELLIE MCKAY, SANDRA BERNHARD (Monday) This benefit concert for the family of the well-regarded and recently deceased music executive Theresa Brilli will feature a full set by the 80's new wave rocker Ms. Lauper, as well as guest appearances by the serious-minded singer-songwriter Ms. Merchant, the cabaret wunderkind Nellie McKay and others. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212)777-6800, $60. (Sinagra)    * LIGHTNING BOLT (Thursday) This noisy and exuberant two-piece makes a terrifying racket, using fuzzed-into-obliteration bass and galloping drums (with some screaming, too) to create half-abstract pieces that hint at everything from heavy metal to dance music. With Mutant Life Expectancy and others. 9 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Columbia Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007, $10. (Sanneh)    SARAH MCLACHLAN (Tuesday) Still singing with epic pop swoon about love, resolute ambivalence, and broadly conceived existential matters, the founder of Lilith Fair is thinking increasingly globally (e.g., last year's ''World on Fire'' single). 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741, $34.50 to $84.50. (Sinagra)    MONADE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Laetitia Sadier of the pacific, intellectual art pop group Stereolab continues in that vein with music that's charming yet somewhat insular. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700, $14 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    MARK O'CONNOR, DAVID BROMBERG, NATALIE MACMASTER (Tomorrow) Billed as a ''fiddling summit,'' this concert should put some idiosyncratic twists into tradition. It includes Mark O'Connor's mixture of Appalachian and classical music, Natalie MacMaster's rough-hewn Celtic fiddling and stepdancing from Cape Breton and David Bromberg's all-American eclecticism and vintage violins, along with Mr. Bromberg's guests Jay Ungar (whose ''Ashokan Farewell'' was the theme of Ken Burns's ''Civil War'') and Molly Mason. 8 p.m. New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark (888)466-5722, $10 to $48. (Pareles)    JOHN OSWALD AND MICHAEL SNOW (Monday) Early adopter of mashup pop bricolage, the ''Plunderphonics'' originator John Oswald plays saxophone with the avant-garde filmmaker/artist, and here pianist, Michael Snow. 9:30 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, (212)358-7501, $10. (Sinagra)    PINBACK (Tuesday) Overthought pop constructions are an acquired taste, but this band's pointillist songs are at their most compelling when they sound like stripped-down sonic schematics. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212)777-6800, $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    PLASTIC PEOPLE OF THE UNIVERSE (Sunday) In Prague in the 1960's, the Plastic People of the Universe transmuted the lessons of Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground into dank, dissonant, precise songs that drew the wrath of Czechoslovakia's Communist government. The band's persecution galvanized a dissident movement that eventually triumphed. But the reconstituted band's songs are more than period pieces; by finding a rock language for Eastern European angst, they turn desperation inside out. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)539-8777, $25 in advance, $30. (Pareles)    RILO KILEY, PORTASTATIC (Thursday) This band combines the expansive American longing of Bruce Springsteen with the bedroom introspection of early Liz Phair. The frontwoman Jennie Lewis's humanized star power makes for an explosive live show. The Superchunk leader Mac MacCaughan's long-standing side project Portastatic opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, (212)353-1600, $18 in advance, $20. (Sinagra)    SNOW PATROL (Tonight) This lush, introspective British pop music about the mundane acrimonies of close romantic relationships appeals to fans of Coldplay and The Shins. 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, (212)777-6800, $23, sold out. (Sinagra)    TAJ MAHAL (Tuesday through Thursday) The fingerpicking, jazz-loving, globe-hopping yet down-home bluesman measures the persistence of the blues as he traces its kin. 8 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592, $30. (Pareles)    TEAM SLEEP (Wednesday) Though his band, the Deftones, got famous on the frat-friendly nu-metal circuit in the late 90's, Chino Moreno has a reputation as a thoughtful lyricist and eclectic music fan.

(Sinagra)    U2 (Tonight) After 2000's thrilling ''All that You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), the new ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope) and the ''Vertigo'' tour itself focus on what humans can live without: namely ICBM's and, evidently, some of U2's more shopworn live staples. Hence the vivid resurrection of decades-old rarities like ''Electric Co.'' 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741, $54 to $169, sold out.

(Ratliff)    * BILL FRISELL TRIO (Tomorrow and Sunday) This group, with the keyboardist Sam Yahel and the drummer Brian Blade, is one of three different trios that the guitarist Bill Frisell now plays with, and it's the one that perhaps goes the furthest out there. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232, cover, $30.

Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)258-9800, $30, plus a $10 minimum (Ratliff)    ANDREW HILL 'RETRO' QUARTET (Through tomorrow) The pianist Andrew Hill is one of the most mysterious composers of modern jazz, not just for his fraught harmonies and layered rhythms but for his periodic disappearances from the scene. But he's come back over the last decade, leading a number of bands; this is a quartet with the saxophonist Greg Tardy, the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Leroi Jones. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212)581-3080, cover, $30, plus a $10 minimum.

(Ratliff)    * BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Hutcherson is one of the great individual voices and better composers in jazz, and he's a vibraphonist, making him triply rare.

(Ratliff)    VISION CLUB: LIFETIME VISIONS ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow night) A band led by the saxophonist Joseph Jarman, one of the founders of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, and the pianist and composer Chris Chalfant.

But he is also an earthy blues-and-bop player from Chicago; his résumé includes time in the bands of Dinah Washington, Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley. 8, 10, and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626, cover, $20, minimum, $10. (Ratliff)    KATE McGARRY (Tomorrow) A lot of jazz singers are good at a few devices and punch them out song after song; Ms. McGarry has a deeper supply. You'll find shades of pop singers like Suzanne Vega and Rickie Lee Jones in her voice; you'll also find some of the highest refinements of great jazz singing. She has a breadth of material that runs from jazz standards to traditional Irish ballads to a version of the Kinks' ''(So) Tired of Waiting for You.''

(Ratliff)    * EIVIND OPSVIK 'OVERSEAS' (Wednesday) Mr. Opsvik is a young Norwegian bassist and bandleader with an unusual gift for writing small, poignant pieces of music. His melodic shards are strong, as are the chord sequences moving underneath them; he has the distinction, in a time when jazz compositions are becoming increasingly opaque, of writing catchy tunes, and his fat-toned, unfussy bass sound enhances them. His new record is ''Overseas II,'' on Fresh Sound, and his band includes Tony Malaby, Jacob Sacks, Craig Taborn, and Kenny Wollesen. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883, cover, $8 and a one-drink minimum (Ratliff)    OREGON (Through) Celtic music, jazz, swing and classical guitar get all mixed up in the music of Oregon, a band that's been around since 1970.

(Ratliff)    * NICHOLAS PAYTON QUINTET (Wednesday through May 28) The trumpeter Nicholas Payton first grabbed the jazz world's attention with his remarkable feeling for early New Orleans jazz and more recently made an obstinately spacey funk record, but he's spent most of his professional time dealing with the rich languages of post-1960 jazz. Here he'll be mining that territory. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212)581-3080, cover, $30, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff)    ERIC REED TRIO (Through tomorrow) Always alert and fluent, Mr. Reed, the pianist, has gospel and bebop and a lot of post-50's modernism in him, too.

(Ratliff)    * LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA PLAYS THAD JONES (Through tomorrow) The trumpeter and composer Thad Jones, who died in 1986, always deserves a second look. A member of Count Basie's orchestra during the 1950's and early 60's, he decamped to form his own big band, which played weekly shows at the Village Vanguard, starting a new large-ensemble jazz tradition. Jazz at Lincoln Center's gleaming band takes on his music, with the saxophonists Jerry Dodgion and Billy Harper and the bass trombonist Douglas Purviance, as guests; Vincent Gardner, one of Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra's trombonists, presents new arrangements of the old tunes. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)721-6500, $85to $150. (Ratliff)    * CLARK TERRY (Tuesday through May 29) It's possible that no other jazz musician has as much amusing old-guy charm as Mr. Terry, and when you think he's all sweetness, he'll rattle you profoundly with a cool, beautifully executed piece of fluegelhorn playing. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037, $30. (Ratliff)    THE TRIO/SEX MOB (Tonight) The Trio includes three jazz-oriented jam-band heroes: the bassist Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin & Wood), the saxophonist Skerik (who plays with Stanton Moore and Galactic) and the drummer Johnny Vidacovich (of Astral Project). Sex Mob is rowdy quartet led by the slide-trumpeter Steven Bernstein, known to cover songs written by everyone from Wynton Marsalis to Nirvana; Mr. Bernstein is a gifted enough arranger to get the sarcasm-to-respect equation right, 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, $20. (Ratliff)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Tonight) Musically not much of an opera, it does provide a meaty role for the ageless tenor Plácido Domingo, who gives a vocally fervent and poignant portrayal of Cyrano, the fearless and noble guardsman cursed with an absurdly huge nose. The cast is excellent, and Francesca Zambello has created a stylish and handsome production. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available. (Anthony Tommasini)    'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Run on enthusiasm and a shoestring, the tiny Amato Opera mounts a modest production of the Donizetti classic.

And the Met has assembled a top-rank cast, especially René Pape as Mephistopheles. Alas, the Met's new production by Andrei Serban is a jumble. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available. (Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) The Met puts its season to bed with a soothing old favorite: Puccini's classic, in Franco Zeffirelli's lavish and historically authentic production. The high point of the cast should be Marcello Giordani, who has been singing ardently and ringingly, as Cavaradossi. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $145 and $215 tickets remain. (Anne Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the best for chamber music.

Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)997-7717, $100 and $250. (Tommasini)    NEW YORK CHORAL SOCIETY (Tonight) It's like Giacomo in the Kentucky Derby: an amateur chorus overmatched in Beethoven's well-nigh unsingable ''Missa Solemnis.'' A risky proposition, it nevertheless affords the opportunity to shine. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $18 to $75. (Oestreich)    NEW YORK NEW MUSIC ENSEMBLE (Monday) Contemporary music often involves a measure of gamesmanship, or at least, a sometimes fluid negotiation between the composer and the performers (and sometimes the listeners). With game-playing as its theme, this first-rate group offers works by Hiroya Miura, Wayne Peterson, John Anthony Lennon, David Rakowski and Andrew Imbrie. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3303, $15; $10 for students and 65+.

Noteworthy items include Boris Eifman's spectacularly dire ''Musagete'' tonight (see Eifman Ballet, above); Robbins's ''Goldberg Variations'' tomorrow and Tuesday nights; and a particularly appealing bill Wednesday of Balanchine's ''Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet'' and his classic ''Four Temperaments'' along with Robbins's ''Glass Pieces.''

(Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION: AFRICAN AMERICAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    * ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700. Also at Queens: ''Fatal Love.'' (Holland Cotter)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. (See above.) (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, the innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with Revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Michael Kimmelman)    * SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Núñez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquín Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)    MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST,' through May 29. Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!: SELF-TAUGHT ARTISTS, THE BIBLE AND THE AMERICAN SOUTH,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelists. Many names familiar to followers of 20th century folk and outsider art are on hand including William Edmondson, Minnie Evans, the Reverend Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Kimmelman)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. (See above.) (Smith)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art, or music, this country has produced. Also at the museum: ''Chris Ofili: Afro Muses 1995-2005.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Smith)    THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    * JACK GOLDSTEIN A hero of the Pictures generation revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. His films from the early 70's (from 20 seconds to five minutes long) have a cool, deadpan quality recalling early videos of William Wegman. Ed Ruscha-style paintings of lightning storms from the 80's, here and at Metro, are thrillingly cinematic. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, through May 27. (Johnson)    * 'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery,125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, through June 4. (Cotter)    * RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    'EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY' Among more than 70 narrative paintings, drawings and prints by a wide range of 20th century artists are works by Max Beckmann, James Ensor, John Heartfield, Kathe Kollwitz, Sue Coe, Martha Rosler and Eric Fischl. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212)245-6734, through May 27. (Johnson)    'WILDER' This tribute to theLos Angeles dealer Nicholas Wilder, (1937-1989) presents works by 28 artists who were shown at his gallery between 1965 and 1979. The all-star lineup includes Dan Flavin, Agnes Martin, John McCracken, Richard Tuttle and Cy Twombly. Parrasch and Washburn galleries, 20 West 57th Street, (212)246-5360 and(212)246-5300, through May 27. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    TINA BARNEY The photographer known for her large, sumptuous color photographs of rich people often caught in situations of subtle psychological tension presents portraits shot in Spain and Germany that are included in her book ''The Europeans.'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, (212)431-0166, through May 27. (Johnson)    TERAO KATSUHIRO, SHINKI TOMOYUKI, YOSHIMUNE KAZUHIRO, YUMOTO MITSUO Four artists, from a Japanese facility for the artistically talented mentally disabled, appear possessed of naïve but intense imaginations and formal predilections bordering on compulsive. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212)925-1200, through May 31. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' A video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212)462-2668, through May 28. (Smith)    DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the hand-made and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)    IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child-star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212)206-3583, through June 4. (Smith)    CHERYL DONEGAN: 'OLD, TEMPORARY' While video-projected images of colorful cheap toys unfold on the wall, a woman's maniacally cheerful voice recites a rapid-fire litany of affirmations composed for Amway salespeople: ''I am the best at what I do. There is no one better. I get the job done,'' and so on. It is funny and scary. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through June 4. (Johnson)    ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)    AMY GARTRELL: 'HOT HANDS, COLD HEART' The tribulations and infatuations of youth are the subjects of drawings, felt banners and an installation involving faceted glass charms and a lugubrious tree that would have done Edward Gorey proud. Daniel Reich, 537A West 23rd Street,(212)924-4949, through May 28. (Smith)    JAMES GOBEL: 'RIDICULE IS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF' Fat Rococo-era fops pose on a striped floor against a background of snow-covered rocky peaks in a campy, mural-scale confection made of neatly assembled pieces of colored felt. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212)352-2238, through May 27. (Johnson)    'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, through May 27. (Smith)    NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree braches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)    RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by the influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through June 18. (Johnson)    'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)    QIU SHIHUA: 'INSIGHT' At first, the canvases by this painter from Shenzhen, China, look like nothing more than slightly scuffed expanses of raw fabric. Look again and you discover peaceful, luminously misty landscapes realized with amazing subtlety. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212)414-1169, through May 28. (Johnson) JOHN F. SIMON JR.: 'ENDLESS VICTORY' Mesmerizing, animated patterns driven by sophisticated software programs and running on laptop screens; they would make excellent screen savers. One plays inventive variations on Mondrian's ''Victory Boogie Woogie.'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646)336-7183, through May 28. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes tear drops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    * AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock-coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)    Last Chance    JOSEF ALBERS/DONALD JUDD: 'STRUCTURE AND COLOR' Despite the 40-year age difference, this vivacious museum-quality show of two geometric abstractionists -- one proto-Minimalist, the other Minimalist -- is a call and response echo chamber of levitating squares and rectangles of color. Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212)925-4338, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    'COLLAGE: SIGNS AND SURFACES' Joseph Cornell, Romare Beardon, Jess, Robert Rauschenberg and other big names in collage history are on hand for this show of works by more than 70 artists. But many of the most intriguing works are by lesser knowns, like Arch Connelly's pearl-encrusted ''Self Portrait'' and Michael Cooper's ''16 Yellow Things,'' a gridded arrangement of a ticket stub, a Lego block and 14 other small items. Zoubok, 533 West 23rd Street, (212)675-7490, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    WILL DUTY Mr. Duty uses a computer and scanned photographs to generate subtle, flickering compositions of stars, bars and flames, but he translates the imagery by hand and pencil onto paper, to dense, richly sensuous effect. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212)989-0156, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * KELLY KACZYNSKI A graduate of Bard College makes a debut with an apotheosis of art-about-art and optical illusion in which seemingly formless sculptures, viewed through a peephole, coalesce into an image of one of Marcel Duchamp's best-known works. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212)865-0783, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    LINDA MATALON: 'MIDDLE FALLS' A suite of 36 drawings that catalog, but mainly commemorate, as many recent sculptures turn a room into an evocative installation full of glimpses of fragmentary forms in mysterious spaces. Wynn Kramarsky, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, SoHo, (212)966-6601, closing tomorrow.

Previews and Openings    'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' Opens tomorrow.

Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, (212) 279-4200.    'LOVE/LIFE A LIFE IN SONG' Opens Sunday.

'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens late May/early June.

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' Previews start Monday. Opens May 26. A musical based on the infamous 1920s murder inspired by the philosophy of Nietzsche. Sounds like a joke, but doesn't seem to be (1:30). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, (212) 868-444.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish wind-up music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us. (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real-estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialouge with such pure love for the athletics of acting? (1:45). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a supsected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it too suffers from fundmental mistmatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winner (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, childs-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt,'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked.'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at East 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)    'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Closing tomorrow at the Houseman. Reopening June 9 at the Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street. (Neil Genzlinger)    'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the two maids (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger)    'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women (1:25). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR' Henry Adam's play starts out as a humorous, trenchant fable on how fear of terrorism can distort individual lives, not to say nations, but something mysterious happens after intermission: it mutates into a sitcom. The actors Ronny Jhutti and Mark McDonnell are very much worth watching, though. Part of Brits Off Broadway (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)    'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100 . (Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'LES BELLES SOEURS' There is a good John Waters movie hiding inside Michael Tremblay's all-woman play. This likable comedy about a New England woman who wins a million trading stamps wants to be a farce but is just a collection of observations searching for a shape (1:30). Center Stage NY, 48 West 21st Street, (212)330-8650, closing at Center Stage on Sunday. The production moves to the Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village for performances on May 21 and 22. (Anita Gates)    'CHANTECLER' A version of Edmond Rostand's fable about a rooster and his role in the cosmos, looks like a family show and bills itself as a family show, but it's pitched way over the heads of the age group that would most enjoy its colorful costumes. But Cory Einbinder, the director, manages to make a smattering of scenes memorable: a parade of mutant roosters; a ridiculous trio of toads (2:20). Teatro La Tea, at Clemente Soto Valez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, second floor, (212)353-3101. (Genzlinger)    'THE PURSUIT OF PERSEPHONE' A musical inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's college romance with Ginevra King, jams 26 songs into two and a half hours -- which feels even longer. The evening's most entertaining moments are the drag routines by the Triangle Club, a fraternity to which Fitzgerald belonged when he was at Princeton (2:30). Prospect Theater Company, at the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, (212)352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100.

(Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING' Cheers to the British cabaret trio that calls itself Fascinating Aida. These women revel in the here and now. They are bawdy and political; loopy (in that crisp English way) and whimsical (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. ( Margo Jefferson)    'PERSEUS' Performed in ancient Greek, ''Perseus'' tells the story of the son of Zeus who slew the serpent-headed Medusa and saved Andromeda from a sea monster. The production has the flamboyant pageantry and occasional ridiculousness of a low rent runway show (1:40). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, (212)475-7710, closing on Sunday. (Jason Zinoman)    'PRIVILEGE' Paul Weitz's delicate if uneven comedy examines the collateral damage sustained by the family of a disgraced titan of Wall Street. Humanizing a world normally glimpsed only it tabloid flashes, the play is also, and most memorably, a touching hymn to the sustaining bonds of fraternal affection. Conor Donovan and Harry Zittel are terrific as the sons of the fallen businessman (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, (212)246-4422, closing on Wednesday. (Isherwood)    'SISTERS, SUCH DEVOTED SISTERS' Mixing fact and fiction as the transvestite Bernice Hindley, the actor Russell Barr tells a dark and caustic tale of life on the underside in Edinburgh. He was funniest, though, when riffing on a collection of eccentrics from Bernice's -- and presumably his own -- family. Part of Brits Off Broadway (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Stevens)    'THE THREE MUSKETEERS' A lot of story and actors have been crammed into this musical version. Unfortunately, that seems to have left little room for other crucial ingredients, like panache (2:30). Wings, 154 Christopher Street, (212)627-2961, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this production. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes). A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes). Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali). A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    * 'THE BEST OF YOUTH' (not rated, 6 hours and 23 minutes, shown in two parts; in Italian). Marco Tullio Giordana's six-hour journey through recent Italian history is nothing less than a masterpiece, combining epic sweep with precise, heart-rending intimacy. (Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish). This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes). A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of an extremely hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DOUBLE DARE' (not rated, 81 minutes). This new documentary about (stunt) women who like to roll cars, throw punches and jump from gaspingly tall heights is another reminder of how tough it is for the second sex to make it in Hollywood. (Dargis)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes). This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)    * 'FUNNY HA HA' (not rated, 89 minutes). Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)    'THE GIRL FROM MONDAY' (not rated, 84 minutes). Like so many science fiction fantasies, this deadpan comedy, which is ''Brave New World'' Lite, begins with a witty premise, then stumbles all over itself trying to tell a coherent, original story. (Holden)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes). In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish). The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes). Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes). Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creepshow, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes). A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'JIMINY GLICK IN LALAWOOD' (R, 90 minutes). This frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character is an intermittently funny free-for-all that suffers from attention deficit disorder. (Holden)    'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes). A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in for the filmmaker to do the same. (Dargis)    'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes). The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese). This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes). Two Dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French). A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MELINDA AND MELINDA' (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though Woody Allen's drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, the director interweaves them deftly enough. (Scott)    * 'MILLIONS' (PG, 97 minutes). Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Danny Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. (Dargis)    'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. (Dargis)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (not rated, 99 minutes). Gregg Araki, one-time bad-boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a little league coach. Superb performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean). The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes). The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes). This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes). Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    * '3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean). A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)    * 'À TOUTE DE SUITE' (not rated, 96 minutes; in French). This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)    'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen to do some marvelous work. (Scott)    'WALK ON WATER' (not rated, 104 minutes). The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Dana Stevens)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (not rated, 45 minutes). A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)    'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (né O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis)    Film Series    'FIRST NATIONS/FIRST FEATURES' (Through May 23) The Museum of Modern Art's 25-film showcase of the first films of directors from indigenous cultures around the world.

BAM Cinématek begins its 10-day Leone tribute with Henry Fonda in ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' (1968) today and tomorrow, then Clint Eastwood in ''A Fistful of Dollars'' (1964) on Sunday.

Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge play the title roles, with Sammy Davis Jr. as Sportin' Life. ''Summertime'' and ''I Got Plenty uh Nuttin' '' are just a couple of the exquisite Gershwin songs. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; free with admission; museum admission: $10, $7.50 for 65+ and students, $5 for children, ages 5 to 18; free for members and children under 5.

Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600; $10, $7 for students, $6 for members, $5 for children and 65+. (Stevens)    'WELCOME DANGER' (Through May 17) Film Forum's four-week Harold Lloyd festival winds up with his 1929 comedy about a mild-mannered botanist helping track down a Chinatown drug lord. This was a huge hit as a talkie-silent hybrid, but Lloyd kept the original silent.

TREY ANASTASIO (Tonight and Tomorrow) This leader of the now defunct jam band Phish has spent recent down time joining protégés onstage and recording a stripped-down guitar album, ditching the studio filigree of his previous solo outing. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)485-1534, $38. (Laura Sinagra)    THE BRAVERY (Monday and Tuesday) Currently braving a bit of a backlash, this muscular band was New York's Next Big Post-Strokes thing until rumored ego issues provoked skepticism among downtown fans. Monday at 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $16.50. Tuesday at 9 p.m.,Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505, $17.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    BRITISH SEA POWER, FEIST (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Brighton band puts a dreamy spin on vaguely gothic new wave with its insistent baritone vocals and bright guitar lines. Onstage it favors military garb and vertiginous hats, suggesting the ominous human forest in ''Macbeth.'' 8:30 p.m. tomorrow, 8 p.m. Sunday, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, (212)533-2111, $15 in advance, $17 at the door.

Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212)496-7070, tickets available through special arrangement on coldplay.com. (Sinagra)    * CRAZY TITCH, J2K, DJ CAMEO (Saturday) Another invasion from London's booming grime scene, this one led by the rowdy rhyme-spitter Crazy Titch; here's hoping the crowd is as manic as the performers. 11:30 p.m., Crash Mansion, 199 Bowery, at Spring Street, Lower East Side, (212)982-7767. $5 before 1 a.m. Sunday morning, $8 after. (Kelefa Sanneh)    THE CRYSTAL METHOD (Tomorrow) This duo specializes in loud, straightforward D.J. sets that aim to conjure up the raucous energy of hard rock. 10 p.m., Spirit, 530 W. 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)268-9477, $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sanneh)    LILY CUSHMAN CULHANE (Sunday) This singer-songwriter's tracks recall the trip-pop favored by wistful optimists like Dido and Jem. Her honeyed jazzy vocal technique sets her apart. 9:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, (212)420-1466, $7. (Sinagra)    DONNA THE BUFFALO AND HACKENSAW BOYS (Tonight) Donna the Buffalo's good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country, also dipping into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $18. (Jon Pareles)    DOVES, MERCURY REV (Wednesday and Thursday) The Doves bring a rough ''Madchester'' dance pedigree to their sweeping guitar pop, making the trio's music slightly edgier than other big- room British acts like Coldplay. Enduring space-rockers Mercury Rev open. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $30.(Sinagra)    DR JOHN: 'ALL BY HISSELF' (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and May 20-21 and May 25-29) Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and florid piano playing to jazz standards and songs with a conscience. 8 p.m., except May 20-21 and May 27-29 when shows are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455, $50. (Pareles)    DOC WATSON (Wednesday) Doc Watson is the embodiment of a mountain-music heritage. He's an understated master of a rural repertory that spans blues, bluegrass, country and ragtime, and he's a flatpicking guitar whiz whose leads rush by like a pine-scented breeze. 7 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Pareles)    EL VEZ (Tomorrow) Most Elvis imitators are corny; El Vez is conceptual, merging Presleyana, Mexican-American in-jokes and bad puns to simultaneously honor and twist the Presley legacy. 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Pareles)    GANG OF FOUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) In a season of reunions, the legendary British post-punk sloganeers Gang of Four bring their angular dance-rock back onto a circuit rife with young imitators. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $25. (Sinagra)    * THE GOOD LIFE (Tonight) This band is the quieter project from singer-songwriter Tim Kasher (who also leads the knotty emo act Cursive); expect to hear hushed, densely written songs from the strong recent Good Life CD, ''Album of the Year'' (Saddle Creek), on which the pairings are even sadder than the splittings. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $14.(Sanneh)    PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK PRESENTS 'THE WALL' (Tonight and Tomorrow) Philadelphia's Paul Green and his real-life ''School of Rock'' are featured in the recent documentary ''Rock School'' (NewMarket). There the little shredders play Frank Zappa. Here they assay Pink Floyd's opus. 7 p.m., TriBeCa Rock Club, 16 Warren Street, (212)766-1070, $10. (Sinagra)    DAVID GRISMAN (Wednesday) Before phrases like ''new acoustic music'' or ''bluegrass revival'' were being bandied around, David Grisman was picking his mandolin in what he named ''dawg music,'' a perfectly noncommital moniker for string-band music that cheerfully picked its way through country, bluegrass, jazz, klezmer, Brazilian choros and whatever else Mr. Grisman finds engaging. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212)840-2824, $30 to $50. (Pareles)    GYPSY MUSIC OF ROMANIA: TARAF DE HAIDOUKS (Tomorrow) Hailing from the village of Clejani, Romania, this Roma music outfit showcases deft fiddle, accordion and cimbalom arrangements of whirlwind dance music and traditional ballads. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824, $25 to $40, college students with ID, $15.(Sinagra)    * NEIL HAMBURGER (Tonight) This meta-comedian, who bills himself as ''America's funnyman,'' excels when the audience hates him (or pretends to); tonight, he may well find himself face to face with a roomful of fans, armed only with repulsive punchlines, awkward silences, and an ill-fitting suit. Expect a magical night. 8 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733, $8. (Sanneh)    HEARTLESS BASTARDS (Wednesday) The southern Ohio singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom's primal yowl gets her compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. Her power trio's hungry stomp is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10.(Sinagra)    THE HOLD STEADY (Thursday) With smart swagger, the Hold Steady savant Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. $13 in advance $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    KASABIAN (Monday and Tuesday) Don't let their namesake, Charles Manson's getaway driver, fool you. The band's mix of classic rock and electronic music is perfectly harmless. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)    PETER MURPHY (Monday) This goth rock heartthrob and leader of 80's dark side pioneers Bauhaus has a cult audience that of late has followed him on forays into Middle Eastern sonics. His most recent record is a poppier bid. 11:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $35. (Sinagra)    THE PHARCYDE (Tonight) With the departure of the memorable potheads Slimkid and Fatlip, these California backpack rappers' goofy mid-90's charm waned well before the turn of the century. But the two founders, Imani and Bootie Brown, still release albums and will perfrom with a band late and off the beaten track. 11 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718)797-3007, $14. (Sinagra)    WILLY PORTER (Monday) An impressive purveyor of rapid-fingered acoustic guitar technique, Mr. Porter has developed a gentle vocal style that smartly softens what might otherwise seem overly crafty. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, $20. (Sinagra).    PURPLE CITY AND FRIENDS, THEODORE UNIT (Tomorrow) An offshoot of Cam'ron's Harlem's hip-op crew the Diplomats', Purple City performs material from its new record, along with the Ghostface Killah side project Theodore Unit and the Bed Stuy story-rapper Spec Booge. D.J. sets by the mix tape mavens DJ Mighty Mi and DJ Catchdubs. 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $12, $14 at the door. (Sinagra)    JOEY RAMONE BIRTHDAY BASH (Thursday) This annual event turns lingering grief over the 2001 death of the Ramones frontman into a kinetic celebration of the band's legacy. Guests include the younger punks like the Bouncing Souls as well as veterans like the Dictators' Andy Shernoff and Lunachick Theo. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, 212-777-6800, $25, sold out. (Sinagra)    SAMITE (Tomorrow) This Ugandan singer and storyteller surrounds his gentle voice with the twinkling intricacies of his kalimba (thumb piano), marimba or lintungu (lyre). 8 p.m. Satalla, 37 West 26th, (212)576-1155, Chelsea, $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles)    BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (Thursday) The Boss made ''The Rising'' after the towers fell, beating the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer to the notion of reverse-collapse by four years. Mr. Springsteen's spare ''Devils and Dust'' (Sony) charts the way back down, meditating with other soul-searchers at the crossroads of humanism and religion. 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900, $75 and $85, sold out. (Sinagra)    STING (Tonight) This adult-contemporary pop superstar's most recent material continues to explore aging, romance and rich-guy guilt over lush world-music-inflected instrumentation. Joss Stone, the young English blues belter and current star of a summer Gap ad, opens. 8 p.m., Tommy Hilfiger at Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $33 to $86. (Sinagra)    SUPAGROUP (Wednesday) Known for their raucous stage show, this AC/DC-loving Louisiana four-piece tears through its countrified punk and riff-raff metal repertory with the kind of abandon that more manicured garage bands lack. 10 p.m., Snitch, 59 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)727-7775, free. (Sinagra)    U2 (Tuesday and Wednesday) After 2000's thrilling ''All that You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope) and the ''Vertigo'' tour itself focus on what humans can live without: namely ICBM's and, evidently, some of U2's more shopworn live staples. Hence the vivid resurrection of decades-old rarities like ''Electric Co.'' 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900, $51.50 to $167, sold out. (Sinagra)    VELVET REVOLVER (Tomorrow) Comparing the druggy baritone of the former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weilland to the feral howl of vintage Axl Rose is unfair. But even without Axl, the former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash and crew are still aces at groovy, scruffy metal. 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Pkwy., Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $65. (Sinagra)    YO LA TENGO: THE SOUNDS OF SCIENCE (Wednesday) The Hoboken indie-rock icons known for rendering both the quiet spaces and explosive pathos of committed love perform an original score to the short films of the oceanographer Jean Painlevés. 8 p.m., Rose Theater at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)258-9800, $40.

(Holden)    * BARBARA COOK (Tuesdays through Saturdays) Now 77, the great lyric soprano pays tribute to her longtime musical director Wally Harper who died last October, and other friends who are gone.

Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30, with a $10 minimum at a table. (Holden)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    JOHN ABERCROMBIE GROUP (Through tomorrow) With the lineup that accompanies him this week -- Mark Feldman on violin, Joey Baron on drums, Marc Johnson on bass -- Mr. Abercrombie, a guitarist, has made the recent albums, ''Cat 'n' Mouse'' and ''Class Trip,'' two of his best. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212)581-3080, cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

(Ratliff)    PATRICIA BARBER (Through Sunday) A dry, smart, passionate and original singer-songwriter-pianist.

(Ratliff)    * ANDY BISKIN'S GOLDBERG VARIATIONS (Through Sunday) That's Goldberg as in Rube Goldberg. Andy Biskin, a jazz clarinetist with a low-key sense of humor, composed a series of pieces around Goldberg's elaborately wacky inventions, and also animated the original drawings. So what you get is a dozen jazz tone poems scored for sextet, with film accompaniment, about how to grow hair on balding men or how to light a cigar in a speeding car. It's an all-ages piece of work, and kids are especially welcome at the matinee performances. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., and tomorrow and Sunday at noon, Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery at Bleecker, East Village, (212)614-0505, $15, $10 for children under 12. (Ratliff)    * PETER BRÖTZMANN CHICAGO TENTET (Wednesday) In the last decade, Peter Brötzmann, the German saxophonist, has become a father figure for American free-jazz musicians. His Tentet has a revolving cast but usually includes some of the cream of the Chicago scene (like the saxophonist Ken Vandermark); this week it also has musicians from Germany, Norway and Sweden. Its music is far from completely free, making shrewd use of conducting and arrangements -- a good thing for Mr. Brötzmann, whose bellowing tone could rip a hole in the wall. 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501, $15. (Ratliff)    GERALD CLAYTON GROUP (Tomorrow) A young pianist, the son of the bassist John Clayton, here leads a band including some excellent musicians -- the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, the saxophonist Tim Warfield and the drummer Obed Calvaire. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063, $15.

(Ratliff)    * 'ESSENTIALLY ELLINGTON' CONCERT (Sunday) By the time you get to Avery Fisher Hall, 15 high school jazz bands have been through semifinals, playing Ellington before eminent judges to earn a spot among the top three that you'll hear in concert. The ''Essentially Ellington'' international high school jazz-band contest, produced and organized by Jazz at Lincoln Center -- this is the 10th annual -- is designed to be fun to watch, and it's also a reliable indicator of just how good the next crop of professional jazz musicians will be. 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, 65th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)721-6500, $20. (Ratliff)    CURTIS FULLER QUINTET (Through tomorrow) The trombonist formerly from Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers still soulfully showing how it's done. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212) 885-7000 , cover, $20. (Ratliff)    BENNY GOLSON QUARTET (Through tomorrow) The tenor saxophonist Mr. Golson, in his mid-70's, is an unlikely jazz hero: upbeat, fascinated with technique, a nonpurist who has spent equal time among the different aesthetic dispositions of East and West Coast jazz. 9, 11 and 12:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662, cover, $25. (Ratliff)    ANDREW HILL 'RETRO' QUARTET (Wednesday and Thursday) The pianist Andrew Hill is one of the most mysterious composers of modern jazz, not just for his fraught harmonies and layered rhythms but for his periodic disappearances from the scene. But he's come back over the last decade, leading a number of bands; this is a quartet with the saxophonist Greg Tardy, the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Leroi Jones. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212)581-3080, cover, $30. (Ratliff)    BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Hutcherson is one of the great individual voices and better composers in jazz, and he's a vibraphonist, making him triply rare. After 40 years, he still sounds current. The band includes pianist Mike LeDonne, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Billy Drummond. 9 and 11 p.m. Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-4037, cover, $30.

Rose Hall, 5th Floor, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)258-9800, cover, $30. (Ratliff)    BIRELI LAGRENE'S MUSIC OF DJANGO REINHARDT (Through Sunday) Mr. Lagrene, a Sinti Gypsy like Django Reinhardt and one of the most talented guitarists to have adopted his style, is a more sensitive, temperate musician than many of his fellow Djangophiles; this is his sextet. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 8, 10 and 11:30; Sunday at 8 and 10. Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212)582-2121, cover, $32.50, today and Sunday, $35 tomorrow, with a $10 minimum. (Ratliff)    * LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA PLAYS THAD JONES (Thursday) The trumpeter and composer Thad Jones, who died in 1986, always deserves a second look. A member of Count Basie's orchestra during the 1950's and early 60's, he decamped to form his own big band which played weekly shows at the Village Vanguard, starting a new large-ensemble jazz tradition. Jazz at Lincoln Center's gleaming band takes on his music, with the saxophonists Jerry Dodgion and Billy Harper and the bass trombonist Douglas Purviance, as guests; Vincent Gardner, one of Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra's trombonists, presents new arrangements of the old tunes. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P.

They're playing Thad Jones pieces all week (there are some on Mr. Lovano's new album ''Joyous Encounter''), stylistically rolling the last 50 years of jazz history around. 7:30 and 9:30, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)258-9800, cover, $30. (Ratliff)    BILL McHENRY TRIO (Tuesday) Like players decades ago, the tenor saxophonist Mr. McHenry puts his big, round sound before anything else; he likes playing slowly and choosing his moves, guided compositionally by Ornette Coleman and emotionally by Don Byas. 9:30 p.m., Nublu, 62 Avenue C, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, East Village, www.nublu.net, cover, $5. (Ratliff)    MISHA MENGELBERG (Through Sunday) The legendary Dutch jazz pianist, a practitioner of wise mischief, in a series of collaborations. Tonight with Frances-Marie Uitti and Ikue Mori; tomorrow with Mark Feldman; Sunday with John Zorn. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C at 2nd Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com, $15. (Ratliff)    * BEN MONDER QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) Ben Monder has played nearly unsurpassable modern jazz guitar with any number of actual jazz groups. But what he plays in his own group comes from another planet: it is exploratory, meditative, and a little eerie, with Theo Bleckman often singing wordlessly on top of the music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, (212)576-2232, cover, $20. (Ratliff)    ROY NATHANSON QUARTET (Sunday) The saxophonist Mr. Nathanson was always the principal composer of the long-running band the Jazz Passengers, and his pieces often included bits of jokes and stories; here, with a band including the violinist Sam Bardfeld, the bassist Tim Kaya and the drummer Gerald Cleaver, he's focusing on new pieces that more deeply combine spoken narratives with music. 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177, $8. (Ratliff)    STEVE NELSON QUARTET (Through tomorrow) One of New York's best jazz musicians for a long time now, and one of the best parts of Dave Holland's quintet, Mr. Nelson brings his own band to the stage, with the pianist Mulgrew Miller, the bassist Robert Hurst and the drummer Lewis Nash. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-3626, cover, $20. (Ratliff)    OREGON (Wednesday and Thursday) Celtic music, jazz, swing and classical guitar get all mixed up in the music of Oregon, a band that's been around since 1970. The band rarely comes around anymore, and the lineup is as it has been, more or less, for ages: Ralph Towner on guitar, Paul McCandless on oboe, Glen Moore on bass, Mark Walker on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212)582-2121, cover, $27.50. (Ratliff)    GRETCHEN PARLATO (Monday) The jazz singer Ms. Parlato is a newcomer of great promise: in standards, bossa novas and originals, through long tones and subtle inflections of rhythm, she deeply enters the musical field of her band. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232, cover, $15.

(Ratliff)    JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tuesday) The violinist Ms. Scheinman has made some eclectic and carefully composed records. But as these more low-key weekly gigs prove, at bottom she's a killer player, with the street musician's trick of getting attention by the power of the single, perfect note. Next week she appears with the guitarist Adam Levy. 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177 , $8.

(Ratliff)    VISION CLUB: CHARLES WATERS' GOLD SPARKLE TRIO/MARTY EHRLICH (Tomorrow) The Gold Sparkle Band has been in New York since the late 80's; it channels the East Coast jazz avant-garde of the mid-1960's. Mr. Ehrlich, one of the musicians who bridged the avant-garde with the jazz tradition in the 70's and 80's, is always exploring a worthwhile avenue with a different band. This one features the saxophonist Michael Attias, the pianist Craig Taborn and the drummer Pheeroan AkLaff.

(Ratliff)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'LA BOHÈME' (Tonight and Tomorrow) Impressive endurance, at the very least, is a hallmark of the Bronx Opera, which for 36 seasons has been offering young professionals in fully staged opera productions, on a minimal budget, with occasionally pleasing results. 8 p.m., Lovinger Theater, Lehman College, Bedford Park Boulevard West and Goulden Avenue, in the Bronx, (718)960-8833, $15 to $30.

(Jeremy Eichler)    'FAUST' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In a revelatory performance, James Levine cuts through the hokum of Gounod's ''Faust'' and captures the music's dignity and elegance. And the Met has assembled a top-rank cast, especially René Pape as Mephistopheles. Alas, the Met's new production by Andrei Serban is a jumble. Though the conductor Steven Crawford takes over for tomorrow evening's performance, Mr. Levine returns on Wednesday. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $145 and $215 remaining tomorrow, sold out on Wednesday but returns may be available. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LOST CHILDHOOD' (Wednesday) Yehuda Nir's harrowing Holocaust memoir makes a strange choice for an opera, but Janice Hamer, a composer, and Mary Azrael, a librettist, have made it into one, and the results may be powerful. 7:30 p.m., Jewish Community Center in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (646)505-4445, $20. (Allan Kozinn)    'TOSCA' (Monday and Thursday) For some, the draw is Franco Zeffirelli's lavish and historically authentic production. For others, the main attraction comes on Thursday, when the soprano Aprile Millo makes one of her now-rare Metropolitan Opera appearances in the title role. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House (see above), $26 to $170. (Midgette)    Classical Music    'THE ANDSNES PROJECT' (Tonight) The remarkable Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes concludes his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall this season with a bracing chamber music program of works by Kurtag and Schumann.

Oestreich)    SARAH CONNOLLY (Monday) If this recital is anything like as good as her New York recital debut three years ago, one should run, not walk, to hear this fine British mezzo present a program that ranges from Haydn, Brahms and Reynaldo Hahn to Korngold and Kurt Weill. 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $32.

(Oestreich)    MADAME VERA GALUPE-BORSZKH (Tonight and Tomorrow) You don't have to love opera to roar with laughter at Madame Vera, although the diva (by day, the director and voice coach Ira Siff) would frown at a term as crass as ''spoof'' for her brilliant send-ups of the singer's art. 8 p.m., Thalia at Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212)864-5400, $30, $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)    ANTON NEL (Wednesday) At his recital debut, in the late 1980's, this pianist was polished if interpretively predictable, but encounters since then suggest that he has grown considerably. Here he tackles a hefty program that runs from Mozart to John Corigliano. 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $15.

Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION: AFRICAN AMERICAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. 5 West 53rd Street (212)265-1040. (Grace Glueck)    * ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700. Also at Queens: ''Fatal Love.'' (Holland Cotter)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. Also at the design museum: ''Hella Jongerius Selects: Works From the Permanent Collection.'' 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with Revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Michael Kimmelman)    * SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Núñez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquín Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)    MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST,' through May 29. Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Kimmelman)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. (See above.) (Smith)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art, or music, this country has produced. Also at the museum: ''Chris Ofili: Afro Muses 1995-2005.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Smith)    THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944.8639. (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    * JACK GOLDSTEIN A hero of the Pictures generation revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. His films from the early 70's (from 20 seconds to five minutes long) have a cool, deadpan quality recalling early videos of William Wegman. Ed Ruscha-style paintings of lightning storms from the 80's, here and at Metro, are thrillingly cinematic. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, through May 28. (Johnson)    * KELLY KACZYNSKI A graduate of Bard College makes a debut with an apotheosis of art-about-art and optical illusion in which seemingly formless sculptures, viewed through a peephole, coalesce into an image of one of Marcel Duchamp's best-known works. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212)865-0783, through May 22. (Smith)    * 'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery,125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, through June 4. (Cotter)    * RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)    Galleries: SoHo    JOSEF ALBERS/DONALD JUDD: 'STRUCTURE AND COLOR' Despite the 40-year age difference, this vivacious museum-quality show of two geometric abstractionists -- one proto-Minimalist, the other Minimalist -- is a call and response echo chamber of levitating squares and rectangles of color. Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212)925-4338, through May 21. (Smith)    * '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLINT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' This fascinating and beautiful show presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' A video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212)462-2668, through May 28. (Smith)    DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the hand-made and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)    'COLLAGE: SIGNS AND SURFACES' Joseph Cornell, Romare Beardon, Jess, Robert Rauschenberg and other big names in collage history are on hand for this show of works by more than 70 artists. But many of the most intriguing works are by lesser knowns, like Arch Connelly's pearl-encrusted ''Self Portrait'' and Michael Cooper's ''16 Yellow Things,'' a gridded arrangement of a ticket stub, a Lego block and 14 other small, more or less yellow items. Pavel Zoubok, 533 West 23rd Street, (212)675-7490, through May 21. (Johnson)    IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child-star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212)206-3583, through June 4. (Smith)    WILL DUTY Mr. Duty uses a computer and scanned photographs to generate subtle, flickering compositions of stars, bars and flames, but he translates the imagery by hand and pencil onto paper, to dense, richly sensuous effect. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212)989-0156, through May 21. (Johnson)    ANDRÉ ETHIER A young Canadian artist makes his debut with small macabre paintings that are tender of touch and hot of color and suggest fairy tales gone wrong. Derek Eller, 526-30 West 25th Street, (212)206-6411, through May 21. (Smith)    ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)    JAMES GOBEL: 'RIDICULE IS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF' Fat Rococo-era fops pose on a striped floor against a background of snow-covered rocky peaks in a campy, mural-scale confection made of neatly assembled pieces of colored felt. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212)352-2238, through May 27. (Johnson)    'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, through May 27. (Smith)    NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree braches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)    * LAUREL NAKADATE: 'LOVE HOTEL AND OTHER STORIES' In videos of private performances, the young, fetching and scarily adventurous Ms. Nakadate toys absurdly with men who tried to pick her up and then agreed to make art with her. Danziger, 521 West 26th Street, (212)629-6778, through May 21. (Johnson)    JACKIE NICKERSON In the debut of a former fashion photographer, imposing color photographs of black South African farm workers that glamorize their poverty are shown with more recent and convincing portraits of Irish clergy. Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212)645-1701, through May 21. (Smith)    JOHN F. SIMON JR.: 'ENDLESS VICTORY' Mesmerizing, animated patterns driven by sophisticated software programs and running on laptop screens; they would make excellent screen savers. One plays inventive variations on Mondrian's ''Victory Boogie Woogie.'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646)336-7183, through May 28. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes tear drops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    * AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock-coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)    Last Chance    'CAN I GET A WITNESS' This tough little group show has a casual, camped-out feel and polymorphous themes, touching on childhood, gender roles and spiritual queasiness, neo-existential as well as evangelical. Longwood Art Project, Hostos Community College/CUNY, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, the Bronx, (718)518-6728, through Wednesday. (Cotter)    SAM KUSACK: 'PHASE THREE: SUBSTRATES' Mr. Kusack's sleek industrial fountain of aluminum, metal tubing and a supposedly real meteorite is like a prop for a science fiction movie. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)268-1520, through tomorrow. (Johnson)    SEYMOUR LIPTON: 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST SCULPTOR' His Ab Ex luster dimmed with the arrival of Minimalism, but Lipton (1903-86) vigorously explored his basic theme of humanity and its spiritual challenges until his last years. This show reaffirms his important place in 20th-century sculpture. Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212)247-0082, through tomorrow. (Glueck)    * 'MAN, THE FLOWER OF ALL FLESH' Hanne Tierney, the creator of this hourlong piece, calls it a ''theater-without-actors performance work.'' It is also installation art, sculpture, sound art and dance, and an act of magic. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7. Admisson: $20; $10 for 65+ and students. Reservations: (718)783-4438. Five Myles, 558 St. Johns Place, Crown Heights, Brooklyn. (Cotter)    THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'BYRDCLIFFE: AN AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS COLONY,' through Sunday. In its heyday this colony for artists, musicians and writers in Woodstock, N.Y., produced rugged, elegantly designed Arts and Crafts furniture, plus pottery, painting, jewelry, metalwork and textiles. The colony's spirit pervades the show in photographs and other memorabilia. 170 Central Park West, at 76th Street, (212)873-3400. (Glueck)    JIM WRIGHT: 'TWO COATS FOR THE TEMPERANCE REEL' In thick, glossy, candy-colored acrylics, Mr. Wright paints big neo-hippie pictures of guitars, musicians, magic forests and totemic animals. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)268-1520, through tomorrow.

Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737.    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Opens June 1. Elaine May's three one-acts is a new comedy on Broadway (remember those) about married couples and aging singles looking for love. It's being called a play ''about life in the new millennium.'' Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.    'DRUMSTRUCK' Previews start Thursday. Opens late May/early June. The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show.

Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Beginning Monday the theater will be renamed the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater. Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish wind-up music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us. (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real-estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialouge with such pure love for the athletics of acting? (1:45). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it too suffers from fundmental mistmatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winner (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING' Cheers to the British cabaret trio that calls itself Fascinating Aida. These women revel in the here and now. They are bawdy and political; loopy (in that crisp English way) and whimsical (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Margo Jefferson)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the two maids (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)    'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100 . (Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'PERSEUS' Performed in ancient Greek, ''Perseus'' tells the saga of the son of Zeus who slew the serpent-headed Medusa and saved Andromeda from a sea monster. Staged by Ellen Stewart, the production has the flamboyant pageantry and occasional ridiculousness of a low rent runway show (1:40). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, (212)475-7710. (Jason Zinoman)    'THE THREE MUSKETEERS' A lot of story and actors have been crammed into this musical version. Unfortunately, that seems to have left little room for other crucial ingredients, like panache (2:30). Wings, 154 Christopher Street, (212)627-2961. (Genzlinger)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large transvestite (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). 47th Street, 304 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE FALSE SERVANT' Decked out in a smart black tailcoat, Martha Plimpton cuts a debonair figure in this revival of this unusually chilly Marivaux comedy. Ms. Plimpton's dashing performance imbues the proceedings with a bright, puckish spirit, but the mechanical staging emphasizes the nip that never leaves the air (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    'THE HAPPY PRINCE' This is a lovely Scottish production of Oscar Wilde's fairy tale about a statue and a swallow who help the poor and pay a great price. Very little of the Wilde wit has survived the adaptation, but the play may prompt children to turn to his original (1:00). The New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'MONK' Rome Neal eases his way through this solo play about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, taking his time to tell the story of an artist he clearly loves. But this is not the show for jazz fans that want to delve deep into Monk's psychology or learn something new about his process (1:30). Havoc, 312 West 36th Street, (718)288-8048, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'MOONLIGHT AND MAGNOLIAS' Hollywood ghosts squabble like starving chickens in Ron Hutchinson's shrill, obstreperously silly comedy about the making of ''Gone With the Wind'' (1:50). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'ORANGE FLOWER WATER' Craig Wright's play is about two marriages coming apart. The hurt that people cause one another is communicated only through words in this play -- sometimes too many of them (1:30). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Monday. (Andrea Stevens)    'SOULS OF NAPLES' As a lovable dupe who is happier tangling with a family of phantoms than facing the cold truths of his marriage, John Turturro exudes a winsome sincerity that pleasantly perfumes Roman Paska's otherwise flaccid production of this 1946 comedy by Eduardo De Filippo (2:00). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes). A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)    'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' (G, 48 minutes). A hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome. (Stephen Holden)    'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes). Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)    'ANOTHER ROAD HOME' (not rated, 79 minutes). This fascinating film documents the Israeli director Danae Elon's attempt to reconnect with the male Palestinian caregiver who lived with her family. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'BEAUTY SHOP' (PG-13, 105 minutes). Less a sequel than an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff, this loose and genial comedy moves the ''Barbershop'' franchise to Atlanta, and gives the ladies a turn at the warm, salty banter that made the first two installments so popular. (A.O. Scott)    'THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE' (R, 112 minutes). A proud survivor of the 1960's and its utopian promise, Jack (Daniel Day-Lewis) lives alone on an island with his only daughter. A story about the limits of love, ''Ballad'' is also about the limits of idealism as well as, rather unfortunately, those of its restlessly ambitious writer and director, Rebecca Miller. (Dargis)    * 'THE BEST OF YOUTH' (not rated, 6 hours and 23 minutes, shown in two parts; in Italian). Marco Tullio Giordana's six-hour journey through recent Italian history is nothing less than a masterpiece, combining epic sweep with precise, heart-rending intimacy. (Scott)    'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' (PG-13, 111 minutes). This Bollywood-style musical -- which transposes Jane Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. (Dargis)    'CASUISTRY: THE ART OF KILLING A CAT' (not rated, 88 minutes). In 2001, three young men in Toronto tortured and killed a domestic cat and videotaped themselves doing it. This upsetting incident and its aftermath are the subjects of this documentary that will leave viewers eager to discuss the limits of artistic freedom and the extension of ''human rights'' to animals. (Dana Stevens)    'DEATH OF A DYNASTY' (R, 74 minutes). Watching Damon Dash's playful movie is like entering a room where a large, noisy party is going on and never fully adjusting to the dark or the din. A young white reporter goes behind the scenes in the hip-hop world and thinks he knows a lot more than he does. (Anita Gates)    'DOWNFALL' (not rated, 155 minutes; in German). Bruno Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses. The film's most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. (Scott)    'EATING OUT' (not rated, 85 minutes). A dreary erotic roundelay: a modern-day variant on a Shakespeare comedy, only without the verbal felicity or sense of dramatic structure. (Stevens)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes). This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)    '15' (not rated, 90 minutes, in Hokkien and Mandarin). A Singaporean film about the desultory adventures of a gang of disaffected youth starring young nonprofessional actors who aren't any good. (Stevens)    * 'FUNNY HA HA' (not rated, 89 minutes). Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)    'THE GIRL FROM MONDAY' (not rated, 84 minutes). Like so many science fiction fantasies, this deadpan comedy, which is ''Brave New World'' Lite, begins with a witty premise, then stumbles all over itself trying to tell a coherent, original story. (Holden)    'GUESS WHO' (PG-13, 103 minutes). A loose, pointless remake of ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' (Scott)    'HAPPILY EVER AFTER' (not rated, 100 minutes; in French). A likable skin-deep sex comedy, which tries half-heartedly to present itself as a treatise on marriage. (Holden)    'HITCH' (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Will Smith as a dating coach. (Scott)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes). In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish). The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'HOSTAGE' (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero. (Holden)    'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes). Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes). A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG' (R, 88 minutes). A dance club D.J. loses his hearing and then his grip in this surprisingly sweet faux documentary, while Paul Kaye keeps us interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless. (Dargis)    'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes). The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese). This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes). Two Dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French). A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MADISON' (PG, 105 minutes). This film about hydroplane racing in a small Indiana town wants to be both heartwarming and quirky but is sometimes just cutesy instead. The cast does a fine job, but only moviegoers who care about nitrous-oxide injection systems are likely to appreciate the story. (Gates)    'THE MAN WHO COPIED' (not rated, 124 minutes, in Portuguese). From kitchen-sink realism, to unconvincing caper fantasy, this Brazilian film about a photocopier-turned-counterfeiter loses its bearings the moment it leaps from one to the other. (Holden)    'MELINDA AND MELINDA' (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though Woody Allen's drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, the director interweaves them deftly enough. (Scott)    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' (PG-13, 135 minutes). Clint Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. (Scott)    * 'MILLIONS' (PG, 97 minutes). Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Danny Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. (Dargis)    'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. (Dargis)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean). The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'ONE MISSED CALL' (not rated, 100 minutes; in Japanese). Take the Japanese horror film ''Ringu,'' replace the deadly videotapes with killer cellphones, and add a baroque, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink climactic sequence involving ghosts, zombies, disembodied limbs and pickled fetuses. Are you sure you want to take this call? (Stevens)    'THE PACIFIER' (PG, 97 minutes). Despite the specter of boogeymen, this family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. (Ned Martel)    'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes). The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes). This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SAVE THE GREEN PLANET' (not rated, 118 minutes; in Korean). A dog named Earth and aliens both domestic and imported rotate around one another in this self-consciously freaky, rambunctiously goofy genre hybrid from South Korea. Just don't ask what it all means. (Dargis)    'SHORT CUT TO NIRVANA: KUMBH MELA' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Hindi). Seventy million pilgrims gather in India to seek enlightenment; this engaging documentary travelogue, as the title suggests, will save you the trip. (Scott)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes). Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    'STALIN'S WIFE' (not rated, 104 minutes; in English and Russian). This dense biographical collage of images and memories of the Soviet dictator's second wife, Nadezhda, has a paradoxical quality. While many of the facts of her life are in dispute, the film evokes a fairly defined portrait of a strong, decisive, well-educated woman destroyed by a paranoid husband. (Holden)    'STATE PROPERTY II' (R, 94 minutes). Better than the first one, which isn't saying much, but this brutal celebration of the spirit of capitalism has some moments of energy and wit. (Scott)    * '3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean). A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)    * 'TORREMOLINOS 73' (not rated, 91 minutes, in Spanish). This movie's gentle, humanist vision of pornographic filmmaking as a sexual and aesthetic act of emancipation is a far cry from the graphic social realism of recent films like ''A Hole in My Heart.'' (Stevens)    * 'À TOUTE DE SUITE' (not rated, 96 minutes; in French). This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)    'THE TUNNEL' (not rated, 157 minutes; in German). While the Berlin Wall stood, countless tunnels were planned as escape routes. This emotionally gripping film recounts the digging of the most famous one. (Laura Kern)    'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen to do some marvelous work. (Scott)    'WALK ON WATER' (not rated, 104 minutes). The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax and a cloying conclusion, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (not rated, 45 minutes). A choppy, bumpy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Martel)    'WINTER SOLSTICE' (R, 93 minutes). This is the kind of ambling, event-free family drama that will either draw audiences in with its understated power, or quietly bore them out of their skulls. (Stevens)    'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (né O'Shea Jackson).

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' through July 10.

The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through January 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)    MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST' Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises tucked in. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'BYRDCLIFFE: AN AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS COLONY,' through May 15. In its heyday this colony for artists, musicians and writers in Woodstock, N.Y., produced rugged, elegantly designed Arts and Crafts furniture, plus pottery, painting, jewelry, metalwork and textiles. The colony's spirit pervades the show in photographs and other memorabilia. 170 Central Park West, at 76th Street, (212)873-3400. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art, or music, this country has produced. Also at the museum: ''Chris Ofili: Afro Muses 1995-2005.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)    THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3633. (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-24538639. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    ERNST LUDWIG KIRCHNER: 'DRAWINGS' The German Expressionist applied his sharp insights and rapid sketching facility to everything; the feelingness of his line gives strong emotional power to this show. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212)988-1623, through May 14. (Glueck)    JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through June 4. (Johnson)    * WAYNE THIEBAUD 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, through May 27. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    JOSEF ALBERS/DONALD JUDD: 'STRUCTURE AND COLOR' Despite the 40-year age difference, this vivacious museum-quality show of two geometric abstractionists -- one proto-Minimalist, the other Minimalist -- is a call and response echo chamber of levitating squares and rectangles of color. Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212)925-4338, through May 21. (Smith)    TERAO KATSUHIRO, SHINKI TOMOYUKI, YOSHIMUNE KAZUHIRO, YUMOTO MITSUO Four artists, from a Japanese facility for the artistically talented mentally disabled, appear possessed of naïve but intense imaginations and formal predilections bordering on compulsive. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212)925-1200, through May. (Johnson)    * '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLINT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' This fascinating and beautiful show presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' A video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212)462-2668, through May 28. (Smith)    MOYNA FLANNIGAN: 'A PIE IN THE KISSER' Ms. Flannigan, who teaches in Glasgow, makes queasily erotic paintings of older, Rococo-era women, which owe much to John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage. But she has her own suave painterly touch, a smoldering palette of muted reds and greens and a zanily morbid sense of humor. Sara Meltzer, 516 West 20th Street, (212)727-9330, through May 14. (Johnson)    SAM KUSACK: 'PHASE THREE: SUBSTRATES' Mr. Kusack's sleek industrial fountain of cut-out aluminum, metal tubing and a supposedly real meteorite is like a prop for a science fiction movie. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through May 14. (Johnson)    'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, through May 27. (Smith)    QIU SHIHUA: 'INSIGHT' At first, the canvases by this painter from Shenzhen, China, look like nothing more than slightly scuffed expanses of raw fabric. Look again and you discover peaceful, luminously misty landscapes realized with amazing subtlety. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212)414-1169, through May 28. (Johnson)    MICHAEL RYAN Using his training in the art of decorative marbleizing, this self-taught painter creates dreamy, primordial landscapes sparsely populated by bizarrely abstracted animals and people. Together, the brushy painting and the visionary imagery create a scary, feverish feeling. Edlin, 529 West 20th Street, (212)206-9723, through June 4. (Johnson)    ANGELA STRASSHEIM: 'LEFT BEHIND' The large, extraordinarily vivid color photographs in this New York solo debut have a subtly gripping archetypal magic. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212)627-3363, through May 14. (Johnson)    JOAN WALLACE, 'VIOLENT POP PAINTINGS' Each of three videos set into white monochrome panels shows a white-frosted cake exploded in slow motion by a shotgun blast. Ms. Wallace invites us to read this as a commentary on Modernist purity, the shooting of Andy Warhol and the assassination of President Kennedy. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212)947-2818, through May 28. (Johnson)    JIM WRIGHT: 'TWO COATS FOR THE TEMPERANCE REEL' In thick, glossy, candy-colored acrylics, Mr. Wright paints big neo-hippie pictures of guitars, musicians, magic forests and totemic animals. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through May 14. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    * ALBERTO CASADO: 'TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, (212)219-0473, through June 25. (Johnson)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, which has meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, Meatpacking District, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    ''GLASS, SERIOUSLY'' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes tear drops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    Last Chance    * 'SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'HUGO BOSS PRIZE 2004: RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA,' through Wednesday. For his solo show, Mr. Tiravanija built a low-power television station from inexpensive materials and papered the gallery's walls with instructions on how anyone and everyone can do the same, raising issues of government control and First Amendment rights. (See above.) (Cotter)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'SURREALISM USA,' through Sunday. Surrealism shook American arts, and this high-spirited exhibition examines the fallout with a wide-angle lens. It presents 120 works by more than 60 artists, from Europeans in exile to Abstract Expressionists to the often forgotten. 1083 Fifth Avenue, near 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    * LUCAS SAMARAS: 'PHOTOFLICKS (IMOVIES) AND PHOTOFICTIONS (A TO Z)' Sixty short, surrealistic home-made digital movies and 4,432 still images by an extraordinarily inventive, versatile and idiosyncratic artist. His best gallery show in years. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)421-3293, through tomorrow. (Johnson)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CY TWOMBLY: FIFTY YEARS OF WORKS ON PAPER,' through Sunday. This show starts in the 1950's, with a personal anti-aesthetic in which scribbling was draftsmanship, and gouging and scratching were gestural painting. After a move to Italy, words appeared. Later the work turns lush, into a kind of horticultural expressionism that is appetizing and uningratiating. (See above.)
