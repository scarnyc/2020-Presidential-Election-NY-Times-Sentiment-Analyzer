0,Just a few committee seats remain open for an incoming senator.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/blogs/23thecaucus-few-comm8653.html,Just a few committee seats remain open for an incoming senator.,"When Kirsten Gillibrand makes her way from the House, across the Capitol Rotunda, to join the ranks of Senate Democrats, she will find slim pickings in terms of committee assignments. And yet, among the few vacancies still available, some are likely to hold huge appeal for the woman about to become the youngest senator.  Senate Democrats earlier this week announced final committee assignments, with just a few slots left for the three senators who at that point had yet to take office: Michael F. Bennet who was sworn in on Thursday replaces Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado; Al Franken who is eventually expected to be seated as the senator from Minnesota; and Governor David A. Paterson's choice to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton from New York.  Senate Democrats, anticipating that Caroline Kennedy might be that designee, had left open a seat on the Environment and Public Works committee, figuring that would be a high-profile appointment and one she would find appealing.  Ms. Gillibrand may covet other assignments. In the House, she sits on the Armed Services and Agriculture committees.   Although the Senate Armed Services Committee is full, there is one seat remaining on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Ms. Gillibrand, who holds a degree in Asian Studies from Dartmouth College, would seem a good fit. Also, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who once held the seat Ms. Gillibrand would fill, was a longtime senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee.  There are also two seats open on the agriculture committee, and though it would be a break from recent history for a New Yorker to serve on that panel it might also highlight Ms. Gillibrand's roots in upstate New York that set her apart from New York City's liberal establishment.  New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, serves on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, the Finance and Judiciary committees, the Rules Committee, of which he will be chairman; and the Joint Economic Committee.   There is an open seat on the Health, Education, Pension and Labor Committee, chaired by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, but that would seem to be a perfect slot for Mr. Bennet, who was the superintendent of schools in Denver. Mr. Bennet has requested a seat on the Agriculture Committee and is also likely to fill the one vacancy on the Indian Affairs Committee, given Colorado's Native American population.  Beyond that, there are three openings on the Special Committee on Aging; one opening on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, one opening on the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and the seat on the Environment and Public Works Committee that Democratic leaders had been eying for Ms. Kennedy.  It is hard to predict when Mr. Franken will be sworn into the Senate, given the ongoing court challenge to the election results in Minnesota, or what his committee assignments might be.   Minnesota is already represented on the agriculture committee and the environment committee by Senator Amy Klobuchar, though occasionally senators from the same state overlap in their assignments.

7,Let the ballot battle begin.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/blogs/19thecaucus-minnesot7533.html,Let the ballot battle begin.,"Get used to it. From today through probably mid-December, the ballot-by-ballot progress of the statewide recount in Minnesota's bitter Senate race will provoke at least daily firing rounds (and boasts of leads, however minute) between the two campaigns.  As the manual recount started today, officials with the campaign of Senator Norm Coleman sought to reassure supporters that while the vote totals may ""swing wildly from day to day,"" they were confident the Republican lawmaker would hold onto his seat.  But Mr. Coleman's challenger, Al Franken, held his own on Wednesday. He traveled to Washington for meetings with Senate leaders, including Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, Charles E. Schumer of New York and the woman who may (or may not) be his future colleague, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.  According to a spokesman for the Franken campaign, the Democratic candidate gave the senators an update on the recount process and they briefed him on the party's legislative agenda. When he emerged from one of his meetings on Capitol Hill he reportedly said that he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his chances.  Although Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said that as of Wednesday morning the race started over ""at zero,"" in the final tally before the recount, Mr. Franken was trailing Mr. Coleman by 215 votes.   The slim margin has the Franken campaign looking for every last vote. A judge's ruling on Wednesday compelled one Minnesota county to turn over information on absentee voters whose ballots were rejected. The Franken team is trying to obtain similar data from each of the state's 87 counties, looking for evidence of any irregularities.  The Franken campaign also has a related request, pending with the state canvassing board, for a review of rejected absentee ballots.   Thousands of volunteer representatives from both campaigns fanned out across the state to observe the process and challenge ballots that may have been miscounted. The secretary of state's office plans to post regular updates of the recount results as precincts complete the painstaking process of counting each of the nearly 3 million votes by hand.  The Coleman campaign turned its Web site into a real-time ticker of recount developments, and both candidates are raising money to keep their campaigns afloat until a winner is declared.  Elections officials have set a goal of Dec. 5 to complete the counting, and the state canvassing board plans to reconvene on Dec. 16 to review all the challenged ballots.
