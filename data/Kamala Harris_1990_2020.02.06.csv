Battle Over Police Records | Jeff Adachi, the San Francisco public defender, accused District Attorney Kamala Harris of unethical behavior on Tuesday. Ms. Harris fired back that Mr. Adachi’s comments were “irresponsible.” The district attorney’s office failed to research and disclose the criminal and misconduct histories of about 80 police officers who testified in trials, according to The San Francisco Chronicle. By law, the officers’ histories should have been revealed to defense lawyers, who could have used the information to challenge their credibility as witnesses in court. Ms. Harris called Mr. Adachi’s assertion that hundreds of convictions could be in jeopardy “wild speculation” and “playing politics with public safety.” Meanwhile, the SF Weekly reports that Ms. Harris now has the lowest felony trial conviction rate of any big-city district attorney in the state. She is the front-runner to become the Democratic Party nominee in the race for California attorney general. [The San Francisco Chronicle, SF Weekly]",,,The New York Times,[],[],2010-05-05T11:33:44+0000,article,,U.S.,,,nyt://article/6c49fc90-4bb2-5211-b569-74c6bb0cd559,888,nyt://article/6c49fc90-4bb2-5211-b569-74c6bb0cd559,Sampler: District Attorney in Hot Seat; Tonga Room in Preservation Fight,Bay Area,,,,,,By Katharine Mieszkowski,"[{'firstname': 'Katharine', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Mieszkowski', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",

Some prisoners may be released early for completing drug or education programs. Part of the plan includes changing how the state handles parolees, many of whom, at the moment, return to prison on technical violations, according to criminal system experts. California is the only state that places all prisoners on parole at release, but now hundreds of low-level offenders will be released without close supervision from their parole officers. The effort represents a “seismic shift,” said Joan Petersilia, a criminologist at Stanford Law School and a longtime scholar of the state’s prisons. The prison system costs the state $8 billion annually, about 11 percent of the state budget.
