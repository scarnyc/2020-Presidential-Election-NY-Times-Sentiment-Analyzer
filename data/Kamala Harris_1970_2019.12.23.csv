Mr. Darcy becomes Marcy in this gender-switching musical retelling of ''Pride and Prejudice,'' which stars Stephane D'Abruzzo from ''Avenue Q'' (2:00).

Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101.    Broadway    'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Tuesday, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER'  A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION'  An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255. (Genzlinger)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)         Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    * 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE OTHER SIDE'  In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Anne Midgette)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'APRIL'S SHOWER' (No rating, 98 minutes) A lighthearted comedy about the outing of a bride-to-be and her five-year relationship with her maid of honor. Though filled with sitcom-ready stereotypes, ''April's Shower'' presents a refreshingly volatile view of sexual orientation. As faces are slapped and partners are switched, the movie leaves you with the feeling that gay is good, but bi can be even better. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)    * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)    'EL CARRO' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Pleasant but slight, this sociological farce from Colombia tells the story of a vintage convertible that changes the lives of the middle-class Velez family to mildly humorous effect. (Nathan Lee)    * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)    'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile.(Laura Kern)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)    'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE'  (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)    'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee)    'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee)    * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)    * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)    'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)    'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)    * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career and the most anguished. (Dargis)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)    'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Lee)    'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott)    * 'STATE OF FEAR: THE TRUTH ABOUT TERRORISM' (No rating, 94 minutes, in English and Spanish) Based on more than 16,000 testimonies to the Peruvian Truth & Reconciliation Commission, Pamela Yates's harrowing documentary chronicles the 20 years of terror between the rise of the Maoist leader Abimael Guzmán and his Shining Path guerrillas, and the November 2000 overthrow of President Alberto Fujimori's corrupt dictatorship. Together with ''The Montesinos Media Buy,'' seven minutes of surveillance video depicting the Fujimori regime's media bribery, ''State of Fear'' is a timely lesson on the hazards of choosing security over democracy. (Catsoulis)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manqué never develops any stamina. (Holden)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    Film Series    FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program is presenting a series of 11 feature films and 2 shorts by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82). This weekend's film is ''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' (1972), about a depressed fruit peddler in a loveless marriage. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Anita Gates)    FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Feb. 12) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. This weekend's films are ''Hamsun'' (1996), selected by Peter Rainer, starring Max Von Sydow as the Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun; ''Naked Lunch'' (1991), selected by Stuart Klawans, David Cronenberg's interpretation of William S. Burroughs's novel; and ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'' (1976), selected by Stephen Whitty, in which David Bowie plays a visitor from another planet. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    NEW YORK JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL (Through Jan. 26) The 15th annual program, sponsored by the Jewish Museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center, continues this weekend with half a dozen films. They include Mari Cantu's ''Rosehill'' (2004), set during the 1956 Hungarian revolution; ''The Living Orphan'' (1939), Joseph Seiden's melodrama about a theater couple on the Lower East Side; and the world premiere of Ira Wohl's ''Best Sister'' (2005), a portrait of the director's 80-year-old sister. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    NORDIC OSCAR CONTENDERS (Through next Friday) Scandinavia House is screening three of the five 2005 films from Nordic countries selected for Oscar consideration.

(Gates)    PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION (Through Feb. 6) A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. Tonight's films are ''Toy Story 2'' (1999) and two Oscar-winning shorts, ''Geri's Game'' (1997), about an old man playing chess, and ''For the Birds'' (2000), about a group of snobbish feathered friends. ''Monsters Inc.'' (2001) will be shown on Monday and Thursday. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ACT LOCAL HURRICANE BENEFIT (Sunday) The charity group Act Local presents an all-day benefit show for the Southern Arts Federation Emergency Relief Fund, which aids musicians affected by last year's hurricanes. More than 30 local musical acts are scheduled to perform, including the Wrens, Nada Surf, Estevez and Langhorne Slim. All Ages. 1 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Laura Sinagra)    AKRON/FAMILY, MI AND L'AU, WOODEN WAND (Tomorrow) This bill sandwiches the whispery Finland-based folk duo Mi and L'au between two weirder acts: the layered and deceptively melodic Akron/Family, a quiescent lo-fi quartet that explores the dark crannies and latent explosiveness of Americana, and Wooden Wand (a k a James Toth), who mixes modal guitars with mutters and yawps that suggest a Pentecostal drunk. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sinagra)    BURNSIDE PROJECT (Tonight) The Burnside Project plays its guitars in the intermittently splashing indie-rock style of the slacker 90's but uses electronic burbles beneath. 8, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra)    CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN, TRAMPLED BY TURTLES (Tomorrow) The 80's college-rock jokesters Camper van Beethoven recently reunited to release a concept album about a dystopian California. The electric bluegrass band Trampled by Turtles opens. 10 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country résumé that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 8 and 10, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, between Second and Third Streets, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra)    OLU DARA, RICHIE HAVENS (Monday) The cornetist Olu Dara leads a group that takes an amiable approach to a stream of good-time American music that runs from old jazz and blues to funk; he keeps audiences happy. An unswerving 60's holdout, Richie Havens is still strumming his guitar with untrammeled momentum, still singing in his grainy baritone and still bringing earnest drama out of protests and stubborn optimism. 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    THE ENGLISH BEAT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dave Wakeling still performs under the name of his old Birmingham band, which in the 80's mastered a soulful version of British ska and had hits with songs like the jittery ''Mirror in the Bathroom.'' 8, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    MARK EITZEL (Tonight) The American Music Club's Mark Eitzel continues his conspiratorial wallowing and baritone complaints, with increasingly electronic beats of late. The sad-folk outfit Last Town Chorus also plays. 8:30, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sinagra)    GOLDEN FESTIVAL (Tonight and Tomorrow) Featuring the energetic Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band, which plays dance music in the Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian and Romany traditions, this two-day festival of regional Balkan dance and music begins with a program that will include John Parish, the Greek-Macedonian Kavala Band and the Scandinavian Loretta Kelley before a midnight Zlatne Uste show. Some of the more than 50 performers filling tomorrow's three performance spaces hail from places like Bulgaria, Slovakia and Macedonia, but the bill also includes admirers from Norway, Iran and Louisiana.

Tomorrow at 6 p.m., Good Shepherd School, 620 Isham, near 207th Street, Inwood, (718) 859-4759; $30; students, $20; children, $8. (Sinagra)    HARD-FI (Tuesday) Using dub tactics like ominous echoes and faraway sirens to add dimension to its paranoid but melodic arena punk sound, this British band creates a more cavernous and even cinematic space than most. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    HUUN-HUUR-TU (Tomorrow) Cowboys from Tuva, where Siberia meets Mongolia, cultivate the technique of throat singing: producing a deep bass note and two or three harmonics above it, all at the same time. Tibetan monks use a similar technique for Buddhist chants. Huun-Huur-Tu uses the style for ancient herding songs and newer material. It is an eerie, riveting sound, like a growl linked to whistling winds, and it seems both raw and timeless. 8 p.m., Leonard Nimoy Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Pareles)    JAZZANOVA (Sunday) Alexander Barck performs as an ambassador of Berlin's Jazzanova, an electronic music collective that has always placed an emphasis on groove over glitch. 10 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, meatpacking district, (212) 645-5700; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) Freedy Johnston's finely turned country-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor. But for all their classic symmetry, they're the confessions of desperate, unsavory and unbalanced characters. 7:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Pareles)    B. B. KING: TRIBUTE TO MARTIN LUTHER KING (Sunday) The bluesman B. B. King's falsetto vocal flips and vibrato guitar licks have been an indelible influence on the blues and rock traditions. He made his musical reputation in Memphis, which is also where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. died. This Sunday, on the eve of Martin Luther King Day, he plays a show in the civil rights leader's honor. 7 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $35 to $100. (Sinagra)    THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco ornamented by clang and Moog-like warps. It's the sound of postindustrial slackers having a party in a junk shop, dancing freely. 9 p.m., Supreme Trading, 213 North Eighth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4224; free with R.S.V.P. at www.crashinin.com. (Sinagra)    KOOL KEITH, SLUM VILLAGE (Tomorrow) The shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith's Ultramagnetic MC's were a critical hit in the late 80's, helping to nudge old school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. Solo, he created personae like Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom, though his intricate, zany rhymes have grown less rewarding over time. Detroit's Slum Village also plays. 11:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    LYCAON PICTUS (Tomorrow) Aaron Diskin used to play with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' kinetic, stinging guitarist Nick Zinner, but Mr. Diskin's music for the synthesizer-bass-drum trio Lycaon Pictus is darker, recalling the apocalypse imagined by forerunners like Pere Ubu. 8 p.m., Kingsland Tavern, 244 Nassau Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-9883; $5. (Sinagra)    PABLO MAYOR AND FOLKLORE URBANO, FORRÓ FOR ALL (Thursday) Pablo Mayor's Folklore Urbano gives Colombian folk some modern inflections. Rob Curto's Forró for All plays bouncy accordion-based party music from northeastern Brazil. 7:30 p.m., Makor Steinhardt Building, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan; $12. (Sinagra)    MI AND L'AU (Tonight) The Finnish singer Mi and the French musician L'au, after becoming a couple in Paris, reportedly moved to the woods in Finland to record what they will showcase here, a cache of austere, wintery bedroom folk. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sinagra)    ELIZABETH MITCHELL: YOU ARE MY FLOWER (Tomorrow) Like several indie-rockers, the soft-pop band Ida's Elizabeth Mitchell and Daniel Littleton have turned to making kids' music lately. Their approach takes the form of reinterpreting classic folk songs. Here Ms. Mitchell plays and sings selections from that repertory. 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, (212) 864-5400; $14; members and children, $10; Just Kidding Club members, $5. (Sinagra)    ALEC OUNSWORTH, PURE HORSEHAIR, MICHAEL LEVITON (Tomorrow) The frontman of the local rock band Clap Your Hands Say Yeah has a side project with members of Ida, Boss Tweed and Ill Ease. Also on the bill are Pure Horsehair (a k a Garrett Devoe), a fingerpicking folk-pop songwriter, and Michael Leviton, who plays sea shanties on the ukulele. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra)    MIGUEL POVEDA WITH GIOVANNI HIDALGO (Thursday through Jan. 21) Th0e raspy drama of traditional flamenco singing arrives in a new generation with Miguel Poveda, an award-winning flamenco vocalist. He plays here with Giovanni Hidalgo, a percussionist who can make his conga drums crackle, slide, sing melodies and just about talk. 7:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Sinagra)    THE ROLLING STONES, METRIC (Wednesday) The Stones' newest album is their most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages, the Stones even seem politically relevant. Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Haines, Metric finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Haines's shuddering alto functions as both a weapon and a come-on. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra)    RYE COALITION (Tonight) Rye Coalition began as an angular rock band in the style of Fugazi but now mixes in more elements of 70's hard rock. Shelby also plays. 9:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $8. (Sinagra)    SUFJAN STEVENS (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter and banjoist is imbued with a Coplandesque musical vision and an expansive narcissism reminiscent of Walt Whitman's, though his lyrics can overreach and his compositions veer into the folksily baroque. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800; $20 to $45 (sold out). (Sinagra)    SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK (Sunday) Gospel, blues, African rhythms, protest songs and the joys of harmony are the enduring touchstones of this all-women a cappella group, which never forgets to leaven righteousness with pleasure. 2 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $8. (Pareles)    THE SYN (Tuesday) Back when the Who used to play the Marquee, the Syn used to open for them. One band member, Chris Squire, went on to become way more famous as the bassist with Yes. Forty years later, the Syn have re-formed to play their old proto-prog tunes and make new music as well. 7 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Sinagra)    KT TUNSTALL (Tuesday) A British singer nominated for a Mercury Prize, KT Tunstall takes breaks from her preferred 70's folk-pop to explore dance music and quieter, rootsier styles. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12 (sold out). (Sinagra)    THE WRENS (Tonight) These noise-artist rockers write about life in their home state of New Jersey, but not with a Fountains of Wayne smirk. With their routinely understated, meditative albums and their intense, up-tempo live shows, they offer two different responses to suburban tensions. 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 (sold out).(Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden)    ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)    'SINGING ASTAIRE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This smart, airy revue, which pays tribute to Fred Astaire, has returned, featuring Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. (Barbara Fasano fills in for Ms. Kole tomorrow.) 5:30 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; $30, with a $10 minimum. (Holden)    * ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, Ms. Stritch weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue of her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $125; dinner, required, is served at 6:30.

(Chinen)    THE BAD PLUS (Wednesday and Thursday) The pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer David King piqued jazz purists a few years ago with a spate of irreverent cover tunes; ''Suspicious Activity?''

(Chinen)    SAM BARDFELD QUINTET (Wednesday) Mr. Bardfeld, a violinist with a wide-ranging résumé, regroups the core musicians from his coolly evocative recent album ''Periodic Trespasses (The Saul Cycle)'' (Fresh Sound New Talent): the trumpeter Ron Horton, the vibraphonist Tom Beckham, the bassist Sean Conly and the drummer Satoshi Takeishi. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8 per set.

(Chinen)    ANDY BEY (Tonight) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a burnished falsetto and a rich baritone; he brings a quartet to the Allen Room as part of the ''American Songbook'' series presented by Lincoln Center. 8:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, www.lincolncenter.org; $30 to $55.

(Chinen)    KENNY GARRETT QUARTET/HIROMI (Tuesday through Jan. 22) Mr. Garrett is a forceful and propulsive personality on the alto saxophone; Hiromi is a diminutive yet dynamic presence on electric keyboards and piano. Both artists favor tight ensembles, although that commonality doesn't quite explain this odd double bill. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen)    ROY HARGROVE AND MULGREW MILLER (Sunday) Mr. Hargrove, the trumpeter, and Mr. Miller, the pianist, share a postbop language especially rooted in the blues; their duo performance comes under the banner of chamber jazz, but the music they concoct should make the term seem quaint. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25. Mr. Miller also plays with his trio tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25.

(Chinen)    ROBERT HURST GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Hurst, a bassist with a deep and earthy tone, has long been a resourceful small-group composer, as well as an underappreciated bandleader. This weekend he applies those talents to two distinct crews: a next-generation quartet with the pianist Robert Glasper, the guitarist Lionel Loueke and the drummer Karriem Riggins (tonight); and a quintet of somewhat more experienced peers, like the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the alto saxophonist Donald Harrison and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson (tomorrow). 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    INGRID JENSEN QUINTET (Thursday) A fiery postbop trumpeter with a book of smart original tunes, Ms. Jensen performs here with the same rhythm section featured on her new album, ''At Sea'' (ArtistShare): the guitarist Lage Lund, the keyboardist Geoffrey Keezer, the bassist Matt Clohesy and the drummer Jon Wikan. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    GRETCHEN PARLATO (Tomorrow; Tuesday through Jan. 21) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a continuing deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, which is never more pronounced than when she performs with the guitarist Lionel Loueke. Tomorrow at 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. Tuesday through Thursday at 11 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $10, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    RE:ARRANGED: THE MUSIC OF JACO PASTORIUS, GIL EVANS, LENNON & McCARTNEY (Through Sunday) The sweep of this project, which clearly runs the risk of incoherence, could be a perfect challenge for the pianist and accordionist Gil Goldstein, one of the most resourceful arrangers in jazz today. Just as promising is the lineup, featuring the trumpeter Randy Brecker, the saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, the bassist Richard Bona, the percussionist Don Alias, and an improvising string trio led by the violinist Joyce Hammann. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    CHRIS POTTER TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Potter is among the small number of tenor saxophonists to have absorbed both Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane and emerged sounding like his own man; he appears here in the setting that both predecessors helped popularize, backed only by bass (Scott Colley) and drums (Jeff Ballard). 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)    TIM RIES AND THE ROLLING STONES PROJECT (Thursday) Mr. Ries, a tenor and soprano saxophonist who has toured extensively with the rock 'n' roll institution mentioned here, rearranges a handful of its signature hits, smoothing many of the rough edges but also uncovering ample opportunities for improvisation. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist with a cool tone and a thoughtfully off-kilter sensibility, leads an ensemble consisting of Sam Sadigursky on tenor and soprano saxophones, Eliot Cardinaux on keyboards, Mike Gamble on guitar, Thomas Morgan on bass and Tyshawn Sorey on drums. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m., Detour, 349 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 533-6212; cover, $5. Thursday at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762; no cover.(Chinen)    WALLACE RONEY SEXTET (Through Sunday) On the recent album ''Mystikal'' (High Note), Mr. Roney advanced a variety of Afrocentric futurism inherited and adapted from his trumpet mentor Miles Davis; he explores similar territory in an ensemble with Robert Irving on piano, Clarence Seay on bass, Eric Allen on drums, Val Jeanty on turntables and his brother, Antoine Roney, on tenor and soprano saxophone. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25 to $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel is almost certainly the most widely hailed jazz guitarist under 40, especially among musicians; his deeply sympathetic rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner provides the focal point of this shadowy and slippery ensemble, which also includes Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Eric Harland on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    YOSVANY TERRY GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Terry, a saxophonist and percussionist, chases postbop ideals without abandoning the rhythmic pull of his native Cuba; in this ensemble, he plays alongside the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, the guitarist Mike Moreno, the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Yunior Terry, the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts and the percussionist Pedro Martinez. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15.(Chinen)    MICHAEL WEISS QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Weiss, a pianist with extensive sideman credits in the jazz mainstream, turns the spotlight toward his own compositions, including a commissioned suite called ''Three Doors''; his band includes Steve Wilson on alto and soprano saxophones, Ugonna Okegwo on bass, Daniel Sadownick on percussion and Adam Cruz on drums. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    * RANDY WESTON AND FRIENDS (Tomorrow) The pianism of Randy Weston can recall that of Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, but as a composer he has long reached beyond strict jazz traditions; this concert, dubbed ''The Spirit of Afrika,'' will commemorate the year of his 80th birthday with an assortment of friends, including the saxophonists Billy Harper and Cecil Payne, the trombonist Benny Powell, the trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater and the conga virtuoso Candido. 8 p.m., Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, Long Island University, 1 University Place, at DeKalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, ext. 2229, or www.651ARTS.org; $35, $45 and $80. (Chinen)    REGGIE WORKMAN'S BREW (Tuesday) Mr. Workman's bass playing has always evinced a graceful athleticism and an attunement to texture; here he organizes a setting that should emphasize both traits, in a trio with Miya Masaoka on koto and Gerry Hemingway on percussion. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $15. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    AVALON STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) Since its founding in 1995 at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in Connecticut, this dynamic ensemble has won several notable competitions and secured coveted residencies, most recently at Indiana University. Tomorrow it gives the second of two intriguing programs exploring the frontiers of Romanticism. Here two of Beethoven's ''Razumovsky'' Quartets (Op. 59, Nos. 2 and 3) bracket Webern's ''Langsamer Satz.'' 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Anthony Tommasini)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Mark Peskanov, the president and executive director of Bargemusic, is a great bear of a man who plays a sweet violin. This weekend he and Gerald Robbins are tackling all 10 of Beethoven's sonatas for violin and piano -- the first five tonight, Nos. 6-10 tomorrow and Sunday -- as part of a series called ''Concert and Conversations.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083; $35; $25 for students.

(Midgette)    BRONX OPERA (Tomorrow and Sunday) There are some -- O.K., maybe it's just me -- who consider Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' the perfect opera: a wrenching story, spectacular vocal and ensemble music, and it all clocks in at about 50 minutes. The enterprising Bronx Opera has paired this story of royal passion and supernatural mischief with Chabrier's ''Incomplete Education,'' a light piece about a young newlywed's search for information on how to proceed. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., the Lovinger Theater at Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $15 to $30. (Allan Kozinn)    CHAMBERFEST (Tuesday through Thursday) You might think that the Juilliard School had enough to handle with its ambitious musical celebration of its centenary, not to mention the annual Focus festival, coming up at the end of the month. But this week the school is also presenting this series of free concerts of diverse chamber works performed by accomplished student musicians. There are piano trios by Ives and Shostakovich; works by Beethoven and Dvorak will jostle against works by Stravinsky and Morton Feldman. For those who like large-scale chamber pieces, there is Mendelssohn's rousing Octet. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. at Paul Hall at the Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street; Wednesday at 1 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406.

Among the highlights are ''Mysteries of the Macabre'' and ''Aventures/Nouvelles Aventures'' tonight; Mr. Aimard's performance of a handful of the knucklebreaking Études on Sunday; and a program for strings and winds on Tuesday, with Imani Winds and the Brentano String Quartet, as well as solo works played by the cellist Clancy Newman and the violist Paul Neubauer.

(Kozinn)    'COMPOSER=PERFORMER' (Thursday) Adventurous programming has been part of Symphony Space's calendar on and off over the years, but lately the hall seems intent on joining the Miller Theater as a new-music center on the Upper West Side. In ''Composer=Performer,'' it offers music written and performed by Todd Reynolds, one of the violinists in the quartet Ethel; Joan La Barbara, who is known for her range-stretching vocalizing; and John King, a guitarist and violinist who will offer a preview of a score he is writing for the Mannheim Ballet. 7:30 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $21; $16 for students and 65+.

(Midgette)    THOMAS HAMPSON (Thursday) This American baritone has long been acclaimed for his insightful singing of German lieder, but he is also a champion of American song. In collaboration with the Library of Congress, Mr. Hampson is embarking on an 11-city American tour with a program that covers American song from the 1700's to the present. There will be psalms, hymns, folk songs, cowboy songs, spirituals and art songs -- not just by familiar composers like Bernstein and Copland but also by influential (and overlooked) composers like Arthur Farwell and Elinor Remick Warren. Wolfram Rieger will be the pianist. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $72.(Tommasini)    MANHATTAN STRING QUARTET (Tuesday) Thirty-five years old and going strong, this group is presenting a complete cycle of the Shostakovich quartets during its residency at St. Bart's.

(Midgette)    MEREDITH MONK YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Sunday) Ms. Monk, the eclectic and soulful composer-singer-performance artist, has spent the last week working with a group of young singers with impressive backgrounds in contemporary music and performance, teaching them the rudiments of her own distinctive vocal technique. Sunday's concluding concert presents those singers in an evening of Ms. Monk's work, including excerpts from her opera ''Atlas.'' 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15. (Midgette)    MUSIC OFF THE WALLS (Sunday) ''Manufactured Landscapes,'' the Brooklyn Museum's exhibition of Edward Burtynsky's photographs, ends on Sunday, but just as these pictures of industrial sites are about to be packed up, musicians from the Brooklyn Philharmonic will offer a program of chamber works that also evoke landscapes, natural and industrial. The composers are Debussy, Varèse, Cage, John Luther Adams and Theodore Wiprud. 3 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 488-5913; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)    NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Sunday) Neeme Jarvi leads his New Jersey players in the first installment of ''The Many Faces of Mozart,'' a festival -- among the first of roughly a gazillion scheduled around the world this year -- celebrating the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth. The concert's title, ''Mozart's Autumn Years,'' is a bit odd for a composer who died at 35, but you get the idea: included are late works, including the Symphony No. 41 and the incomparably beautiful Clarinet Concerto, with Karl Herman as the soloist. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Tuesday) The Juilliard School continues its centennial celebrations with a free program organized by the New York Festival of Song, titled ''100 Years of Juilliard Composers in Song.''

(Dunning)    'THE JUILLIARD SCHOOL, 1905-2005: CELEBRATING 100 YEARS'  (Today and tomorrow) This is the closing weekend for this free multimedia exhibition on one of the nation's most influential performing conservatories, whose history is depicted in photographs, playbills, correspondence, musical scores, and audiotapes and videos of classes and performances of music, theater and dance. Today and tomorrow from noon to 6 p.m., New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-1630 or www.nyp.org. Six speakers, including Linda Kent and Lawrence Rhodes, will participate in a free panel discussion on the recent history of the school's dance division. Tomorrow at 3 p.m. in the library's Bruno Walter Auditorium, (212) 642-0142. (Dunning)    BRENDAN McCALL AND HENRY HILL (Thursday) Mr. Hill, a musician turned dancer, addresses life and love in new work on the program. Mr. McCall, a dancer, choreographer and director, looks partly to Homer's ''Odyssey'' for his inspiration. 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736 or www .dixonplace .org; $12 or T.D.F.; students and 65+, $10. (Dunning)    MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP (Sunday) Need we say more? Sunday at 3 p.m., Performing Arts Center, Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6200; $40 to $60.(Dunning)    MOVEMENT RESEARCH AT THE JUDSON CHURCH 'ABOUT TOWN' (Sunday) This free weekly winter forum offers choreographers a low-pressure context to experiment with ideas rather than present a finished work. (At least that's the theory; no doubt they get nervous anyway.) This week's lineup includes the wonderful former Merce Cunningham dancer Kimberly Bartosik, Sam Kim and Chris Yon. 8 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 598-0551.(Sulcas)    BEN MUNISTERI (Wednesday through Jan. 21) Mr. Munisteri was one of the most compelling of Doug Elkins's performers many years ago; now he makes dances that match his unpredictable, frisky stage presence. You also have to appreciate the range of his musical tastes: A new work, ''Tuesday, 4 a.m. and other dances,'' is set to Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra, while the older ''Turbine Mines'' is set to the ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack as accompaniment. 7:30 p.m. (next Friday, also at 10 p.m.), Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 9224-0077; $25; $15 for students, 65+ or artists. (Sulcas)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Today through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Peter Martins's full-length ''Swan Lake'' continues through Wednesday, with the regular mixed-repertory bills picking up again on Thursday. Tonight and tomorrow and Thursday nights at 8; tomorrow afternoon at 2; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.; New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or www.nycballet.com;$30 to $86.

Jones as well as music and text by Will Powers and direction by Jo Bonney. (Opening night is scheduled for Feb. 12.) 8 p.m., New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $60; $15 for available student tickets. (Dunning)    TROIKA RANCH (Wednesday through Saturday)) This high-technology dance and video company will perform its new ''16 [R]evolutions.'' Come early and play with the technology. 8 p.m., Eyebeam Art & Technology Center, 540 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (718) 218-6775 or www.troikaranch.org; $16; $20 (Tuesday through Thursday). (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,'  through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRaPHY: 'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from Southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. On the secular side but equally dazzling are two portraits of men from a long series of male visages done by Antonello in the 1460's and 70's. The intensely human play of expression on the subjects' faces makes a connection with the viewer that few artists before or since have been able to achieve. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Grace Glueck)    MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck)    * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Holland Cotter)    * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, (800) 944-8639. (Johnson)    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. This substantial exhibition of works on paper extends the full-scale Bluemner retrospective now at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    * SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    Galleries: Chelsea    Marina Abramovic: 'Balkan Erotic Epic' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    Douglas Anderson: 'New Old Robots' Painted in grayed colors and a brushy, cartoonish style that recalls the Ash Can School and 1930's-era Social Realism, Mr. Anderson's comical and mournful small paintings depict old shoes, plumbing, brick walls, junk cars and outmoded industrial machinery in states of dreamlike animation. Blue Mountain, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 486-4730, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    'Head Over Hand: Pushing the Limits of Paint' This well-selected and cohesive 15-artist show presents finely wrought abstract paintings that mix in most cases a hedonistic materialism and a spacey, illusory dimension. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    PHILIPPE MAZAUD: STAGE LIGHT  Roaming the countryside in rural Idaho and Nevada, Mr. Mazaud shoots provocative, sometimes spooky night scenes using only found light. Following a current tendency to make pictures that don't tell tales, but move viewers to create their own, he presents scenarios like a small house on a snowy street with two bright windows giving evidence of occupancy, illumined by a streetlight near an old-fashioned telephone pole strung with taut, crisscrossing wires. It could be the setting for domestic felicity or mayhem. Foley, 527 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Jan. 21. (Glueck)    * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Bryan Savitz The inventive Mr. Savitz presents a forest of fake tree trunks and objects, like a hammock and a pipe organ, made mainly of scratch-off lottery tickets. A wild group show in the rear gallery called ''Waiting for the Barbarians'' includes a Beaux-Arts-style pornographic vision of flying cowgirls painted by Nicola Verlato; a horribly abused anthropomorphic pig in a sculptural tableau by Fernando Mastrangelo; a large, Dalí-esque ballpoint pen drawing by Tim Maxwell; and a big, semi-abstract digital photograph by Chris Rodrigues, apparently illustrating an otherworldly epic. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 268-1520, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)    * JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212) 929-7000, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    Richard Tuttle: 'Constructed Relief Paintings' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'I woke up in a strange place ' The Postmodern mindscape gets a good workout in a show that includes Samantha Simpson's finely drawn allegorical monkeys; Simon Keenleyside's small paintings of gloomily magical birch forests; a puddle of vomit made of pearlescent pink sequins by Craig Fisher; Edward del Rosario's precise paintings of tiny, oddly dressed people; and a Neo- Pop installation representing an old world hunting-lodge interior by Ryan Humphrey. Moti Hasson, 330 West 38th Street, (212) 268-4444, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    Last Chance    Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, closing Sunday. (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * TAMY BEN-TOR, 'EXPLORATION IN THE DOMAIN OF IDIOCY' On video -- and live on Friday and Saturday afternoons -- a wonderfully talented comic performance artist creates hilariously self-absorbed characters. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, closing tomorrow.

One of the Public Theater's early Broadway transfers, this 1971 musical adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy features lyrics by John Guare and music by Galt MacDermot. Kathleen Marshall directs (2:45). The Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater, Central Park, entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West, and at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)539-8750.    'DR. SEX' Previews begin today. Opens Sept 20. After getting the Liam Neeson treatment on the big screen, the life of the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey gets its own show tunes, courtesy of this new musical comedy (2:20). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    'FRAN'S BED' Previews begin Tuesday. Opens Sept. 25. The fall season's celebrity sightings begin as James Lapine directs Mia Farrow and Julia Stiles in his play about a woman undergoing a midlife crisis (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' Opens Sept. 15. A hit at the 2004 New York Musical Theater Festival, this comic musical features trailer trash singing show tunes (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.    'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' Previews begin Wednesday. Opens Sept. 19. Rolin Jones's high-concept sci-fi play, about a young genius who builds a better robot, helps kick off the 20th anniversary season of the Atlantic Theater Company (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.    'MIRACLE BROTHERS' Opens Sept. 18. A epic new musical by Kirsten Childs about the adventures of two brothers -- one black, one white -- in 17th-century Brazil (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.    'MOTHER COURAGE' Previews begin today. Opens Sept. 4. The Jean Cocteau Repertory Theater opens its 35th season with Marc Bliztstein's world-premiere translation of Brecht's play with music. David Fuller directs (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, East Village, (212)279-4200.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Mr. Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). The Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub. Directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the show feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt, despite the presence of a top-flight cast led by Nathan Lane. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint in Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful, funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE DEAR BOY' An uptight English teacher learns to cut loose, at least a bit, when he's confronted with an unflattering portrait written by a gifted but troubled student. Capably acted but lacking in real substance (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)246-4422, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    'DEAR DUBYA: PATRIOTIC LOVE LETTERS TO WHITEHOUSE.ORG' Peevish, pathetic and plain unhinged, the e-mail messages rendered reader's-theater-style in this brief, seldom cheap, often funny show demonstrate that President Bush has no shortage of credulous, humor-impaired fans and foes (45 minutes). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)907-6189, closing Sunday. (Rob Kendt)    'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Stevens)    'IVANOV' Jonathan Bank's staging of the Chekhov classic ''Ivanov'' with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of that of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231, closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb)    'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' The hand of fate reaches all the way into a steaming hot tub filled with cranky women in this seriocomic lesbian soap opera from the Five Lesbian Brothers. A richly funny Sapphic sex comedy, it is also a serious inquiry into the unforeseen extremities of despair that can attend the search for a lasting love (1:30). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)460-5475, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap with Natasha Richardson about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)    'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)    'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the early 1970's, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)    'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    'THE CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) ''The Century of the Self,'' a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Freud's seminal theory of the subconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Dana Stevens)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-top dog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH'  (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    * 'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. (Scott)    'DEUCE BIGALOW: EUROPEAN GIGOLO' (R, 77 minutes) In a sequel to the 1999 hit, the schlubby escort lands in Amsterdam to make lovelorn ladies feel whole, but the entire ordeal is mockery disguised as self-help. The insulting comedy is out of step with the culture, the times and the rebranded Adam Sandler, who was a producer and bit-player in this mess. (Ned Martel)    'THE DUKES OF HAZZARD' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Yee-haw? Naw. (Scott)    'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael Gonzalez (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be made floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela) is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out with Steve Carell in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Stephen Holden)    'THE GOEBBELS EXPERIMENT' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English and German) Lutz Hachmeister and Michael Kloft's fascinating documentary provides a chilling glimpse into the brilliant but toxic mind of Joseph Goebbels via his extensive diaries. Careening from soggy sentimentality to maniacal extermination fantasies, the entries reveal a supremely theatrical man whose manipulation of mass political opinion was unprecedented. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie, which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)    'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry. (Dargis)    'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)    'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is in many ways less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation, and how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)    '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)    'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    'REEL PARADISE' (R, 110 minutes) Steve James's untidy but absorbing documentary follows a family of New York cinéastes to Fiji, where they show free movies to the people, and experience mild culture clash and domestic disharmony. (Holden)    *'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) This is a relentless assault on the senses about three hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul ), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Laura Kern)    'THE SKELETON KEY' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Kate Hudson in a T-shirt and underwear, intimations of unspeakable evil, slamming doors and equally slamming edits and an introductory course in hoodoo, a folk religion born in the South -- all this and Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and John Hurt, too. (Dargis)    'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)    'SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE' (No rating, 121 minutes) In this exploitation flick from Park Chanwook about two men who each set a course for bloody vengeance, the violence carries no meaning beyond the director's ego. (Dargis)    'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) A delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, it is about a lonely man who at 37 awakens to life for the first time during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)    '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL' (No rating, 70 minutes) Keith A. Beauchamp's lean, harrowing documentary about the 50-year-old murder that catalyzed the civil rights movement offers new evidence that the crime was a broader conspiracy than originally thought. (Holden)    'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in this movie's cartoon voiceovers. (Holden)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    THE BEST OF NEWFEST 2005 (Through Sunday) BAM cinématek presents a weekend festival of nine feature films and three shorts programs from the recent 17th annual New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Film Festival.

(Through Tuesday) This summer festival, presented by Thalia Film Classics, honors great women in classic movies, this week with two intense femmes fatales.

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    AMERICAN ANALOG SET (Tuesday) This Austin band plays wistful, conspiratorial whisper-pop that's more hum than drone. Playing in the cocoonlike Joe's Pub should make this stop on the band's farewell tour especially intimate. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $15. (Laura Sinagra)    KEYSHIA COLE (Wednesday) The Oakland-born R&B singer Keyshia Cole presents a tough-cookie brand of diva soul that focuses less on fashionista posing than righteous recrimination. On her single ''I Changed My Mind,'' she rides Kanye West's hard-clapping track with sultry grit. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20 in advance, $22. (Sinagra)    ALICE COOPER, CHEAP TRICK (Monday) School's been out forever, but the snake-toting father of glammy, hard-rock horror, Alice Cooper, still manages to growl out adolescent complaints like ''Eighteen'' and ''No More Mr. Nice Guy.'' Seminal 70's power-popper Cheap Trick, still in fine form, enjoys regular praise from younger bands both pop-punk and emo. 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $43. (Sinagra)    DEAD BOYS, FLIPPER (Tonight and tomorrow) Their history bound with CBGB's, the living members of Cleveland's Dead Boys, whose ''Sonic Reducer'' is a punk epic, reconvene to play a benefit for their former manager Hilly Kristal's imperiled club. Tonight with San Francisco's ooze-punk band Flipper, known for the hard-core sludge howler ''Sex Bomb.'' Tomorrow, with the dirty Anti-Nowhere League, the Nihilistics, and SFA, 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $35.

(Sinagra)    GREEN DAY (Thursday) Since the mid-90's, these pop-punkers have moved from couch-surfing anthems to smackdowns of exurban cluelessness. The trio's ''American Idiot'' (Reprise, 2004) rejected both a ''redneck agenda'' and sleepwalking worship of the ''Jesus of Suburbia.'' 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., Ticketmaster.com, $35. (Sinagra)    DARYL HALL & JOHN OATES, TODD RUNDGREN (Tonight and Tuesday) The Philadelphia platinum pop duo has always relied on the blue-eyed-soul crooner Daryl Hall's ability to emote within tight, rhythmic constraints while John Oates harmonizes urgently above. Mr. Hall has recently been fighting Lyme disease but is reportedly still in fine voice. The 70's pop powerhouse Todd Rundgren is a perfect addition to the bill. Tonight at 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $50. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $50. (Sinagra)    COREY HARRIS, HUBERT SUMLIN (Sunday) Mr. Harris is a traditionalist fingerpicker who finds new insights in classic country blues. Playing lead guitar behind Howlin' Wolf for more than two decades, Mr. Sumlin defined the jagged, asymmetrical attack of classic Chicago blues guitar. His spiky aggression echoes through blues and rock. These two artists are highlights of a Sunday-afternoon blues and barbecue bill that includes Guitar Shorty and Candye Kane. Mr. Harris plays at 3:45 p.m., Mr. Sumlin at 7:45. Festival runs from 2 to 9 p.m., Hudson River Park, Pier 54, (212)627-2020, free.

(Sinagra)    ICE-T, KOOL KEITH & THE ULTRAMAGNETIC MC'S (Tuesday) The Los Angeles rapper Ice-T's styles have run the gamut from dance-floor pimping to the rap-metal squall of his band Body Count. The shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith's Ultramagnetic MC's were a critical hit in rap's late-80's golden age, helping to nudge old school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. Solo, he created personae like Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom, though his intricate, zany, rhymes have grown less rewarding over time. Ice-T and Kool Keith have recorded together in the past as the Analog Brothers. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $18 to $20.

(Sinagra)    JOURNEY (Tonight and Sunday) Despite the absence of Steve Perry's soaring vocals, the 80's pop band responsible for anthemic keyboard-driven schmaltz like ''Don't Stop Believin''' and ''Faithfully'' soldiers on for crowds singing along way too loud to notice. Tonight at 8, PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $63. Sunday at 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $65.

(Sinagra)    AVRIL LAVIGNE, GAVIN DEGRAW (Tomorrow) The pop skater-girl Avril Lavigne is keeping her surf cred by hanging tight with Sum 41's singer, Deryck Whibley. But she's maturing into a tough-minded careerist, teaming up here with an opening act sure not to overshadow her, the likable pianist Gavin DeGraw. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $46. (Sinagra)    TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS, I AM KLOOT (Tomorrow) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and falsetto also recall the 70's arena rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. The Manchester indie-poppers I Am Kloot open. 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17 (Fulton Street), Lower Manhattan, (212)219-3910, free. (Sinagra)    LOUIS XIV, THE IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Thursday) The lads in the exaggerated glam outfit Louis XIV are sloppier and rockier than the Darkness and significantly less sincere. To paraphrase their hero T-Rex, they think they're champs, but they're not. The Minnesota bar rocker Ike Reilly is more clever and slightly less suspect. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $15. (Sinagra)    THE NEVILLE BROTHERS (Tonight) The Neville Brothers have been at the center of New Orleans funk since the 1950's, and apply all their experience in syncopation to their own songs and, lately, cover songs like ''Ball of Confusion.'' 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, $33 in advance, $35. (Pareles)    RAINER MARIA (Monday) This Midwestern emo band's best asset is the bassist Caithlin De Marrais, who screams eloquent diary entries over pointy, distorted guitar pop. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $10.

It gained some fame a few years back when its hard-partying singer dated Kelly Osbourne. 5:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212)485-1534, $30. (Sinagra)    CARLOS VIVES, DADDY YANKEE (Tomorrow) The Colombian singer-songwriter Carlos Vives made his name weaving Bogotá balladry, Andean traditional music and accordion-heavy coastal vallenato into rock and pop.

(Kozinn)    MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA (Tonight and tomorrow) The Russian composer Dmitry Stepanovich Bortnyansky, born five years before Mozart, was a Mozart devotee who presented Mozart's Requiem and other Mozart works at the Russian imperial court. In his own music he emulated Mozartean qualities of clarity and elegance. The connection between the two composers, however thematically tenuous, was enough to prompt Louis Langrée, the music director of the Mostly Mozart Festival, to pair Bortnyansky's little-known ''Te Deum'' on tonight's program with Mozart's Mass in C minor for the final weekend of the festival. The singers of the Russian Patriarchate Choir, an all-male ensemble that specializes in Russian liturgical chant and 19th-century Russian choral works, will perform, along with the Concert Chorale of New York and a roster of strong vocal soloists. Tomorrow night the festival concludes with a far more traditional all-Mozart program. The Mass in C minor will be repeated, this time preceded by the Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, with the pianist Jonathan Biss as soloist. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $32 to $52. (Anthony Tommasini)    MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Offering a smattering of choral music and jazz but focusing on string quartets, this venerable festival presents the Bard Festival String Quartet this weekend in an all-Beethoven program with one quartet from each of the composer's so-called three periods, from Op. 18, No. 4 (C minor) to Op. 127 (E-flat major). Also on offer this weekend is Cynthia Sayer's Hot Jazz Trio, featuring a banjoist with a focus on music of the 1920's and 30's. Tomorrow night at 8 (jazz), Sunday afternoon at 3 (pre-concert event, ''The Little Guild of St. Francis,'' at 2), Gordon Hall at Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860)824-7126, $25, $12 for students under 24. (Midgette)    SKANEATELES FESTIVAL (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Since most other festivals are beginning to fold their tents, it may be time to dig out the map and do some exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, N.Y., near Syracuse, this event presents an attractive chamber concert tonight and a concert by the Festival Chamber Orchestra, including wonderful wind serenades by Mozart and Dvorak, tomorrow. The excellent violinist Hilary Hahn appears in a free children's concert on Wednesday morning at 11 and in another chamber concert on Thursday. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 8; tonight and Wednesday at First Presbyterian Church, 97 East Genesee Street; tomorrow at Brook Farm, south on Route 41A; Thursday at Skaneateles High School, 49 East Elizabeth Street, (315)685-7418; tonight and Thursday, $16 and $21, $13 and $18 for students and 65+; tomorrow, $18 and $24. (James R. Oestreich)    TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) The Polish conductor Marek Janowski comes to the Berkshires to conclude the Boston Symphony Orchestra's Tanglewood season. He'll have help tonight from Lynn Harrell, who will be the soloist in Haydn's Cello Concerto No. 2 on a program that also includes Beethoven's Second Symphony and Mozart's Serenade No. 6 (K. 239). On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Janowski leads Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Tanglewood Festival Chorus joined by Hillevi Martinpelto, soprano; Susan Platts, mezzo-soprano; Kurt Streit, tenor; and Alastair Miles, bass-baritone. But the weekend is not all somber goodbyes. Tomorrow night, John Williams leads the Boston Pops, along with Josh Groban, in ''Film Night at Tanglewood.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200, $17 (lawn) to $96. (Eichler)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    HOWL FESTIVAL 2005: YOSHIKO CHUMA & THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS (Tonight through Sunday) In her new ''Inside/Outside,'' this madcap modern-dance choreographer creates a world of stage space and cubes, with black-and-white film projected on them. The program also includes ''8 Brand New Short Dances,'' a suite of pieces created by newish downtown choreographers and shown two per show. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 5 p.m. P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue at Ninth Street, East Village; (212)477-5288 or www.ps122.org, $15. (Jennifer Dunning)    JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) This is the last weekend of this charming and important Berkshires dancefest. Tonight through Sunday, Black Grace from New Zealand, a big hit last summer, will be at the larger Ted Shawn Theater, and Project Fukurow, offering mysterious weirdness from Tokyo, will be at the Doris Duke Studio Theater. Black Grace, tonight and tomorrow night at 8, and Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m.; $45; $40.50 for students, 65+ and children. Fukurow, tonight and tomorrow night at 8:15, Saturday at 2:15 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m.; $20; $18 for students, seniors and children. Details of free performances and exhibitions can be found at www.jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413)243-0745. (John Rockwell)    LINCOLN CENTER OUT OF DOORS FESTIVAL (Monday through Thursday) Jamel Gaines and his Creative Outlet Dance Theater of Brooklyn will tear up the plaza at 6 p.m. today, followed by the José Limón Dance Company tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the Damrosch Park Band Shell, in a program that includes Limón's ''Moor's Pavane'' and ''Chaconne,'' and dances by Jiri Kylian, Lar Lubovitch and Donald McKayle. In the closing week of this free festival, there will also be performances by the Hung-Sheng Lion Dance Theater (Monday at 8 p.m. in the band shell and Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. in the plaza); the hip-hopping FLY Dance Company (Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. in the plaza); KanKouran West African Dance Company of Washington (Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the band shell); and Celebrando méxicoNOW (Thursday at 8 p.m. in the band shell). (212)875-5766 and www.lincolncenter.org. (Dunning)    NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL FRINGE FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) In the closing week of this sprawling, provocative festival of new art, there will be dance performances by Anandam of ''Frida and Herself,'' a piece by Brandy Leary and Prashant Gupta that is drawn from the life and work of Frida Kahlo (today at 3:15 p.m.; tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; and Sunday at noon). The Tickly Cheeks Group will present ''Rock Out.'' Created by Gregory Jones and Tiffany Hodges, ''Rock Out'' tells the story of two shy types whose inner selves are released by dancing (tonight at 11; tomorrow at 1 p.m. and Sunday at 1:45 p.m.) All performances are at the Linhart Theater, 440 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)279-4488; (888)374-6436 (outside New York) and www.fringenyc.org, $15. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,'  through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent, and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,'  through Sept. 4. Sifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES,' through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair to good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to an organization called Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    THE NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or his weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Oct. 9. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 31. Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: Uptown    'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook where he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)    IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    'REPEAT PERFORMANCE'  More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'BODY AND OBJECTS' Depending on your mood, this three-person show might provoke thought or irritation. Most striking are Jiang Zhi's large photographs of two topless dancers, one a woman who has had a double mastectomy, the other a transsexual with breast implants. Tang Yi presents a series of photographs of a young woman blowing up colored balloons into a birdcage, and Chu Yun offers worn bars of soap as miniature sculptures formed by contact with his body. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)414-1169, through Sept. 2. (Johnson)    WILLIAM EGGLESTON 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Sept. 2 (Johnson)    JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)    'ON VIEW: PHOTOGRAPHING THE MUSEUM' Among 20 well-selected ways of picturing the museum are Elliot Erwitt's view of a naked, sculptural Diana aiming her arrow at an unsuspecting live male visitor; wax figures by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Diane Arbus; a specimen drawer full of cardinals (birds, that is) by Terry Evans; and the dreamlike image of three real foxes in a formal period room by Karen Knorr. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20- inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)    'SELF-PRESERVATION SOCIETY' A longtime holdout finally moves to Chelsea and opens a sleek space with a lively show of gallery regulars. Basketball fans must see Tom Sanford's comic-realist painting of last season's infamous brawl between the Pacers and the Pistons. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, (212)334-9255, through Sept. 3. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures depicted naturalistically, real animals portrayed surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)    'EXILE, NEW YORK IS A GOOD HOTEL,'  This new gallery, established by the German-based critic and curator Anke Kempkes, offers a spectacular view of the Empire State Building and an international introductory show of work by young artists from Berlin, Glasgow and Warsaw, along with a collaborative slide piece by the New Yorkers Ken Okiishi and Nick Mauss. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, near 28th Street, Apt. 1602, (212)481-0362, through Sept. 17. (Cotter)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10, by appointment. (Johnson)    'ARTISTS AND PATRONS IN TRADITIONAL AFRICAN CULTURES: AFRICAN SCULPTURE FROM THE GARY SCHULZE COLLECTION'  Queensborough Community College has quietly assembled an impressive collection of African art. A year ago, the college inaugurated a permanent display of the collection in its campus gallery. And this summer the gallery is presenting a temporary exhibition of nearly 100 sculptures from a private collection. Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, the City University of New York, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, Queens, (718)631-6396. through Sept. 30. (Cotter)    'A.B. NORMAL'  Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyper-realistic Zamboni made of rigid pale-green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    'PRECIOUS MOMENTS' Mall culture, with its peculiar poignancies, is the theme of ''Precious Moments,'' a smart, sad five-person show organized by the artist Josh Kline. Joymore, 236 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (646)270-0376, through Sept. 10. (Cotter)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft-drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, closing Sunday. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS' This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    LIU ZHENG: 'THE CHINESE' Under the influence of Sander, Frank and Arbus, this Chinese photographer set out to document his society with a focus on the dark and wild side. His pictures of miners, prisoners, strippers, transsexuals, hospital patients and corpses have an almost surrealistic intensity. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)414-0370, closing today. (Johnson)    'MASTERS OF CONTEMPORARY SCULPTURE' If you disregard the ugly and pretentious installation piece by the dean of Arte Povera, Mario Merz, then 50 glass snowballs by Not Vital, a circle of granite chunks by Richard Long, a sculptureof stairs painted in Burmese red lacquer by Wolfgang Laib, a life-size simulation of an airplane lavatory by Tom Sachs and a 51-minute piece of Bruce Nauman's nocturnal video of his studio all add up to an almost perfectly satisfying show. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, (212)999-7337, closing on Wednesday. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400, closing Monday. (Kimmelman)    'REMARKABLE HANDS' Three Japanese make art by hand: Yayoi Deki creates gently psychedelic floral patterns with a finely pointed brush; Yoko Kawamoto paints small, photo-based pictures of junked cars and industrial sites with a dry but sensuous touch; and Tomoo Gokita, using chameleonlike skill and mischievous humor, draws many different kinds of pop-culture imagery. ATM, 511 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)375-0349, closing today.
