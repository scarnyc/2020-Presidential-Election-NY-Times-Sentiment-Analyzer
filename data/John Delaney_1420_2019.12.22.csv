Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'KIKI AND HERB: ALIVE ON BROADWAY' This transcendental lounge act -- made up of Kiki (Justin Bond), a molting songbird for all seasons, and Herb (Kenny Mellman), her happily suffering shadow and accompanist -- has the heat and dazzle of great balls of fire. Vital, funny and surprisingly affecting (2:00). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'CREATION: A CLOWN SHOW' Lucas Caleb Rooney is a cross between Red Skelton and Will Ferrell in this sweet, funny, poignant mostly one-man show about the biblical story of earth's first seven days (1:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)    'EVERYTHINgS TURNING INTO BEAUTIFUL' Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's thrill-free demi-musical about a pair of commitment-wary songwriters (Daphne Rubin-Vega and Malik Yoba) is clearly intended to progress from wintry loneliness to heated confrontation and eroticism. But it remains stolidly at room temperature. Directed by Carl Forsman, with songs by Jimmie James (1:50). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)    'INDIAN BLOOD' As slight as it is sweet, A. R. Gurney's latest is like a snow globe for the stage, in this case a memento of wintry Buffalo in the mid-1940's. Written with delicacy and old-school craftsmanship, the work is a modest memory play endowed with a measure of emotional heft by its unchallenged but unusually strong cast, which includes John McMartin and Rebecca Luker (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' If you ever wanted to watch one willowy human being lift a 12-ton play onto her shoulders and hold it there for hours, even as her muscles buckle, join the line to see Meryl Streep burning energy like a supernova in this otherwise less-than-stunning production. Directed by George C. Wolfe, from a new translation by Tony Kushner (2:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park, (212) 539-8750; free. (Brantley)    'MR. DOOLEY'S AMERICA' Martin J. Dooley, the wisest fictional pub owner in 1890's Chicago, brings his old newspaper columns back to life with funny, surprisingly timely issues-of-the-day commentary in this likable two-man play (1:40). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'SHOUT!' A mini-skirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival Cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'HENRIK IBSEN + JON FOSSE: NORWAY MEETS NEW YORK' Ibsen's late-19th-century ''Rosmersholm'' and Fosse's contemporary ''deathvariations'' both deal with suicide, among other life dramas. The Ibsen has problems, but the Fosse is often stunning and fiercely poetic (2:00 and 1:15). At the 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)    Spectacles    'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims at a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)    'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 307-4100. ( Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ANAIS NIN: ONE OF HER LIVES' Angela Christian is superb as Nin in this uneven but largely rewarding production about her affair with Henry Miller and his wife, June, in Paris in the 1930's (1:30). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16; closing tomorrow. (Hunka)    'THE DISPUTE' Marivaux's 1744 comedy about sex roles is like a sci-fi romance and, in the hands of the National Asian American Theater Company, an enchanting piece of theater (1:10). The Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'EVENSONG' Mary Gage's rewarding six-character play is a reflection on the diversity of human experience and a reminder never to define the elderly by their age (1:35). TBG Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'A STONE CARVER' Despite the high cliché factor, William Mastrosimone's play about an Italian immigrant who is losing his house to a highway exit is timely and sporadically touching, largely because of Dan Lauria's over-the-top performance as the title character and old-world patriarch who makes a mean barrel of wine and never talks when he can shout (1:40). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee)    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott)    'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)    'The Beales of Grey Gardens' (No rating, 90 minutes) The Maysles brothers dig into their archives for this collection of outtakes from ''Grey Gardens,'' their 1975 cinema vérité classic about the most fascinating cat ladies in the Hamptons. Essential viewing for drag queens. (Lee)    'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    * 'THE BRIDESMAID' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) The great Claude Chabrol again takes up a sharp instrument and directs it at one of his favorite targets, the family. Yet while his aim remains true, his touch has become gentler, more forgiving. (Dargis) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt- putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    'The Celestine Prophecy' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis)    * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)    'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    'CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN' (No rating, 84 minutes) Two old flames meet, years after parting, and have a short fling. An arch, banal conceit, of some interest for Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter's performances and the split-screen gimmick that keeps them apart even in their intimate moments. (Scott)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    * 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)    'FRATRICIDE' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Kurdish, German and Turkish) The familiar story of the innocent soul who travels from the country to the big, bad city receives a thorough workout from the Turkish-born German-transplant Yilmaz Arslan. If the human disembowelment via a pit bull doesn't bum you out, the child rape should do the trick. (Dargis)    * 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haut-bourgeois Parisian marriage, around 1912. (Dargis)    'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden)    * 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)    * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    * 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott)    * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)    'KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST' (No rating, 108 minutes) An overloaded, visually chaotic, well-meaning documentary about King Leopold of Belgium's genocidal adventures in the Congo, directed by Pippa Scott from the Adam Hochschild best seller. (Dargis)    'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)    'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)    * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)    'MATERIAL GIRLS' (PG, 97 minutes) The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story from, alas, Martha Coolidge. (Dargis)    * 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)    * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)    'MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Arabic, English and Kurdish) Filmed in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2005, ''My Country, My Country'' views the prelude to the January elections primarily through the eyes of Dr. Riyadh, a Sunni candidate and physician who runs a free clinic in Baghdad. Without comment but with unusual sensitivity, the director, Laura Poitras, exposes the emotional toll of occupation on Iraqis and United States soldiers alike, leaving us feeling that this particular mission is far from accomplished. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'THE NIGHT LISTENER' (R, 82 minutes) Robin Williams plays a writer and radio host who strikes up a long-distance friendship with a young man who may not exist. An intriguing premise, but not satisfyingly realized. (Scott)    'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)    'POSTER BOY' (R, 98 minutes) A polemic masquerading as a movie, ''Poster Boy'' follows the closeted gay son (Matt Newton) of a Jesse Helms-style senator (Michael Lerner) as he gears up for a major act of filial rebellion. Directed by Zak Tucker with more sincerity than skill, ''Poster Boy'' is a plodding indictment of extreme conservative intolerance. But it's difficult to feel sorry for its hero when he's having so much fun feeling sorry for himself. (Catsoulis)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'Pulse' (PG-13, 87 minutes) Evil technology menaces idiotic teenagers in this cynical remake of a Japanese horror film. (Lee)    'THE PUSHER TRILOGY' (No rating, 105 minutes, 96 minutes and 102 minutes, in Danish) Life and death on the mean streets of Copenhagen -- they evidently exist -- are rendered with pungent detail and excellent discipline in this tough trio of underworld thrillers. (Lee)    * 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)    'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark 13-letter epithet. (Dargis)    'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott)    '10TH AND WOLF' (R, 110 minutes) A grisly gangster movie with moral pretensions, ''10th and Wolf'' never transcends mobster clichés recycled from ''The Godfather,'' ''Donnie Brasco'' and ''GoodFellas.'' (Holden)    '13 Tzameti'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)    'TRUST THE MAN' (R, 101 minutes) A strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, from the writer and director Bart Freundlich. With Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Billy Crudup. (Dargis)    * 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    'You, Me and Dupree' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)    Film Series    THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS (Through Sept. 25) Film Forum's eight-film, eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) continues on Monday night with ''Steamboat Bill Jr.'' (1925), about the prissy son of a manly riverboat captain. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates)    KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Throne of Blood'' (1955), the ''Macbeth'' story set in medieval Japan. Toshiro Mifune stars, of course. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates)    THE LEADING MEN OF FRENCH CINEMA (Through Sunday) BAMcinématek's tribute to 17 French actors ends this weekend with three films. Patrick Dewaere plays a self-destructive suburban salesman in ''Série Noire'' (1979). Gérard Depardieu is a cad having an affair with Isabelle Huppert's upper-middle-class character in ''Loulou'' (1980). And Jean-Pierre Léaud stars in ''The Mother and the Whore'' (1973), a drama about the games people play and call sexual liberation. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    THE HUSTON FAMILY: 75 YEARS ON FILM (Through Sept. 22) The Museum of Modern Art's 40-film tribute to the Hustons and their intertwined careers continues with eight films this weekend. They include ''A Walk With Love and Death'' (1969), Anjelica's screen debut; the Tennessee Williams drama ''The Night of the Iguana'' (1964), directed and adapted by John; and ''The Shanghai Gesture'' (1941), a noir melodrama starring Walter. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    MARY PICKFORD RESTORED (Through Sept. 3) The Museum of the Moving Image honors Hollywood's first real movie star with restored 35-millimeter prints of some of her silent films. The series begins tomorrow with ''Behind the Scenes'' (1914), about a movie star who marries a farmer, and ''The Little American'' (1917), a World War I story directed by Cecil B. DeMille. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * BEIRUT (Tonight) Beirut is the project of Zach Condon, a 20-year-old Albuquerque native who recently released ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), an album of somber and ecstatic Balkan Gypsy marches, recording most of the horns, pianos, organs, percussion and even ukulele and mandolins himself. In just a few months, thanks to some high-energy shows, it has become the toast of the indie-rock intelligentsia. With Get Him Eat Him, the Harlem Shakes and Curtains. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario)    CHARLES BISSELL (Tuesday) In the Wrens, a New Jersey band of late-1980's vintage that is known as much for its struggles in making records as for its wonderful music, Mr. Bissell sings about exhaustion, day jobs and failed dreams with an intensity seldom matched by rockers half his age. While fans wait for a new album -- they are used to waiting -- Mr. Bissell is in residence on Tuesday nights in the small Tap Bar, downstairs at the Knitting Factory. With Roman Kuebler and John Ralston. At 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $8. (Sisario)    BLACK EYED PEAS, PUSSYCAT DOLLS (Tonight and Tuesday) These two pop monsters are at the top of their game, churning out hit after hit of sexy, hip-hop-flavored bubble gum. But enough about music; which will be dressed better? Tonight at 7, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $29.50 to $59.50. Tuesday at 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $25 to $59.50. (Sisario)    BRAIN SURGEONS NYC (Tonight) The current wave of retro-metal ironists have nothing on Albert Bouchard, who in Blue Oyster Cult expertly navigated the boundary between earnestness and parody. His latest project is Brain Surgeons NYC, which includes Ross the Boss of the Dictators and Manowar on guitar. With the Marc Shulman Blues Band. At 9, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12. (Sisario)    DAVID BROMBERG AND THE ANGEL BAND (Thursday) Mr. Bromberg can play just about anything with strings -- guitar, dobro, mandolin, fiddle -- and his knowledge of American music spans blues, bluegrass, country and rock. He also has a gift for elaborate verbal riffs that turn his long-suffering blues into comedy. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    * CHRIS BROWN, NE-YO, LIL WAYNE, DEM FRANCHIZE BOYZ, JUELZ SANTANA, CHERISH (Tomorrow) Looking for proof that girls rule? This sure-to-be-riotous concert brings together a night full of male performers (plus the four sisters of Cherish), for the delectation of a few thousand screaming female fans. Mr. Brown and Cherish will dance, Ne-Yo will croon, the others will rap, all of them blurring the fine line that separates the entertainment industry from the service industry. At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $29.50 to $89.50. (Kelefa Sanneh)    * MARIAH CAREY (Sunday) Before there was ''Idol'' there was Mariah, who made octave-hopping melisma a sport and never met a song she couldn't ride to No. 1. Young singers afraid of being a flash in the pan could learn a lot from Ms. Carey's recent comeback, which relied on fresh hip-hop producers and songwriters. With Sean Paul. At 8 p.m. Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $19.50 to $152. (Sisario)    CROSBY, STILLS, NASH AND YOUNG (Sunday) It's the fourth partner, Neil Young, who just might push this alliance beyond self-satisfied baby-boom nostalgia and vocal harmonies into something like rock. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $255.50 tickets remaining. (Pareles)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity, and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133, dannysgrandseapalace.com; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Stephen Holden)    BOB DYLAN (Tuesday) It might not make sense that Bob Dylan is playing at minor-league baseball stadiums this summer, but his devotion is on record: this is the third year he has done the tour, and a baseball-theme episode of his XM Satellite Radio show -- in which the singer of ''Masters of War'' and ''Like a Rolling Stone'' does an a cappella ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' -- has been added to the archive of the National Baseball Hall of Fame Library. With Jimmie Vaughan, Junior Brown, Elana James and the Continental Two. At 6:30 p.m., New Britain Stadium, New Britain, Conn., (860) 224-8383 or (860) 525-4500, concertstonight.com; $49.50; one child under 12 will be admitted free with each ticket holder. (Sisario)    FINAL FANTASY (Thursday) Owen Pallett, who wrote the stirring string arrangements for the Arcade Fire's album ''Funeral,'' creates nervous universes in miniature as Final Fantasy, looping ribbons of violin around his quavering voice. He named his project after a video game, which he has described in terms that suit the music as well: ''ridiculously overwrought and convoluted emotionally.'' With Bob Wiseman and Arbor Day. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)    DIAMANDA GALÁS (Thursday) Though she is invariably dressed in black, with her face in witchy streaks of makeup, Ms. Galás needs only her voice to terrify, seduce and beguile. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. In the last of four shows at the Spiegeltent downtown, she offers a multicultural history lesson in outsiders' songs, from the rebetika of the Greek underworld to works of the French poètes maudits; her voice should particularly shine in her performance of the wailing, improvisatory funeral lamentations known as amanethes. At 6 p.m., the former Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Sisario)    * TED LEO/PHARMACISTS (Tonight) The South Street Seaport concert each year by Mr. Leo -- as talented a songwriter as there is in the punk-pop world -- has become an obstinate rite of summer in New York. For the last four years the elements have conspired to shut him down, but each time, despite heavy rains and even, in 2003, the biggest blackout in American history, the show has triumphantly gone on. With DC Snipers and Tokyo Police Club. At 6, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, seaportmusicfestival.com; free. (Sisario)    MAGIC NUMBERS (Wednesday) Perfectly jangly bubble-gum harmonies of mid-1960's vintage get a slight melancholy twist with this British foursome, made up of brother-and-sister pairs. At 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario)    JOHN MAYER/SHERYL CROW (Sunday and Wednesday) Along with his songwriting chops, the sloe-eyed singer and guitarist John Mayer brings to the folk-rock sphere a winsome combination of earnest, sexy questing and easygoing humor. With her girlish voice and her sunny, straightforward tunes, Sheryl Crow keeps her perspective on all the disappointments and troubled romances she sings about. Sunday at 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; Wednesday at 7 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $30.50 to $76. (Pareles)    OLIVER MTUKUDZI (Thursday) Like too many African stars, this Zimbabwean singer and nimble guitarist is often presented as a purveyor of ''words of wisdom,'' to quote the liner notes to his last album, ''Nhava'' (Heads Up). Luckily, his music isn't nearly so heavy-handed: expect a gorgeous night of gentle but restless polyrhythmic grooves. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sanneh)    RANCID (Tonight through Sunday) This long-running group of studious Clash revivalists announced two years ago that it was going on hiatus, but that didn't last long. Rancid is said to be working on a new album and plays the last three shows of a four-night engagement at B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, promising that no two nights on its tour will be the same. At 8 p.m., with Theo and the Skyscrapers (tonight); Big D and the Kids Table, and the Lordz (tomorrow); and Danny Diablo and the Slanderin (Sunday). 243 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; sold out. (Sisario)    SMOKING POPES (Tonight) This Chicago band played some of the smartest and most tuneful power-pop of the 90's; one album reached back to Patsy Cline and Rodgers and Hart. The group broke up in 1998 after a familiar record-company drama, but has been touring occasionally since its reunion last year. With Criteria and the Picture. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario)    UNCLE MONK (Tonight and tomorrow) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this acoustic duo, singing tautly written numbers -- much like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. Tonight at 8, with Andy Mullen, John Arthur Martinez and the Flanks; Ace of Clubs, 9 Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 677-6924, aceofclubsnyc.com; $8. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., with the M Shanghai String Band and Hogzilla, Freddy's Back Room, 485 Dean Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 622-7035, freddysbackroom.com; no cover. (Sisario)    WALKMEN, DR. DOG, HUMAN TELEVISION, ELVIS PERKINS (Sunday) There's a varied lineup at this weekend's pool party at McCarren Park. The Walkmen play exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. Dr. Dog, from Philadelphia, takes a jam-band approach to high-energy rhapsodies that recall ''Abbey Road''-era Beatles. Human Television, also from Philadelphia, and Elvis Perkins, from Rhode Island, specialize in tuneful low-fi pop. At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn; thepoolparties.com; free. (Sisario)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    GERI ALLEN TRIO (Tonight through Sunday) ''Timeless Portraits and Dreams'' (Telarc), a soulfully earnest new album by the pianist Geri Allen, includes a number of different instrumental settings, including one with a vocal chorus. Ms. Allen is appearing in a basic but eminently rewarding lineup, with her longtime associate Darryl Hall on bass and the venerable Jimmy Cobb on drums. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25 tonight and tomorrow, $20 Sunday, with a $10 minimum.

At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    RICHIE BEIRACH TRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) Richie Beirach is an introspective pianist with a style often suggestive of Bill Evans. He has worked closely not only with the bassist George Mraz and the drummer Billy Hart, who form his rhythm section here, but also with the violinist Gregor Huebner, who joins as a special guest. Through Sept. 2 at 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    LARRY CORYELL, VICTOR BAILEY AND LENNY WHITE (Tuesday and Wednesday) This all-star fusion trio's forthcoming second album, ''Traffic'' (Chesky), adheres to a potent formula: equal parts electric guitar heroism, courtesy of Mr. Coryell; electric bass acrobatics, via Mr. Bailey; and percussive intensity, from Mr. White. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    AL FOSTER QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Al Foster's drumming is often a fluttering proposition, but he has also proved his authority with hard-driving funk. His quartet consists of smart younger players: the saxophonist Eli Degibri, the pianist Kevin Hays and the bassist Doug Weiss. Through Sept. 3. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    EDDIE GOMEZ AND MARK KRAMER WITH GENE JACKSON (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Gomez, a proficient bassist, and Mr. Kramer, an understated pianist, recently released an album tellingly titled ''Art of the Heart'' (Art of Life). They are reprising their songbook romanticism here, adding the welcome kick of Mr. Jackson on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow. Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    WINARD HARPER SEXTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Harper is an appealingly scrappy drummer, and he has a new album, ''Make It Happen'' (Piadrum), which infuses hard bop with elements of African and Caribbean rhythm. As on the album, he works here with a front line of Josh Evans on trumpet and Stacy Dillard on tenor saxophone. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)    ROY HAYNES FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH BAND (Tonight through Sunday) The redoubtable drummer Roy Haynes is an octogenarian, though you'd never guess it by the freshness and ferocity of his playing. His working quartet features musicians many years his junior: the alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, the pianist Martin Bejerano and the bassist David Wong. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    OLIVER LAKE ORGAN TRIO WITH DJ JAHI SUNDANCE (Tomorrow) Mr. Lake is an alto saxophonist with a piercing sound and an adventurous style. Those traits should come in handy on this engagement with Jared Gold on Hammond B-3 organ, Chris Dave on drums and Jahi Sundance on turntables. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    TANIA MARIA (Tonight through Sunday) On her album ''Intimidade,'' recently released on Blue Note, Tania Maria applies her conversational vocals and piano playing to a brand of acoustic pop well seasoned by the sound of her native Brazil. She enacts the same fusion here, with a group consisting of the bassist Sergio Brandao and the percussionists Rick Sebastian and Mestre Carneiro. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    FRANK MORGAN AND RONNIE MATTHEWS (Tonight) Now in his 70's, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan is one of the last survivors of the bebop era (and in his case, ''survivor'' is truly the appropriate term). Performing in duo with the pianist Ronnie Mathews, he celebrates the release of his latest album, the second one, with the title ''Reflections'' (HighNote). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    * CHARLIE PARKER JAZZ FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) Now in its 14th season, and its fourth under the aegis of the City Parks Foundation, the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival honors its namesake with a pair of free outdoor concerts. Tomorrow's show, in Harlem, consists of ensembles led by the drummer Chico Hamilton and the saxophonists George Coleman, Sonny Fortune and Greg Osby. Sunday's concert is in the East Village; along with Mr. Hamilton, it features the saxophonist David Sánchez, the pianist Joanne Brackeen and the percussionist Ray Mantilla. Tomorrow at 3 p.m. at Marcus Garvey Park, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, from 120th to 124th Streets, Harlem; Sunday at 3 p.m. at Tompkins Square Park, between Avenues A and B, from 7th Street to 10th Street, East Village, summerstage.org; free. (Chinen)    OSCAR PETERSON QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday) At 81, Oscar Peterson still plays the piano with a buoyant sense of swing, though considerably less virtuosity than in his popular prime. He plays few club engagements these days, but when he does he usually has a solid band like this one, with Ulf Wakenius on guitar, David Young on bass and Alvin Queen on drums. At 8 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $75, $100 for the first two rows, with a $10 minimum. All shows are sold out. (Chinen)    PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Thursday) ''Waits and Measures'' (Playscape), a new album by the alto saxophonist Pete Robbins, is an intimate jazz-rock hybrid complete with Fender Rhodes piano and artfully fuzzed-out electric guitar. Mr. Robbins will mark the album's release with the saxophonist Sam Sadigursky, the guitarists Mike Gamble and Ryan Blotnick, the keyboardist Eliot Cardinaux, the bassist Rob Jost and the drummer Take Toriyama. At 9 and 10 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; no cover. (Chinen)    ADAM ROGERS QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Adam Rogers is a guitarist whose most recent album, ''Apparitions'' (Criss Cross), features serpentine melodic lines and a rock-informed rhythmic thrust. Among the musicians pursuing a similar sound here are Chris Potter on saxophones, Scott Colley on bass and Clarence Penn on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15. (Chinen)    * SONNY ROLLINS (Sunday) This free Lincoln Center Out of Doors concert by the tenor saxophone giant Sonny Rollins has become a cherished ritual for jazz fans, and for good reason. It's often Mr. Rollins's only New York City appearance all year, and he always packs it with his trademarks: lengthy, exploratory solos; songbook obscurities and not-quite-standards; and at least one unsinkable calypso. At 8 p.m., Damrosch Park, 62nd Street near Amsterdam Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 875-5766, lincolncenter.org; free. (Chinen)    JIM ROTONDI QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Like the concurrent Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, this two-night club gig, led by the trumpeter Jim Rotondi, pays homage to that bebop legend. Vincent Herring slips into Parker's alto saxophone chair, with a fine rhythm section consisting of David Hazeltine on piano, Peter Washington on bass and Joe Farnsworth on drums. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $25. (Chinen)    * SPIRIT OF RAHSAAN ROLAND KIRK (Tuesday through Thursday) Rahsaan Roland Kirk, the brilliantly robust saxophonist, receives two sincere tributes at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola next week. The first involves a seven-piece band led by the trombonist Steve Turre, a torch-bearing Kirk alumnus, with ranks that include the saxophonists Billy Harper and Vincent Herring. The second tribute, Bright Moments, is a project of the baritone saxophonist Claire Daly; it follows Mr. Turre's group each night with an after-hours set. Through Sept. 3 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with the Bright Moments set at 11 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, $10 for after-hours sets, with a $10 minimum at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    JEREMY STEIG QUARTET (Thursday) Mr. Steig, an accomplished flutist with a jazz-rock pedigree, leads a group featuring a frequent collaborator, the guitarist Vic Juris. At 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $12, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    HELEN SUNG TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow) The pianist Helen Sung reconvenes the solid rhythm section from her recent album, ''Helenistique'' (Fresh Sound New Talent): Richie Goods on bass and Lewis Nash on drums. At 8 and 9:45 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    WILL VINSON QUINTET (Sunday) This British alto saxophonist pursues a contemporary strain of postbop, with a handful of fellow searchers: the guitarists Adam Rogers and Lage Lund, the bassist Orlando Le Fleming and the drummer Ari Hoenig. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    DAVID WEISS AND POINT OF DEPARTURE QUINTet (Wednesday) An assertive trumpeter and accomplished arranger, Mr. Weiss leads an ensemble well stocked with talent: J. D. Allen on tenor saxophone, Nir Felder on guitar, Luques Curtis on bass and Kendrick Scott on drums. At 10 p.m., Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $15. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Tuesday) Opera can be formal or pure fluff, and this season's program at Glimmerglass, now in its final week, nearly balances the two. On the weightier side is Janacek's dark ''Jenufa'' (tomorrow and Tuesday at 1:30 p.m.) or the complex, smart music of Steven Hartke's new Maupassant-based opera ''The Greater Good'' (tonight at 8, Monday at 1:30 p.m.). Lighter fare is represented by ''The Barber of Seville'' (tomorrow night at 8) and ''The Pirates of Penzance'' (Sunday at 1:30 p.m.). Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255, glimmerglass.org; $69 to $117 tonight through Sunday; $41 to $104 on Monday and Tuesday. (Anne Midgette)    MET IN THE PARKS (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday) New York City picnickers have a busy schedule in summer. The New York Philharmonic entertained thousands last month, and now it's the Metropolitan Opera's turn. The annual ''Met in the Parks'' series is celebrating its 40th anniversary with two popular favorites, ''Rigoletto'' and ''La Traviata.'' The Met's park swoop began last week in Central Park and continues tonight with ''La Traviata'' in Marine Park, Brooklyn, followed by ''Rigoletto'' tomorrow in Orchard Park in the Bronx, ''Traviata'' on Tuesday in the Richmond County Ball Park in Staten Island and ''Rigoletto'' on Wednesday in Cunningham Park in Queens. Casts vary for each performance, but the lineup for tonight's ''Traviata'' features Maureen O'Flynn as Violetta, while tomorrow's ''Rigoletto'' has Norah Amsellem as Gilda, Nancy Fabiola Herrera as Maddalena, José Luis Duval as the Duke of Mantua and Mark Delavan as Rigoletto. On Tuesday Hei-Kyung Hong steps in as Violetta and on Wednesday Olga Makarina sings Gilda. At 8 p.m., (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; free. (Vivien Schweitzer)    NEW YORK GRAND OPERA (Tonight) No stranger to Central Park either, this company takes to the outdoors with a staged performance of Puccini's ''Suor Angelica'' and Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci.'' Vincent La Selva, the founder and artistic director, conducts the New York Grand Opera Orchestra and Chorus in Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park. The cast includes Maria Knapik in the title role of ''Suor Angelica'' and as Nedda in ''Pagliacci.'' At 7:30, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 245-8837, newyorkgrandopera.org; free. (Schweitzer)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and it offers ample musical variety this week. Tonight, Vadim Rubinskiy will give a piano recital that includes his own works (among them ''A Musical Portrait of Franz Liszt'') as well as Busoni's arrangement of Bach organ preludes, and Liszt's fantasies on themes from Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro'' and Verdi's ''Rigoletto.'' Tomorrow and Sunday, Daredjan Baya Kakouberi, a pianist; Ilya Kaler, a violinist; and Eugene Osadchy, a cellist; play trios by Mozart, Smetana and Dvorak. And on Thursday another trio -- Olga Vinokur, pianist; Mark Peskanov, violinist; and Edward Arron, cellist -- perform a new work by Behzad Ranjbaran, commissioned by Bargemusic, as well as the Brahms Trio No. 3 and the Tchaikovsky Trio (Op. 50). Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday. (Allan Kozinn)    MAVERICK CONCERTS (Sunday) This concert series near Woodstock holds performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. On Sunday, the pianist Ursula Oppens joins the Rossetti String Quartet in Shostakovich's Piano Quintet in G minor, on a program that also includes Mozart's String Quartet in D (K. 499) and Piazzolla's ''Tango Ballet.'' At 3 p.m., Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845) 679-8217, maverickconcerts.org; $20. (Kozinn)    MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL (Tonight and tomorrow) Ending a Mozart festival in a major Mozart anniversary year with a program of the composer's last three symphonies may seem a predictable idea. But in just a few seasons as music director of Mostly Mozart, the conductor Louis Langrée, working closely with the artistic director, Jane S. Moss, has re-energized this festival, which had grown stodgy until Mr. Langrée took over in late 2002. He has given audiences so many fresh and unusual programs and so inspired the festival orchestra that he has earned the right to end the festival with a program offering the familiar Symphonies Nos. 39, 40 and 41 (''Jupiter''). Expect the performances, like most of Mr. Langrée's work, to be lithe, bracing and free of interpretive agenda. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $38 to $60. (Anthony Tommasini)    TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) The final weekend's hottest concert may well be its first. Tonight's program features the Venezuelan rising star conductor Gustavo Dudamel (if you haven't heard of him yet, you will) leading Imogen Cooper in Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and another rising star, the young mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard, in Falla's ''Three-Cornered Hat.'' Tomorrow's concert may be the leading sentimental favorite. It pairs the Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2 (with Emanuel Ax) and Bruckner's beloved Seventh Symphony in the capable and oft-underrated hands of Herbert Blomstedt. And the end? All Beethoven, as Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos on Sunday leads Yefim Bronfman in the Piano Concerto No. 4, and the orchestra in the Symphony No. 7. Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200, tanglewood.org; $8.50 to $87. (Midgette)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    RONALD K. BROWN/EVIDENCE DANCE COMPANY (Tomorrow) In ''On Our Toes in the Hamptons,'' an open-air fund-raising gala for the company that will be in a sculpture park, Mr. Brown's dancers will perform a new work, ''Truth Don Die.'' They will also perform ''Grace,'' a signature work by Mr. Brown embodying his distinctive way of mixing Afro-Caribbean and modern dance to create a piece that vibrates with humanity and, yes, grace. Tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. (The event begins with a preperformance party at 4 p.m.) Nova's Ark Project, 60 Millstone Road, Bridgehampton, (718) 230-4633, evidencedance.com; $500 to $20,000. (Jennifer Dunning)    CITY PARKS DANCE (Tomorrow and Sunday) This ingenious outdoor series, which includes preperformance dance instruction for the audience, continues with two events in Queens this weekend. Rennie Harris/Puremovement, which performs a stylish blend of hip-hop and modern dance, shares the first program tomorrow with the Ballet Hispanico Student Ensemble, which mixes ballet, modern and Latin dance. On Sunday comes traditional Senegalese dance performed by Sing Sing Rhythms, featuring the master drummer Cheikh Tairou M'Baye and his family, who will teach the day's class. Next taking the floor will be Batoto Yetu, an exuberant children's company that performs dance and music drawn from African traditions. Tomorrow and Sunday at 3 p.m., Queensbridge Park, 41st Avenue and Vernon Boulevard, Queens, (212) 360-8290, cityparksfoundation.org. (Dunning)    DOWNTOWN DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) This outdoor festival closes its 25th-anniversary season with two shows incorporating dance styles from various continents. Tomorrow, ''Ocean of Light'' pays homage to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Asian tsunami in a piece that combines classical with contemporary South Asian dance and music. Also performing will be Battery Dance Company in a program that includes Indian Kathak, Japanese traditional dance mixed with hip-hop, ballet and modern dance. On Sunday seven companies, including the Peridance Ensemble, Dzul Dance and Slamfest, will perform in a closing show that ranges from the tango to Filipino folk dancing. Tomorrow and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m., Great Lawn at Battery Park, enter at State Street, Lower Manhattan, batterydance.org; free. (Dunning)    SITELINES: ELLIS WOOD DANCE (Monday through Wednesday) In the last installment of this festival, 20 women will move across exterior balconies of an ornate old downtown building in Ms. Wood's new ''Fire on Wall Street,'' which explores the element of fire with what the choreographer describes as sensual abandon. Position those safety nets. Monday through Wednesday at noon and 12:30 p.m., Cipriani, 55 Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, lmcc.net; free. (Dunning)    * JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) This is the last weekend for this bucolic Berkshires summer festival. Mark Morris's busy Dance Group is at the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend, with an extra show added for this afternoon. In the smaller Doris Duke Studio Theater is Rubberbandance Group, which comes from Montreal and combines hip-hop with contemporary ballet, also with an extra Friday matinee. Morris today at 3 and 8 p.m., tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Shawn Theater, $58. Rubberbandance today at 2 and 8:15 p.m., tomorrow at 2:15 and 8:15 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Duke Theater, $24. Ten percent off all tickets for students, seniors 65+ and children. Details of the weekend's free performances and exhibitions are at jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745. (John Rockwell)    GARTH FAGAN DANCE (Tonight and tomorrow) Garth Fagan's awards, which include an Olivier and a Tony, for his choreography for ''The Lion King,'' and more Bessies than you can count, are as wide-ranging as his technique, which mixes Afro-Caribbean, ballet and modern dance. The company celebrates its 35th-anniversary season with performances at Lincoln Center Out of Doors. At 8 p.m., Damrosch Park Bandshell, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5766 or lincolncenter.org; free. (Erika Kinetz)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith)    * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Holland Cotter)    Guild Hall Museum: 'Elizabeth Peyton,'  through Oct. 22. Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Queen Elizabeth are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. Romantic feeling connects the form and content in Ms. Peyton's work. A kind of erotic yearning animates how she sees her subjects and how she makes her pictures. To paint, Ms. Peyton's works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806. (Johnson)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    Katonah Museum of Art: 'Andromeda Hotel, the Art of Joseph Cornell,'  through Sept. 17. Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. In this show the white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled ''Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni'' (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of the artist's adoration. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, ''Hotel de l'Étoile'' (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-9555, katonahmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual, reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * Met: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 4 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    MET: 'On Photography: A Tribute to Susan Sontag,' through Sept. 4. How to honor the memory of a multifarious figure like Susan Sontag? The Metropolitan Museum's solution -- a small, grave, beautiful photography show -- is an apt one, with pictures by many of the artists she wrote about, from Diane Arbus to Walker Evans, a portrait of one of her early heroes, Oscar Wilde, and two of Sontag herself. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    Morgan Library & Museum: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, through Oct. 1. On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Smith)    Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and usable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org. (Smith)    * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)    NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)     New York Botanical Garden: Chihuly at the New York Botanical Garden, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Johnson)    * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art' This museum is an oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems into a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)    Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    YES BRUCE NAUMAN There has never been much in the way of ''No'' to the influential Post-Minimalist and sculptor-of-all-trades Bruce Nauman. But this astutely structured, if male-dominated, exhibition considers his importance anew, especially his use of language, neon and the body, and his visceral sense of form. The show's title is taken from a 1989 work by Jessica Diamond that is included, along with pertinent efforts by Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, Glenn Ligon, Jason Rhoades, Peter Coffin, Diana Thater, John Bock and, of course, Mr. Nauman himself. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Sept. 9. (The gallery will be closed Aug. 21 through Aug. 25.) (Smith)    Galleries: Chelsea    * GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    HANS RICHTER (1888-1976), DADA; ART AND ANTI-ART This daunting yet partial survey is clogged with late paintings and reliefs that are for the most part elegant pastiches of Constructivism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. But it should be seen for the four short films from the 1920's, in which Richter's formalist and Dada sides balance beautifully, with elegantly Surrealist results. This is especially the case in the luminous ''Ghosts Before Breakfast,'' from 1927, which explores most of film's structural possibilities and segues briskly between abstraction and Hollywood narrative while three skittering bowler hats provide continuity. Maya Stendhal Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    'WAR ON 45/MY MIRRORS ARE PAINTED BLACK (FOR YOU)' The latest word from the boys in black is a show of six artists organized by the head boy, Banks Violette. The stark glamour of it cannot be denied, but it looks too much like graphic design. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Sept. 2. (Smith)    * JAMES J. WILLIAMS III: 'BY REQUEST, MY EPITAPH' Despite debts to artists like Jack Pierson, Karen Kilimnik, Richard Prince and Nan Goldin, this Haversham-ish environment and solo debut exude a promising fusion of modesty and narcissism. Its deep teal walls display scores of Polaroids, drawings, collages, notebooks and thrift-shop-worthy paintings, along with many of the artist's well-worn belongings. An illusion of stylish, if impoverished, full disclosure results. Self-conscious bohemianism teeters between nostalgia and irony, and art emerges as an incessant if nonchalant activity at the center of an eked-out existence. Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 242-7524, envoygallery.com, through Sept. 9. (Smith)    'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)    Last Chance    Bruce Museum: 'Best in Show: Dogs in Art From the Renaissance to the Present,' This show is a dog lover's picnic, with paintings that celebrate canis lupus familiaris and its wayward ways. 1 Museum Drive, Greenwich, Conn.; (203) 869-0376, closes Sunday. (Glueck)    'Garden Improvement' A mobile, solar-powered ornamental fountain by Charles Goldman; a collection of diminutive Jewel Orchids in silicon rubber planters by Paula Hayes; and a parody of a low-budget history museum exhibit by Jimbo Blachly and Lytle Shaw are among the works in an indoor-outdoor show about relations between nature and culture. Wave Hill, 249th Street and Independence Avenue (front gate), (718) 549-3200, closes Sunday. (Johnson)    * INternational Center of Photography: 'atta kim: On Air,' The South Korean artist Atta Kim's best-known body of work is a series called ''The Museum Project'' (1995-2002), for which he photographed his human subjects -- families, nude couples, maimed war veterans -- locked inside plexiglass exhibition cases like specimens on display. The series eventually took a religious turn, with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures here, in his first major American solo show, continue this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org, closes Sunday. (Cotter)    * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' . From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best-known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org, closes Sunday. (Cotter)    'Materiality' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, closes today. (Johnson)    * met: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, closes Sunday. (Kimmelman)    * Howardena Pindell: 'In My Lifetime' Thirty years ago Howardena Pindell was well known for meditative, process-based abstract work, though her art has always had two aspects. In the 1970's and 80's it assumed and maintained an overtly political direction in large-scale pieces that combined abstraction, words and figures to deal with social and political issues, from AIDS and homelessness to the present war in Iraq. Both types are in this informal gallery retrospective, which makes clear how thoroughly they are based on -- and emerge from and are fueled and inflected by -- the individual experiences and memories of the artist herself. G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 316, (212) 929-6645, grnnamdi.com, closes Thursday. (Cotter)    'Small Wonders' Bucking the big-picture trend, this absorbing show presents 45 black-and-white photographs ranging from palm to postage-stamp size. They include classic portraits by Edward Weston and Berenice Abbott; André Kertesz's William-Blake-like image of a naked man walking into a field of tall grass; and Walter Auerbach's picture of Willem de Kooning's studio circa 1950. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 989-7600, closes today.

If you were one of the people who missed the 17,162 performances of this show the last time around, good news: Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones's romantic musical, which closed in 2002, is back (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100.    'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' In previews; opens on Monday. Meryl Streep plays the title character in Tony Kushner's translation of Brecht's seminal play about a world at war. Kevin Kline also stars, and George C. Wolfe directs (2:30).

Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737.    'SEVEN GUITARS' In previews; opens on Thursday. Signature Theater presents its first August Wilson revival since the playwright's death last year. Ruben Santiago-Hudson, who starred in the 1996 Broadway production, directs (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.    Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'KIKI AND HERB: ALIVE ON BROADWAY' This transcendental lounge act -- made up of Kiki (Justin Bond), a molting songbird for all seasons, and Herb (Kenny Mellman), her happily suffering shadow and accompanist -- has the heat and dazzle of great balls of fire. Vital, funny and surprisingly affecting (2:00). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ANAIS NIN: ONE OF HER LIVES' Angela Christian is superb as Nin in this uneven but largely rewarding production about her affair with Henry Miller and his wife, June, in Paris in the 1930's (1:30). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)    'CREATION: A CLOWN SHOW' Lucas Caleb Rooney is a cross between Red Skelton and Will Ferrell in this sweet, funny, poignant mostly one-man show about the Bible story of earth's first seven days (1:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'EVERYTHINgS TURNING INTO BEAUTIFUL' Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's thrill-free demi-musical about a pair of commitment-wary songwriters (Daphne Rubin Vega and Malik Yoba) is clearly intended to progress from wintry loneliness to heated confrontation and eroticism. But it remains stolidly at room temperature. Directed by Carl Forsman, with songs by Jimmie James. (1:50). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'SHOUT!' A mini-skirted, go-go booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the show room of a Carnival Cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A STONE CARVER' Despite the high cliché factor, William Mastrosimone's play about an Italian immigrant who is losing his house to a highway exit is timely and sporadically touching, in large part because of Dan Lauria's over-the-top performance as the title character and old-world patriarch who makes a mean barrel of wine and never talks when he can shout (1:40). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Andrea Stevens)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'THE DISPUTE' Marivaux's 1744 comedy about sex roles is like a sci-fi romance and, in the hands of the National Asian American Theater Company, an enchanting piece of theater (1:10). The Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    Spectacles    'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims at a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition that's come to visit the South Street Seaport this summer. Spiegeltent, at the former site of the Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'AMAJUBA: LIKE DOVES WE RISE' Tormenting memories dissolve into soaring music, and pain is salved by a collective embrace in this heartfelt, powerfully performed theater piece about life under apartheid. The recollections of the five cast members and authors are woven together with a cappella performances of spirituals from the apartheid years and vignettes performed by the full cast. The actors all but glow with a sense of mission, as if telling their stories has given them new purpose and power (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE & OTHER STORY BOOKS' This children's musical, made up of 10 sketches based on 8 books, is diverse, adorable and free. Also, the adults laugh (1:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 642-9033; closing tonight. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott)    'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)    'The Beales of Grey Gardens' (No rating, 90 minutes) The Maysles brothers dig into their archives for this collection of outtakes from ''Grey Gardens,'' their 1975 cinema vérité classic about the most fascinating cat ladies in the Hamptons. Essential viewing for drag queens. (Nathan Lee)    'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    * 'THE BRIDESMAID' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) The great Claude Chabrol again takes up a sharp instrument and directs it at one of his favorite targets, the family. Yet while his aim remains true, his touch has become gentler, more forgiving. (Dargis) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt- putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    'Calvaire' (No rating, 90 minutes) In this pretentious horror flick from the Belgian newcomer Fabrice du Welz, a lounge singer (Lucus Laurent) plays the girl in an all-male nightmare populated by savagely violent cretins. (Dargis)    'The Celestine Prophecy' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis)    * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)    'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)    'CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN' (No rating, 84 minutes) Two old flames meet, years after parting, and have a short fling. An arch, banal conceit, of some interest for Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter's performances and the split-screen gimmick that keeps them apart even in their intimate moments. (Scott)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    * 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)    * 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haut-bourgeois Parisian marriage, about 1912. (Dargis)    'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden)    * 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)    * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    * 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott)'I Like Killing Flies' (R, 79 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Matt Mahurin paints an engaging if glib portrait of Kenny Shopsin, of the legendary or notorious, depending on your experience, Greenwich Village eatery that bears his name. (Dargis)    'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)    * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)    'Lunacy' (No rating, 118 minutes) In the latest phantasmagoria from the Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer, a young man (Pavel Liska) meets an aristocrat (Jan Triska) and, with help from Edgar Allan Poe and the Marquis de Sade, tumbles down a very strange rabbit hole. (Dargis)    * 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)    * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)    'MOONLIGHT' (No rating, 90 minutes) In the English-language Dutch thriller ''Moonlight,'' a 13-year-old girl (Laurien Van den Broeck) and a young Afghan drug courier fall in love while fleeing his employers. Though the film is rife with topics and images American audiences may find offensive, the director, Paula van der Oest, addresses them fearlessly and with some artistry, creating a fevered fairy tale that suggests that the veneer of civilization is a thin one. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Arabic, English and Kurdish) Filmed in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2005, ''My Country, My Country'' views the prelude to the January elections primarily through the eyes of Dr. Riyadh, a Sunni candidate and physician who runs a free clinic in Baghdad. Without comment but with unusual sensitivity, the director, Laura Poitras, exposes the emotional toll of occupation on Iraqis and United States soldiers alike, leaving us feeling that this particular mission is far from accomplished. (Catsoulis)    'THE NIGHT LISTENER' (R, 82 minutes) Robin Williams plays a writer and radio host who strikes up a long-distance friendship with a young man who may not exist. An intriguing premise, but not satisfyingly realized. (Scott)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'Pulse' (PG-13, 87 minutes) Evil technology menaces idiotic teenagers in this cynical remake of a Japanese horror film. (Lee)    * 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    'Satellite' (No rating, 100 minutes) In this captivating romantic fairy tale for grown-ups, made on a shoestring, two young lovers in New York flee yuppie hell into a life of petty theft. (Holden)    * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)    'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott)    '13 Tzameti'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)    'The Trouble With Men and Women' (No rating, 74 minutes) This tiny, well-acted movie about the romantic troubles besetting two young couples in London feels at once utterly real and banal. (Holden)    * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. (Dargis)    * 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    'You, Me and Dupree' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)    'Zoom' (PG, 83 minutes) Tim Allen is Jack Shepard, a k a Captain Zoom, a washed-up superhero called back into service to train a group of gifted kids for a secret mission to save Earth. Too infantile for tweens and too stagnant for tots, ''Zoom'' bleeds boredom from every frame. The younger cast members work hard, but no superpower on earth can neutralize Mr. Allen's weary shtick. (Catsoulis)    Film Series    THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS (Through Sept. 25) Film Forum's eight-film, eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) continues on Monday night with ''Seven Chances'' (1925), about a man who will inherit $7 million (real money back then) if he gets married -- immediately. Also playing is ''Three Ages'' (1923), a romantic comedy set in the Stone Age, ancient Rome and the 20th century. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates)    FRANK BORZAGE, HOLLYWOOD ROMANTIC (Through Sunday) The 24-film retrospective of Borzage (1893-1962) winds up at the Museum of the Moving Image with four 1940's films this weekend. The closing feature is ''I've Always Loved You'' (1946), a Technicolor B movie about a concert pianist (Catherine McLeod) torn between her maestro and the boy back home. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    FROM THE TSARS TO THE STARS: A JOURNEY THROUGH RUSSIAN FANTASTIK CINEMA (Through Aug. 24) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's tribute to Russian science fiction and fantasy films continues. This weekend's features include Pavel Klushanstev's ''Planet of Storms'' (1961), about cosmonauts who find prehistoric beasts on Venus, and Aleksandr Ptushko's last film, ''Ruslan and Ludmila'' (1972), which features a sorcerer, a hunchbacked witch and a kidnapped bride. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Ikiru'' (1952), starring Takashi Shimura as an office bureaucrat who learns that he has a terminal illness. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates)    THE LEADING MEN OF FRENCH CINEMA (Through Aug. 27) BAMcinématek's tribute to 17 French actors continues this weekend. The attractions include Maurice Ronet in Louis Malle's ''Fire Within'' (1963), about a recovering alcoholic just out of rehab, and Jean-Louis Trintignant in ''My Night at Maud's'' (1969), Éric Rohmer's Oscar-nominated drama about a good Roman Catholic's encounter with a seductive divorcée. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    RAISING HELL: SAM PECKINPAH (Through Aug. 29) BAMcinématek's monthlong tribute to Peckinpah (1925-1984) continues. Monday night's feature is ''The Killer Elite'' (1975), with James Caan as a wounded spy out for revenge. Tuesday night's is ''Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia'' (1974), starring Warren Oates as a piano player on an unusual bounty hunt in Mexico. BAM Rose Cinemas, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    'AMSTERJAM' (Tomorrow) The concept: a handful of big-name acts from disparate pop genres pair up for live mash-ups, playing two or more songs simultaneously in search of playful serendipities. In the hands of skilled (and computer-assisted) producers, the gimmick can have astonishing effects, but there is good reason that it is not often attempted live. The ringmaster: the R & B superproducer Jermaine Dupri (Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson). The players: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with the Foo Fighters; L L Cool J with the reggaetón star Tego Calderón; and Busta Rhymes with the Latin band Yerba Buena. At 3 p.m., Randalls Island, near Icahn Stadium, 1 Randalls Island, (212) 307-7171, amsterjam.com; $57. (Ben Sisario)    ARCHIE BELL, THE MIGHTY HANNIBAL (Sunday) Not everyone playing at the McCarren Park Pool this summer is under 30 and shops at American Apparel. In 1968 Archie Bell, with his band the Drells, scored one of the great R & B novelty hits with ''Tighten Up,'' a combination dance-instruction and introduce-the-band number that is blessedly aimless. The turbaned Mighty Hannibal began his career in 1958 with ''Big Chief Hug-Um an' Kiss-Um'' and went on to record great soul-funk nuggets like ''Jerkin' the Dog'' and ''Get in the Groove.'' At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, thepoolparties.com; free. Mr. Bell also plays on Monday at 9:30 p.m. at Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario)    CHARLES BISSELL (Tuesday) In the Wrens, a New Jersey indie-rock band that formed in the late 1980's and is known as much for its struggles in making records as for its wonderful music, Mr. Bissell sings about exhaustion, day jobs and failed dreams with an intensity seldom matched by rockers half his age. While fans wait for a new album -- they are used to waiting -- Mr. Bissell is playing in residence on Tuesday nights in the small Tap Bar downstairs at the Knitting Factory. With Koester. At 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $8. (Sisario)    * MARIAH CAREY (Wednesday) Before there was ''Idol'' there was Mariah, who made octave-hopping melisma a sport and never met a song she couldn't ride to No. 1. Young singers afraid of being a flash in the pan could learn a lot from her recent comeback, which relied on fresh and up-to-date hip-hop producers and songwriters. With Sean Paul. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $19.50 to $154.50 (Sisario)    NEKO CASE, JOANNA NEWSOM, MARTHA WAINWRIGHT (Thursday) A decade ago the most influential women in rock were the angry ones. Now it might be the mellow women's turn. Neko Case began in punk and indie-rock bands before finding herself and her voice -- a bewitching, burgundy alto -- in country-tinged Southern gothic. With a froggy, girlish voice, Joanna Newsom plays elegant and completely entrancing reveries on the harp. Martha Wainwright's passionate and earthy songs swirl from her acoustic guitar into grand arrangements but never lose their intimacy. At 5 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $32.50 in advance, $36 at the door. (Sisario)    CROSBY, STILLS, NASH AND YOUNG (Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) It's the fourth partner, Neil Young, who just might push this alliance beyond self-satisfied baby-boom nostalgia and vocal harmonies into something like rock. Sunday at 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; sold out. Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 8, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $46 to $251. (Jon Pareles)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133, dannysgrandseapalace.com; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Stephen Holden)    FOO FIGHTERS, FRANK BLACK (Monday) The Foo Fighters' long-promised acoustic tour is a family affair. Joining Dave Grohl and his band will be Pat Smear, of the great Los Angeles punk group the Germs in the 1970's, and who was an auxiliary member of Nirvana in the 90's; and the violinist Petra Hayden and the keyboardist Rami Jaffee, who both played on the Foo Fighters' most recent album, ''In Your Honor'' (RCA).

(Sisario)    DIAMANDA GALÁS (Thursday) Though she is invariably dressed in black, with her face in witchy streaks of makeup, Diamanda Galás needs only her voice to terrify, seduce and beguile. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. In the third of four shows at the Spiegeltent downtown, she offers songs associated with Marlene Dietrich, Peggy Lee, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Édith Piaf and Timi Yuro. At 6 p.m., Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Sisario)    JAMES GANG (Tomorrow) Before joining the Eagles, Joe Walsh joined this Cleveland blues-boogie band, whose ''Funk #49'' is the platonic ideal of all 70's blues boogies. The band -- which also includes the bassist Dale Peters and the drummer Jim Fox -- has reunited periodically, including at an election rally for Bill Clinton 10 years ago, and is touring this summer. With J D and the Straight Shot. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $63.50 to $128.50.

Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. at the Damrosch Park Bandshell are the 1960's soul vets Eddie Floyd (''Knock on Wood'') and Percy Sledge (''When a Man Loves a Woman'').

(212) 875-5766, lincolncenter.org; free. (Sisario)    MAGIK MARKERS, EXCEPTER, BLUES CONTROL, FERN KNIGHT (Tomorrow) An afternoon of noise rock at the East River Amphitheater, where the most discordant music can sound almost pastoral. The trio Magik Markers' clangorous improvisations reach back to New York's early-1980's No Wave scene. Excepter, from Brooklyn, lists its influences as ''weather, traffic, electricity, magic.'' Blues Control's distorted rumblings sound like Mountain or Cream songs emanating from a sunken submarine. And since no noise-rock show these days is complete without a ''freak folk'' act, Fern Knight, a droney acoustic band from Philadelphia, is on the bill. At 2 p.m., East River Park, south of Delancey Street, Lower East Side, ermp.org; free. (Sisario)    RAUL MALO (Tuesday) Mr. Malo, the leader of the Mavericks, has never let himself be bound by the strictures of country. His music looks back to the 1950's and 60's with a clear-eyed nostalgia, and he has the soaring tenor voice of a dedicated Roy Orbison fan. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $30. (Pareles)    * NEW YORK DOLLS (Tonight) Never say die. With its only two surviving original members well into their 50's, this proto-punk, proto-glam band, which made trashy cross-dressing a rock 'n' roll virtue, recently released its first new album in 32 years, ''One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This'' (Roadrunner), and its appetite for sleazy vamps and hilarious wickedness is undiminished. ''You're designed so intelligent/Ain't no way that was an accident,'' David Johansen sings in ''Dance Like a Monkey.'' ''Come on shake your monkey hips, my pretty little creationist.'' At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, seaportmusicfestival.com; free. (Sisario)    RANCID (Thursday) This long-running band of studious Clash revivalists said two years ago it was going on hiatus, but that didn't last long.

(Sisario)    STEVE RILEY AND THE MAMOU PLAYBOYS (Sunday) The accordionist Steve Riley leads one of the best bands from the Louisiana bayous. It reaches back to some of the oldest Cajun tunes and can play them in traditional style, but it's not afraid of swamp-rock or a touch of country, either. At 7:30 p.m., with a free zydeco dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Pareles)    THE SHINS, J MASCIS (Wednesday) The Shins emerged from Albuquerque at the turn of the millennium with a sound that slowly but inevitably catapulted them to the upper ranks of the indiesphere: wistful and acoustic, with an adventurousness that sometimes leads to something like psychedelia. (Natalie Portman's exhortation in ''Garden State'' that the band's music will ''change your life'' didn't hurt.) J Mascis led Dinosaur Jr., one of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, whose juxtaposition of mopey lyrics and furious guitar sludge prefigured Nirvana. With Sam Jayne. At 6:30 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $35. (Sisario)    * P. F. Sloan (Thursday) One of the few songwriters who can be said to have truly captured the extremes of the 1960's -- he wrote both ''Eve of Destruction'' and ''Secret Agent Man'' -- P. F. Sloan left the music business in the 70's and has mostly stayed out until now. He makes a rare appearance at Joe's Pub on Thursday, two days after the release of ''Sailover'' (Hightone), his first new album in many years. At 7:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario)    * WU-TANG CLAN (Tonight) The eight surviving representatives of hip-hop's most ingenious and eccentric band-cum-brand name team up for a tour in tribute to Russell Tyrone Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, the especially ingenious, eccentric and self-destructive member who died in 2004. With Lord Jamar. At 7, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $50.

(Chinen)    CHARLIE HADEN'S QUARTET WEST (Tonight through Sunday) In 20 years Quartet West has never wavered in its commitment to romance. The heart of the group is Ernie Watts, with his ardent tenor saxophone style; its soul is the bass playing of Mr. Haden. Alan Broadbent's sophisticated piano playing and arranging could be, so to speak, its brain. Rodney Green fills in for Larance Marable on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen)    MATT DARRIAU'S PARADOX TRIO (Tonight) The exuberant Balkan fusion once associated with the Knitting Factory is still kicking; at least it is for this band, which issued an album on Enja last year. In addition to Mr. Darriau's clarinet, alto saxophone and gaida (or Balkan bagpipe), Paradox Trio features the electric guitar of Brad Shepik, the cello of Rufus Cappadocia and the percussion of Seido Salifoski.

Tomorrow and Sunday at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15.

(Chinen)    * ROY HAYNES FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) The redoubtable drummer Roy Haynes is in his 80's, though you'd never guess it by the freshness and ferocity of his playing. His working quartet features musicians many years his junior: the alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, the pianist Martin Bejerano and the bassist David Wong. Through Aug. 27. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    ARI HOENIG AND CHRIS POTTER (Tonight) Mr. Hoenig, a drummer, and Mr. Potter, a saxophonist, are two of the sharpest musicians in modern post-bop circles, and their duo exchange is a thing of intensity and poise. At 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; no cover. (Chinen)    LAN XANG (Wednesday) This quartet was a compact powerhouse on the experimental scene in the middle to late 1990's, after which its four members -- the saxophonists Donny McCaslin and Dave Binney, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Kenny Wollesen -- separately established successful careers. They have all crossed paths often, but this one-night engagement marks a rare reunion. At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    TANIA MARIA (Tuesday through Thursday) On her album ''Intimidade,'' recently released on Blue Note, Tania Maria applies her conversational vocals and piano playing to a brand of acoustic pop well seasoned by the sound of her native Brazil. She'll create a similar fusion here with a group consisting of the bassist Sergio Brandao and the percussionists Rick Sebastian and Mestre Carneiro. Through Aug. 27. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen)    MULGREW MILLER AND WINGSPAN (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Miller is a pianist with an earthy style and a particular gift for the blues. But his ensemble Wingspan pursues a distinctly airy sensibility, with help from the saxophonist Steve Wilson, the trumpeter Duane Eubanks, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the bassist Ivan Taylor and the drummer Rodney Green. Through Aug. 27. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25.

(Chinen)    DAVID SÁNCHEZ QUARTET (Through Sunday) A tenor and soprano saxophonist equally conversant in the rigors of post-bop and the nuances of Latin folk music, Mr. Sánchez digs in here with some longtime colleagues: Edsel Gomez on piano, Ben Street on bass and Adam Cruz on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    JENNY SCHEINMAN TRIO (Thursday through Sunday) Jenny Scheinman is a violinist attracted to rusticity but committed to a modern language; the same could be said, more or less, of the drummer Paul Motian and the pianist Jason Moran. Still, this all-star trio carries the burden of a small spectacle: it could be transcendent or a train wreck, and either way it will be something to behold. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)    * CHRISTIAN SCOTT SEXTET/ERIC PERSON'S META-FOUR (Tonight) Christian Scott is an excellent young trumpeter whose recent debut, ''Rewind That'' (Concord), signaled his intention to establish a modern funk-based sound; he succeeded, but at the cost of spontaneity, a problem that will probably not resurface here. Also on the bill is Meta-Four, a group led by Mr. Person, a saxophonist and composer. At 9 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $18, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND (Tonight through Sunday) Charles Tolliver leads an upgraded edition of his acclaimed orchestra of the 1970's, with such top-shelf talent as the saxophonists Billy Harper and Craig Handy, the trombonist Clark Gayton, the pianist Robert Glasper and the bassist Cecil McBee. The band will be featured on a forthcoming Blue Note album, but that's no reason not to absorb its visceral impact in person. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    TAKE TORIYAMA'S TBA (Tonight) Mr. Toriyama is a drummer with ever-expanding credentials in the Brooklyn experimental scene.

(Chinen)    * RANDY WESTON (Wednesday) The pianist Randy Weston has been one of the principal agents of an African jazz aesthetic since his first visit to Nigeria, in the 1960's. He turned 80 this year, the ostensible reason for this special concert, which assembles a number of guests, including the saxophonists Dewey Redman and Billy Harper, the conga legend Candido Camero, the pipa player Min Xiao Fen and the kora player Abdou Mboup. At 8 p.m., Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5766; free.

All four of this year's operas are in rotation over the next week, with the lighter side predominating: Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance'' (today at 1:30 and 8 p.m., Monday at 1:30 p.m.); Rossini's classic ''Barber of Seville'' (tomorrow and Tuesday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday night at 8); Steven Hartke's new Maupassant-based opera ''The Greater Good'' (tomorrow night at 8); and Janacek's dark ''Jenufa,'' in Jonathan Miller's production (Sunday afternoon at 1:30).

(Anne Midgette)    'IDOMENEO'  (Wednesday) William Christie and Les Arts Florissants have attained something like rock-star status in the early-music world as they help illuminate all kinds of unexpected corners of the 17th- and 18th-century repertory. Mozart's opera seria ''Idomeneo'' is practically pop compared with some of the more obscure works the group has championed. But it has done some fine Mozart performances, and expectations are high for this one. Paul Agnew takes the title role in this semistaged production. At 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $75.

The tour begins on Tuesday at the Great Lawn in Central Park with Verdi's ''Traviata,'' starring the luminous soprano Hei-Kyung Hong as Violetta.

In the evening Mr. Botstein will lead the American Symphony Orchestra in Liszt's ''Faust Symphony'' and in excerpts from his oratorio ''Christus'' and Berlioz's ''Enfance du Christ.'' The apparent aim of Sunday's afternoon program is to reveal a mature, spiritual Liszt by focusing on his chamber and choral works.

(Midgette)    TANNERY POND CONCERTS (Tomorrow) Christian Steiner is well known for his photography, and less well known, perhaps, as a musician. But he is least known as the artistic director of this lovely little concert series, for which he lures leading musicians up to the Berkshires (over the New York border) to perform in an enchanting little wooden hall. This weekend Wu Han and David Finckel, the husband-and-wife collaborators as pianist and cellist who are also the artistic directors of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, let their hair down with their close colleague Da-Hong Seetoo, a violinist, in a program of Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky. At 8 p.m., Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, New Lebanon, N.Y., (888) 820-9441, tannerypondconcerts.org; $25 and $30. (Midgette)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    ARIANE ANTHONY AND CEDRIC NEUGEBAUER (Tonight and tomorrow night) The wildly imaginative Ms. Anthony will present a new collaboration with Mr. Neugebauer, as well as a recent solo, ''Snail,'' with costumes of wearable sculpture by Agata Oleksiak and music by John Stone. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Field's FAR Space, 521 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (718) 349-0008; suggested donation, $10. (Jennifer Dunning)    BATTERY DANCE COMPANY: DOWNTOWN DANCE FESTIVAL (Monday through Thursday) A rite of summer now in its 25th year, this festival will present 16 companies and a wide range of styles in two downtown locations, through Aug. 27. The centerpiece is probably ''Oceans of Light,'' on a shared program on Thursday with Kathak Ensemble, in which modern dancers from New Orleans will perform with South Asian classical dancers. The work pays homage to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Asian tsunami by exploring water's beauty, grace and wrath. Monday through Thursday from noon to 1:30 p.m., Chase Plaza, Nassau Street between Liberty and Pine Streets, Lower Manhattan, batterydance.org; free. (Dunning)    CEDAR LAKE CONTEMPORARY BALLET (Thursday) For an informal Thursday evening series this month, the company opens up its intimate theater to the street and turns it into an installation for a 90-minute program of multimedia dance created by company members. At 6 p.m., Cedar Lake Theater, 547 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-0015, cedarlakedance.com; free. (Dunning)    CHOREOGRAPHY CAFÉ (Wednesday) Jeremy Nelson is the featured artist in this informal series presented by Dancewave, which invites professional choreographers to work with child and teenage dancers. At 2:15 p.m., Old First Reformed Church, 729 Carroll Street, at Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 522-4696, dancewave.org; free. (Dunning)    CITY PARKS DANCE (Tomorrow) Nicholasleichterdance, which fuses modern dance and pop-culture movement, and Jamel Gaines's Creative Outlet Dance Theater of Brooklyn, which addresses sociocultural themes in movement, theater, song and poetry, will share the bill in this program. Mr. Gaines will teach the open dance class that begins the event. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Von King Park, 670 Lafayette Avenue, between Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (212) 360-8290, cityparksfoundation.org; free. (Dunning)    'GRIMM' (Thursday) Otis Cook, choreographer for Momix, and Faith Pilger, a dancer and choreographer, have created in ''Grimm'' a dance theater piece that explores fear and parenthood, rebellion and discovery, through a retelling of ''Hansel and Gretel.'' Through Aug. 27. At 8 p.m., the Duke, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, agrimmproduction.com; $30; $20 for students and 65+; $15 for children. (Dunning)    * JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Peter Boal's Pacific Northwest Ballet from Seattle, or at least a touring ensemble, will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend, followed there Tuesday through Thursday (and next weekend, to the end of this summer's festival) by the Mark Morris Dance Group. In the smaller Doris Duke Studio Theater, Choreftes, a Greek company in its United States debut, plays through the weekend, and moving in on Thursday through next weekend is Rubberbandance Group, which comes from Montreal and combines hip-hop with contemporary ballet. Pacific Northwest Ballet, tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m., $50; Morris, Tuesday through Thursday nights at 8, $58, Shawn Theater. Choreftes, tonight and tomorrow night at 8:15, tomorrow at 2:15 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m.; Rubberbandance, Thursday at 8:15 p.m., Duke Theater, $24.

Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745. (John Rockwell)    * 'MOZART DANCES' (Tonight and tomorrow night) Another month, another major work from Mark Morris. This one was commissioned by the Mostly Mozart Festival and offers the Mark Morris Dance Group performing to two Mozart piano concertos (K. 413 and 595) and the Sonata in D for two pianos (K. 448), with Louis Langrée conducting the Festival Orchestra and the pianists Emanuel Ax and Yoko Nozaki. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $25 to $75. (Rockwell)    NICHOLAS ANDRE DANCE THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Directed by Nick Seligson-Ross, the company will perform five pieces set to composers including Handel and Mancini. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, nicholasandredance.com; $19 and $35 in advance, and $20 and $36 at the door. (Dunning)    RIVER TO RIVER FESTIVAL (Today) The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Sitelines series offers ''Oasis,'' a performance by H. T. Chen and Sharon Estacio that celebrates parks as gathering spaces. Today at 12:30 p.m., Columbus Park, intersection of Baxter, Mulberry, Worth and Bayard Streets, Chinatown, rivertorivernyc.com; free. (Jack Anderson)    SITELINES: ELLIS WOOD DANCE (Monday through Wednesday) In the last installment of this festival, 20 women will move across exterior balconies of an ornate old downtown building in Ms. Wood's new ''Fire on Wall Street,'' which explores the element of fire with what the choreographer describes as sensual abandon. Position those safety nets. Through Aug. 30. At noon and 12:30 p.m., Cipriani, 55 Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, lmcc.net; free. (Dunning)    SMUIN BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow) A lively San Francisco company offers two new works by Michael Smuin: ''Bluegrass/Slyde,'' to bluegrass music, and ''Symphony of Psalms,'' to Stravinsky. They share the program with ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' to Frank Sinatra recordings. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42.

(Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)    * Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith)    * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Holland Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best-known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 (1114 is the school) Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)    * INternational Center of Photography: 'atta kim: On Air,' through Aug. 27. The South Korean artist Atta Kim's best-known body of work is a series called ''The Museum Project'' (1995-2002), for which he photographed his human subjects -- families, nude couples, maimed war veterans -- locked inside plexiglass exhibition cases like specimens on display. The series eventually took a religious turn, with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures here, in his first major American solo show, continue this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual, reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * met: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Met: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 4 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and usable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org. (Smith)    Museum of Biblical Art: 'The Word on the Street: the photographs of Larry Racioppo,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)    * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)    NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)     New York Botanical Garden: Chihuly at the New York Botanical Garden, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Johnson)    * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Grace Glueck)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art' This museum is an oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)    Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    YES BRUCE NAUMAN There has never been much in the way of ''No'' to the influential Post-Minimalist and sculptor-of-all-trades Bruce Nauman. But this astutely structured, if male-dominated, exhibition considers his importance anew, especially his use of language, neon and the body, and his visceral sense of form. The show's title is taken from a 1989 work by Jessica Diamond that is included, along with pertinent efforts by Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, Glenn Ligon, Jason Rhoades, Peter Coffin, Diana Thater, John Bock and, of course, Mr. Nauman himself. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Sept. 9. (The gallery will be closed Aug. 21 through Aug. 25.) (Smith)    Galleries: Chelsea    * GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    'Materiality' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, through Aug. 25. (Johnson)    * Howardena Pindell: 'In My Lifetime' Thirty years ago Howardena Pindell was well known for meditative, process-based abstract work, though her art has always had two aspects. In the 1970's and 80's it assumed and maintained an overtly political direction in large-scale pieces that combined abstraction, words and figures to deal with social and political issues, from AIDS and homelessness to the present war in Iraq. Both types are in this informal gallery retrospective, which makes clear how thoroughly they are based on -- and emerge from and are fueled and inflected by -- the individual experiences and memories of the artist herself. G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 316, (212) 929-6645, grnnamdi.com, through Aug. 31. (Cotter)    'WAR ON 45/MY MIRRORS ARE PAINTED BLACK (FOR YOU)' The latest word from the boys in black is a show of six artists organized by the head boy, Banks Violette. The stark glamour of it cannot be denied, but it looks too much like graphic design. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Sept. 2. (Smith)    * JAMES J. WILLIAMS III: 'BY REQUEST, MY EPITAPH' Despite debts to artists like Jack Pierson, Karen Kilimnik, Richard Prince and Nan Goldin, this Havershamish environment and solo debut exude a promising fusion of modesty and narcissism. Its deep teal walls display scores of Polaroids, drawings, collages, notebooks and thrift-shop-worthy paintings, along with many of the artist's well-worn belongings. An illusion of stylish, if impoverished, full disclosure results. Self-conscious bohemianism teeters between nostalgia and irony, and art emerges as an incessant if nonchalant activity at the center of an eked-out existence. Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 242-7524, envoygallery.com, through Sept. 9. (Smith)    Last Chance    * Amer Kobaslija: 'Large-Scale Studio Paintings' Large, exhaustively detailed, sensuously painted fish-eye views of the artist's studio. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 564-8480, georgeadamsgallery.com; closes today. (Johnson)    * 'A BROKEN ARM' The title is a tribute to Duchamp. The works review various strategies of using found objects or images in photography, painting and sculpture. The seven artists include Gedi Sibony, Arnold Odermatt and Karen Kilimnik. All has been orchestrated by Mari Spirito, the gallery's director. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com; closes today. (Smith)    * 'DERECONSTRUCTION' Matthew Higgs, director of the alternative space White Columns, has assembled a handsome show that in typical Higgs fashion brings together outsider, emerging, hip and formerly hip artists. Variations on collage and assemblage predominate without feeling stale. The larger point: deconstruction has had its day, and it is time to start putting things back together again. The putters range from A. R. Penck and Lucas Samaras to Carter and Alexandra Bircken. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com; closes today. (Smith)     'Dreamland: Coney Island, 1905-1925' Coney Island lovers will appreciate this show of early-20th-century photographs, artifacts, drawings and engineering plans. Most surprising are drawings from the W. F. Mangels Company, which built many of the area's amusement park rides and games; the precise, watercolor-tinted shooting gallery drawings look like contemporary artworks. And the wooden carousel horse head is a beautiful piece of sculpture. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-4819, riccomaresca.com; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    'Group Show' Four interesting Conceptualists: Pierre Bismuth folds a giant reproduction of a Jasper Johns flag painting into a Donald Judd-like box; Ryan Gander makes large photographs of bulletin boards bearing puzzling documents; Karl Haendel covers a wall with his large, handmade graphite copies of consumer-culture ephemera; and T. Kelly Mason constructs a walk-in, padded environment with soft, rain-related sounds and a video. Cohan & Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, near 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-8710, cohanandleslie.com; closes today. (Johnson)    'MEN' This show of 10 paintings of men by 10 women, organized by the painter Ellen Altfest, covers a lot of stylistic ground and includes an only partly tongue-in-cheek denunciation from the lesbian collective Redykeulous. Realism makes the strongest impression. I-20, 557 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1100, I-20.com; closes today. (Smith)    New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 or nypl.org; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    'Photography Is Not An Art!' More than 100 examples of vernacular, often anonymous photographs from the fields of medicine, forensics, space exploration and advertising prove that nonart photography is often as interesting as the fine-art variety.

(Johnson)    'Prevailing Climate' This intelligent group show, organized by Rachel Gugelberger and Jeffrey Walkowiak, is about atmospheric conditions and also psychic and political weather. Storms come and go in Joy Garnett's paintings of fiery, storm-swollen skies and in Christoph Draeger's jigsaw-puzzle photograph of the aftermath of a tsunami, while the subject of John Jurayj's vivid paintings of bombed hotels in Beirut speak of a different kind of turbulence.

(Cotter)    'The Social History of Objects,' At present, in some quarters of the art world, there's a push to circle back to a pre-Conceptualist state in which well-fashioned paintings and sculptures are art, and everything else is not. So it makes sense that an against-the-grain space like Triple Candie is offering a group show entirely of ready-mades or, as the gallery puts it, ''common objects collected from friends and acquaintances.'' The range is wide: a baseball cap, a sock, a Plaza Hotel ashtray, a stone chip, each accompanied by a history. Certain items were found by their present owners; others given as hand-me-downs or gifts. A few have been attributed Proustian powers to evoke a time or place or a personality. Together they teach the old Duchamp lesson that art is an attitude, and that the mind is every bit as much a shaping organ as the hand and the eye. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783, triplecandie.org; closes Sunday.
