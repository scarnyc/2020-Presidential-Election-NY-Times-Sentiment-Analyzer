8," A selective listing by Times critics of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.    * ANTIBALAS, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. While the New Museum has a summerlong exhibition devoted to Fela Kuti, the Nigerian bandleader and political gadfly, the band Antibalas discovered his music years ago. It delivers a New York makeover to Fela's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. Performing constantly around New York has given the band a combined tightness and relaxation, the assurance that they can sustain and expand a groove until everyone is dancing. And watching them pack more than a dozen musicians on a small stage is a show in itself. Two sets begin tonight at 9; admission is $12 (Jon Pareles).",https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/15/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-907103.html,,A selective listing by Times critics of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.,The New York Times,[],[],2003-08-15T05:00:00+0000,article,"Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk",Movies,Schedule,nyt://article/4dfb7463-ba36-52a2-b8d7-049d5947d399,2808,nyt://article/4dfb7463-ba36-52a2-b8d7-049d5947d399,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,,,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,,,,,[],,E,25,
