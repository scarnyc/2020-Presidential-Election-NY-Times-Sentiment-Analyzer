0,"On the opening day of the much-anticipated trial of Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, lawyers for the government and the defense on Tuesday told a tale of two Enrons, portraying starkly different versions of why the energy company collapsed in late 2001.      That Enron blazed a path to the summit of the energy world was not in dispute. In the 1990's, it was a Wall Street darling, the pride of an energy city and the creator of an industry that bought and sold natural gas, electricity and anything else its ambitious employees could dream up. But since its bankruptcy, Enron has come to symbolize the corporate malfeasance that infected so many American corporations in the 1990's.

Broadway    'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman from Feb. 14 through March 26. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'ALMOST, MAINE'  John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER'  A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)    * '(I AM) NOBODY'S LUNCH'  The elusive nature of truth in a culture swamped with stuff that looks, sounds and smells like information -- but may be something a little more suspicious -- is the serious subject of this merrily unserious, vaudevillian romp through the anxious chatter of contemporary America. Snappy, scrappy and performed with a youthful blend of earnestness and deadpan razzmatazz by the buzzed-about downtown troupe the Civilians (1:30). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'LOVELY DAY' Tiresome evening (1:15). Beckett Theater, Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION'  An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'HARVEST' Manjula Padmanabhan's sci-fi parable is a dark fantasy about a high-tech racket in body organs -- a cross between the 2002 thriller ''Dirty Pretty Things'' and an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.'' Based in Delhi, India, Ms. Padmanabhan wrote the play in 1996; this is its New York premiere (1:25). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710. (Phoebe Hoban)    * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley)    * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)'  O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ANTON' It is one thing to write a play about Anton Chekhov's last four years, quite another to attempt the master's style, then produce and direct it and portray the title character. Though Pierre van der Spuy's reach far exceeds his grasp, he deserves some credit for trying (2:15). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, between Charlton and Vandam Streets, South Village; (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    *'THE END OF REALITY' Violence isn't pretty in the listless but eventful world of Richard Maxwell's hypnotic new play. It's not ugly, either. In this latest work from the king of affecting disaffection, violence doesn't so much explode as drip, like water from a leaky faucet, into the lives of lonely, hapless security guards. Mr. Maxwell's most eloquent statement to date about the blurring of despair and apathy in American lives (1:40). The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793; closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'GONER' The president is shot, and the world's worst doctors get the job of trying to save him in this very funny bit of sketch comedy disguised as a play. Bad taste seems not to be an issue for the author, Brian Parks, but most of the lunacy is inspired enough that you can forgive the insensitivity (1:15). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'HOUSE OF DESIRE' This 300-year-old farce, written by a nun, mostly proves that Baroque women were just as capable as Baroque men of producing forgettable plays. It's sometimes fun watching the energetic young actors trying to breathe life into it, though, especially during a smashing sword fight conducted in semi-darkness (2:10). Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'MAJOR BARBARA' George Bernard Shaw's polemic against the military-industrial complex and organized religion is still timely 100 years later, and though the director Brooke O'Harra's Kabuki-tinged version lands on the mark and misses it about equally, there is something true and real about the production that is worth seeing (2:35). La MaMa Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing Sunday. (Stevens)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300; closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'WHAT THEN' Even if Rinne Groff's playful play about environmental disaster is occasionally labored, there's never any doubt that there's an active, lively intelligence at work (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)    * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)    'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden)    * 'THE FALL OF FUJIMORI' (No rating, 83 minutes, in English and Spanish) Ellen Perry's examination of Alberto Fujimori, who ruled Peru from 1990 to 2000, is a complex study in the psychology of power and also an unsettling examination of the risks that fighting terrorism can pose to democratic institutions and values. (Scott)    'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott)    'GO FOR ZUCKER' (No rating, 95 minutes, in German) In this German-Jewish comedy, factions of a divided family, half Orthodox Jewish and half secular, join forces to collect an inheritance. It might be described as a hybrid of the much funnier French farce ''La Cage aux Folles'' and the recent Israeli film ''Ushpizin.'' (Holden)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Manohla Dargis)    'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee)    'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee)    * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)    'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis)    'LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Albert Brooks takes his anxious, cerebral act on the road, to India and Pakistan. Great satiric potential, most of it squandered after a hilarious opening. (Scott)    * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)    'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)    'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)    * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'TRISTAN & ISOLDE' (PG-13, 125 minutes) The lovers of Celtic mythology, Arthurian legend and Wagnerian libretto fall for each other far from the violent, Dark Ages machinations plaguing their two warring peoples. A pleasant entertainment from the director Kevin Reynolds that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more. (Dargis)    '24 HOURS ON CRAIGSLIST' (No rating, 82 minutes) Directed (kind of) and produced by Michael Ferris Gibson, a disorganized if watchable stroll through human desire as manifested on the popular Web site (three billion page views each month). (Dargis)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    Film Series    ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILMS IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Feb. 14) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalan film begins tonight with Isabel Coixet's ''Secret Life of Words'' (2005), starring Sarah Polley, Julie Christie and Javier Cámara. Other features will include Antoni Ribas's ''Burned City'' (1976), one of the first Catalan-language films released after the death of Franco; Agustí Villaronga's ''In a Glass Cage'' (1987), a drama about depravity that the American director John Waters has said he found shocking; and ''Fausto 5.0'' (2001), the Catalan theater group La Fura dels Baus's interpretation of Goethe's ''Faust.'' Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Anita Gates)    BEARING THE UNBEARABLE: ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN FILMS ABOUT THE CONFLICT (Through Tuesday) This two-week festival, sponsored by Symphony Space Thalia Films and Labyrinth Books, concludes with three documentaries. Simone Bitton's ''Wall,'' about the Israeli-Palestinian security/separation fence, won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Tahani Rached's ''Soraida, Woman of Palestine'' is about the everyday life of a Ramallah resident. ''Another Road Home,'' by the Israeli filmmaker Danae Elon, looks at Ms. Elon's relationship with the Muslim Palestinian man who was her caregiver. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10. (Gates)    FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Feb. 12) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. This weekend's films are ''Zabriskie Point'' (1970), Michelangelo Antonioni's portrait of alienated American youth in the late 1960's, selected by J. Hoberman, and ''Stroszek'' (1977), Werner Herzog's drama about Europeans in Wisconsin, selected by Michael Atkinson. (To the Europeans, the state seems practically extraterrestrial.) 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION (Through Feb. 6) A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's feature is ''Finding Nemo'' (2003), the story of an overprotective widowed clownfish searching for his son, to be shown with the short ''One Man Band'' (2005), about two street musicians competing for a little girl's only coin. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, M1 (Tonight) The Atlanta hip-hop group Arrested Development's decidedly preachy new-soul peaked too early to make it part of the rise of the ''Dirty South'' style, but it carried the kind of positive messages that characterized lots of early 1990's bohemian rap. M1 is half of the political rap group Dead Prez. 7:30, Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $25. (Laura Sinagra)    BABY DAYLINER (Tonight) Baby Dayliner is the stage name of Ethan Marunas, a keyboard-driven one-man band. He sets up percolating electropop patterns to back neo-cabaret songs that can be droll and cynical or stylishly heartsick. 7:30, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, between Rivington and Stanton Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Jon Pareles)    BLACK DICE, GANG GANG DANCE (Tomorrow) The experimental band Black Dice expands its palette of sharp noise to include ominous electronic glitches, warped meta-blues and churning tribal bursts. The outré, art-folk quartet Gang Gang Dance also plays. 8 p.m., Syrup Room, 100 Ingraham Street, at Knickerbocker Avenue, East Williamsburg Industrial Park, Brooklyn, (917) 608-2467; $10. (Sinagra)    BOBBY (BLUE) BLAND (Sunday) Bobby (Blue) Bland's voice is a cornerstone of Memphis soul singing. In tones that are velvety, humble and long-suffering, he begs for affection with suave melancholy and smoldering fury. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Pareles)    BLUE OYSTER CULT (Tonight) When science fiction met heavy metal and lighthearted fetishism in Blue Oyster Cult songs of the 70's like ''Cities on Flame With Rock 'n' Roll,'' ''(Don't Fear) the Reaper,'' ''Godzilla'' and ''Dominance and Submission,'' it hardly mattered whether the band's original intentions were tongue-in-cheek. Its post-Zeppelin, pre-punk riffs and its wild-eyed lyrics still sound good. 6 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 and $32. (Pareles)    BLUES FALLIN' DOWN LIKE RAIN: THE MUSIC OF CHARLEY PATTON (Wednesday) This New York Guitar Festival tribute to the music of the Delta country blues master Charley Patton features John Hammond, Rory Block, Dave Tronzo, Toshi Reagon and Harry Manx. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $35. (Sinagra)    BONGA'S VODOU DRUMS OF HAITI (Tomorrow) This group of drummers and rhythmic dancers led by Bonga Jean-Baptiste, a former member of the Haitian voodoo-rock band Boukman Eksperyans, performs in a more ritualistic, spiritually inspired Afro-Haitian style. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, at Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; no cover. (Sinagra)    BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Canadian collective makes heartbreak music that sounds like a fuzzy, drunken party. Some prefer its diffuse anthemic feints to the straight-up anthems of its countrymen Arcade Fire. Members have included the Stars' Evan Cranley, Metric's Emily Haines and the multitalented singer-songwriter Leslie Feist. 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25 (sold out). (Sinagra)    EVAN DANDO (Tomorrow) After spending the late 1990's in exile, this alt-pop heartthrob has cleaned up his act and taken tentative steps back into the limelight with solo projects and some revisiting of old hits and matter-of-fact melodicism. 10 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; $15. (Sinagra)    DEERHOOF (Monday) This excitingly whimsical band harbors affection in equal parts for No Wave angularity, exuberant noise-pop and outsider naïf art like that of the Shaggs. Its latest material is more pacific than earlier work, which included an electronically augmented fractured fairy tale about a kidnapping milkman. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra)    BO DIDDLEY (Thursday) When Bo Diddley plays his namesake beat and growls the metaphysical boasts of ''Who Do You Love?,'' it's easy to hear the fire and syncopation that made him a rock pioneer. Behind them is a profound education in the blues. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $32.50 in advance, $35 at the door. (Pareles)    DR. DOG, SAM CHAMPION (Tonight) The lo-fi Philly band Dr. Dog plays likably shaggy rock. The local indie rockers Sam Champion harken back to the slacker ennui of 90's bands like Pavement. 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    DUB NOMADS VS DR. ISRAEL & DREADTONE (Tomorrow) The reggae singer Dr. Israel makes dark dubs that introduce elements of jungle and hard rock. The Dub Nomads layer deep dub sonics over hard beats. 10 p.m., BPM, 237 Kent Avenue, between Grand and North First Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (no phone); $8. (Sinagra)    FIELD MUSIC (Tomorrow) One of the new British bands, Field Music sounds like a poppier version of the neo-post-punk garage music in vogue of late. 11:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE (Tomorrow) Still underappreciated even after the 2002 fluke MTV smash hit ''Stacey's Mom,'' these 30-something New York City songwriters continue to write some of the best pure pop ditties and smartest yuppie satires around. 8:30 p.m., Allen Room at Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800;$30 to $55. (Sinagra)    ELY GUERRA (Wednesday) Ely Guerra is one of the most intriguing songwriters in Mexican rock. Ms. Guerra sings about passion: gazing at it from a distance, then plunging into the turbulence. Her songs incorporate rock, funk, electronica and the torchy emotion of Mexican pop in a shifting balance of poise and obsession. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940 or (718) 965-9177; $18 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)    ISAAC HAYES (Thursday) Isaac Hayes helped shape the Memphis sound at Stax in the 60's, capturing the churning urban agitation of the 70's with his funky ''Shaft'' soundtrack; he continues to contribute to current R & B projects. 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, $37.50 in advance, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)    BILLY JOEL (Thursday) The iconic piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado, in both his playing and his delivery, that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 (sold out) to $89.50. (Sinagra)    LEZ ZEPPELIN (Tonight) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy. Of course, they also have their gender-bending way with macho metaphors about squeezed lemons and dripping honey. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)    JONI MITCHELL TRIBUTE (Wednesday) This tantalizingly diverse tribute to the folk-rock songwriter Joni Mitchell, a benefit for the Music for Youth Foundation, includes artists ranging from Bebel Gilberto and Bettye LaVette to the Eels and Joseph Arthur. 8 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $225. (Sinagra)    MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME, SHARON JONES AND THE DAP KINGS (Tomorrow) Minneapolis's ''Jungle Love'' hit makers are still pumping their keyboard-based grooves, with the dapperly overdone Morris Day out front and his trusty ''valet'' Jerome Benton by his side. The stirring singer Sharon Jones coaxes joy and pain while the Dap Kings supply 60's soul grooves. 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $35. (Sinagra)    THE NATIONAL, CAGE, CELEBRATION, BEANS (Thursday) The National is a group of New York-based Ohio natives who turn out a kind of pent-up, countrified indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. A longtime fixture on the indie rap scene, Cage often recalls his fractured childhood and rough upbringing. Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. The rapid-fire rapper Beans is also on the bill. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sinagra)    THE PLASTIC CONSTELLATIONS (Tuesday) The Minneapolis rockers the Plastic Constellations play exuberant, metal-infused emo with vocals that harken back to shouty bands like Fugazi and At the Drive In. 6:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door.(Sinagra)    RAKIM (Monday) One of hip-hop's most commading MC's, Rakim did his best work with DJ Eric B. in the late 80's and early 90's, but his cool, confident flow is still one to beat. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, $30 in advance, $35 at the door.

(Pareles)    WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY (Tonight) This cacophonous indie collective creates a kind of industrial mazurka fanfare. 11:30, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden)    Andrea Marcovicci (Tonight and tomorrow night) In her spellbinding retrospective ''I'll Be Seeing You  Love Songs of World War II,'' Ms. Marcovicci balances nostalgia for songs associated with ''the good war'' with acknowledgment of the real pain and sacrifice that inspired so many of them, providing a dusting of reality. 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $65 cover, with a required $60 prix-fixe dinner at the early shows; $20 minimum required for the late shows.

(Holden)    * ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, Ms. Stritch weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue about her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $125; dinner, required, is served at 6:30; sold out.

The Great Tradition of the Latin Bass,'' with Andy Gonzalez, John Benitez and Charnett Moffett as guest bassists; the evening's star will be Israel Cachao Lopez, who, at 87, is probably the most influential Latin bass player of all time. 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $105.50 and $135.50.

(Chinen)    BRUCE BARTH TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a pianist, Mr. Barth prefers subtlety and fluency over any kind of flash; his trio, with the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Montez Coleman, performs original compositions alongside music by Thelonious Monk and, less predictably, the Grateful Dead. 9 and 11 p.m., and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Anne Midgette)    'COSÌ FAN TUTTE' (Tomorrow) This is the ultimate ensemble opera and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production this fall was an impressive effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. ''Così'' has returned this month, with all but two members of that cast. The bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties takes the place of Barbara Frittoli as Fiordiligi. The engaging mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena again sings her sister, Dorabella.

(Tommasini)    'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight and Monday) Back after its winter break, the Metropolitan Opera was still working out the vacation kinks at its first production of Julie Taymor's pageant of a ''Die Zauberflöte,'' and its cast of young Americans was not uniformly up to speed.

(Dunning)    TANGO, HISTORIAS BREVES: GUILLERMINA QUIROGA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Quiroga, whose credits include Tango x2, Forever Tango and Tango Argentino, uses tango to explore mysteries both divine and human. 8, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484 or www.skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $35 to $45.

(Kinetz)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,'  through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)    International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)    * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what Latino art means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter)    ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)    * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)    The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through April 16. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray, and artworks in various media relating to chess by Dorothea Tanning, Alberto Giacometti and John Cage, whose chessboard incorporates musical notation for a piano composition that you can hear on headphones. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Ken Johnson)    * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. through Feb. 19.(Johnson)    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter)    Galleries: 57th Street    * 'Constructing Realities' See this conceptually ambitious exhibition for Andy Warhol's amazing, rarely seen 1965 film of an 83-year-old performer named Paul Swan who dances and recites poetry in exotic, Middle Eastern-style costumes with wonderfully un-self-conscious verve. A one-act play on video by Mike Kelley; videos transmitted from cell-phones for a project by Robert Whitman; a multiscreen video portrait of a man by Gary Hill; Stan Douglas's well-known film ''Der Sandemann''; and a selection of classic Diane Arbus photographs round out the show. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3293, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter)    Galleries: Chelsea    Jóhannes Atli Hinriksson: 'Mutiny' This young artist from Iceland makes intermittently funny, tedious, visually gripping and absurdly violent horror videos using small, clumsily cobbled-together puppets and sets. Featuring much spurting fake blood and other liquids, they could be the works of Napoleon Dynamite's demented cousin. Haswellediger, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 206-8955, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    * Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 223-2227, through Feb. 11. (Johnson)    Florian Maier-Aichen A German photographer who lives part of the time in Los Angeles and will appear in this year's Whitney Biennial, Mr. Maier-Aichen makes large landscapes in which the convergence of natural imagery and photographic and digital technologies confounds the supposed transparency of photography. His ideas are not new, but the best pictures, including distant nighttime views of Los Angeles and a red-toned aerial picture of mountains, are sumptuous and subtly surrealistic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)    Tim Roda A Boschian madness seems to have descended upon the young family of three featured in grainy, low-tech black-and-white photographs staged by the father, 28 year-old Mr. Roda, in old barns and dank industrial spaces. Grotesque prosthetic limbs, Freudian visual puns, foolish ceremonies, cross-dressing and moods of dour absurdity and cosmic mystery recur in these comical and creepy, dreamlike tableaus. Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-9494, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Feb. 11. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    Kim Levin: 'Notes and Itineraries, 1976 - 2004' The longtime art critic for The Village Voice is the subject of a fascinating retrospective that views her career, as well as the history of the New York art scene, through the lens of ephemera that she has accumulated over the past 25 years, including postcard announcements, news releases and handwritten exhibition lists. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984'  The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck)    Brian DEwan and Leon DEwan: 'Dewanatron' Electronic musicians, eccentric inventors, sculptors and cousins, the Dewans create electronic sound-making machines housed in wall-mounted wooden containers that look like props for old sci-fi movies, or creations of a domestic hobbyist. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144, through Jan 31. (Johnson)    * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson)    'Humanitarians Not Heroes (Five-Alive)' This show presents offbeat promotional objects designed by various artists and issued by the exhibition's curator, the conceptualist Trong G. Nguyen, under the aegis of his own five-year-old organization called Humanitarians Not Heroes. They include ''Sound Capsule,'' a CD not to be played until a certain date in the future; T-shirts printed with birth and death dates of unspecified people; and fortune cookies containing sayings of George W. Bush. Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 645-2800, through Thursday.(Johnson)    'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson)    Last Chance    OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of the American Modernists active between World Wars I and II. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, Manhattan, (212) 570-4190; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, closes tomorrowthrough Jan. 28. (Smith)    Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-4774; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    * Met: 'FRA ANGELICO,'  An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710; closes Sunday. (Smith)    * Guillaume Pinard: 'expresso' Surrealistic, darkly comical black ball-point pen drawings evoke a childlike mind under the influence of Gumby, the Muppets and Japanese anime, and an animated video follows the adventures of two eyeballs with arms and legs through shape-shifting landscapes. Team, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    * JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000; closes tomorrow.

Opens Monday. A comedy about a woman having a terrible day -- that is, before she moves into a new apartment -- by Jeff Daniels, who personified Park Slope pretentiousness in ''The Squid and the Whale'' (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255.    'ZOMBOID!' Opens Wednesday. Richard Foreman, a downtown institution, tries multimedia in his latest experimental event, which features large projections shot in Australia (1:15).

Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200.    'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' Opens Feb. 14. Mr. Darcy becomes Marcy in this gender-switching musical retelling of ''Pride and Prejudice,'' which stars Stephane D'Abruzzo from ''Avenue Q'' (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village; (212) 307-4100.    'THE PAJAMA GAME' Opens Feb. 23.

New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Tuesday, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)      * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'ALMOST, MAINE'  John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER'  A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION'  An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'ANTON' It is one thing to write a play about Anton Chekhov's last four years, quite another to attempt the master's style, then produce and direct it and portray the title character. Though Pierre van der Spuy's reach far exceeds his grasp, he deserves some credit for trying (2:15). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, between Charlton and Vandam Streets, South Village; (212) 352-3101.(Andrea Stevens)    *'THE END OF REALITY' Violence isn't pretty in the listless but eventful world of Richard Maxwell's hypnotic new play. It's not ugly, either. In this latest work from the king of affecting disaffection, violence doesn't so much explode as drip, like water from a leaky faucet, into the lives of lonely, hapless security guards. Mr. Maxwell's most eloquent statement to date about the blurring of despair and apathy in American lives (1:40). The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793. (Brantley)    'GONER' The president is shot, and the world's worst doctors get the job of trying to save him in this very funny bit of sketch comedy disguised as a play. Bad taste seems not to be an issue for the author, Brian Parks, but most of the lunacy is inspired enough that you can forgive the insensitivity (1:15). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'HOUSE OF DESIRE' This 300-year-old farce, written by a nun, mostly proves that Baroque women were just as capable as Baroque men of producing forgettable plays. It's sometimes fun watching the energetic young actors trying to breathe life into it, though, especially during a smashing sword fight conducted in semi-darkness (2:10). Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'MAJOR BARBARA' George Bernard Shaw's polemic against the military-industrial complex and organized religion is still timely 100 years later, and though the director Brooke O'Harra's Kabuki-tinged version lands on the mark and misses it about equally, there is something true and real about the production that is worth seeing (2:35). La MaMa Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710. (Stevens)    'WHAT THEN' Even if Rinne Groff's playful play about environmental disaster is occasionally labored, there's never any doubt that there's an active, lively intelligence at work (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)    * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)    * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)    'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE'  (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)    'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)    'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true-story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western college bastkeball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee)    'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee)    * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)    'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis)    * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)    'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)    'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)    * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'TRISTAN & ISOLDE' (PG-13, 125 minutes) The lovers of Celtic mythology, Arthurian legend and Wagnerian libretto fall for each other far from the violent, Dark Ages machinations plaguing their two warring peoples. A pleasant entertainment from the director Kevin Reynolds that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more. (Dargis)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    * 'WHEN THE SEA RISES' (No rating, 89 minutes, in French) Graced with a magnetic lead performance by Yolande Moreau, this French-Belgian movie is a serious romantic comedy with surreal touches that follows the road tour of a middle-aged solo comedian through the small towns of northern France.(Holden)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    Film Series    FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Feb. 12) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. This weekend's films are ''Kundun'' (1997), Martin Scorsese's biography of the 14th Dalai Lama, selected by Nathan Lee, who reviews movies for The New York Times, and ''Foreign Correspondent'' (1940), Hitchcock's espionage thriller starring Joel McCrea and Laraine Day, selected by Andrew Sarris. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.

CYRO BAPTISTA & BEAT THE DONKEY, LUMINESCENT ORCHESTRII (Tomorrow) Led by the percussionist Cyro Baptista, who has collaborated on some of the world-beat forays of Paul Simon and Sting, the ensemble Beat the Donkey plays ecumenical music with a Brazilian flavor, integrating samba, forró and maracatu as well as jazz, rock and funk. Luminescent Orchestrii makes similar cultural mash-ups with a Balkan base. 8 p.m., Steinhardt Building, Makor, 35 West 67th Street, (212) 415-5500; $15. (Laura Sinagra)    BELL ORCHESTRE, CLOGS (Sunday) The Montreal band the Bell Orchestre mixes traditional orchestral sounds with machine atmospherics. In contemplative moments, its music recalls the Tindersticks' work for film, although it is sometimes more stately. Like-minded associates Clogs also play. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Thursday) This Canadian collective makes heartbreak music that sounds like a fuzzy, drunken party. Some prefer its diffuse anthemic feints to the straight-up anthems of its countrymen Arcade Fire. Members have included the Stars' Evan Cranley, Metric's Emily Haines and the multitalented singer-songwriter Leslie Feist. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25. (Sinagra)    CAKE, TEGAN AND SARA, GOGOL BORDELLO, EUGENE MIRMAN (Tonight) The Sacramento-based alt-rock band Cake uses its Unlimited Sunshine Tour as a chance to perform with musicians its members admire. This time out they asked the Canadian folk-pop twins Tegan and Sara, as well as the manic Gypsy punkers Gogol Bordello. The music-loving hipster comedian Eugene Mirman will tie it all together. 7:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212) 485-1534; $34. (Sinagra)    CALEXICO (Tuesday) Calexico plays desert rock bathed in pedal-steel mystery and orchestral ambience. Lately the group has collaborated with the quiescent folk-rocker Iron and Wine (a k a Sam Beam), striking a balance that made it sound more intimate and him more expansive. The group plays without him this weekend but is joined by the multi-instrumentalist Rob Burger. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20.

Tonight at 8, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door (sold out). Tomorrow at 11 p.m., the Annex, 152 Orchard Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side; $10 (sold out). (Sinagra)    ELEPHANT MAN (Tonight) Nicknamed Energy God, the Jamaican D.J. Elephant Man has been one of the dancehall artists most successful in terms of crossing over to the hip-hop scene, lending his gruff, kinetic voice to so many rap and R&B tracks that at times it has felt like overkill. He appears here at a party put on by Hot 97's Angie Martinez and DJ Enuff. 9 p.m., Exit, 610 West 56th Street; free to all on guest list before midnight, $25 after. Call (212) 582-8282 for details.

(Sinagra)    BILLY JOEL (Monday and Thursday) The iconic piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50. (Sinagra)    HOWARD JONES (Monday) The 80's synth-pop hitmaker behind the giddily uplifting ''New Song'' and the vaguely spooky rouser ''Things Can Only Get Better'' scored big by being more human than Thomas Dolby and more optimistic than the Fixx. 7 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $25. (Sinagra)    KARSH KALE & REALIZE LIVE FEATURING VISHAL VAID, GLOBESONIC SOUND SYSTEM (Tonight) The tabla player Karsh Kale has branched out into production, exploring East-meets-West beat culture. The vocalist and harmonium player Vishal Vaid draws his inspiration from South Asian ghazal, modally sung improvisatory love poetry. Globesonic Sound System spins a dance party at 12:30. 9, Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $18. (Sinagra)    CURT KIRKWOOD (Tonight) In the Meat Puppets, the 80's band he led with his brother Cris, Curt Kirkwood proved himself a punk guitar mystic, integrating punk and classic rock with a lolling profundity revered by Kurt Cobain. 11 p.m., the Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; $10. (Sinagra)    LANGHORNE SLIM (Tonight) With an old-timey shtick and indie-rock influences, this urban-folk songwriter helps young scenesters cleanse the sonic palette after too many nights of beeps and blare. 11:30, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra)    COLIN MELOY AND LAURA VEIRS (Thursday) The sharp-voiced frontman of the Decemberists, Colin Meloy will soon release some of his college band Tarkio's material, the strength of which proves he's always been a master tunesmith inclined toward earnest literary name-checking. He plays solo this time, sharing the bill with another evocative songwriter, the ethereal but edgy Laura Veirs. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536; $23.50. (Sinagra)    MF DOOM, LITTLE BROTHER (Thursday) MF Doom is a purveyor of imaginative raps that glower and shimmer, creating a sense of poetic pain. Little Brother is a soul-grounded rap group from Durham, N.C., that forgoes Southern crunk in favor of blending the free-form experimentation of OutKast with the kind of jazzy tracks that characterized the East Coast hip-hop of the mid-90's. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $33. (Sinagra)    THE MOONEY SUZUKI, ABERDEEN CITY (Wednesday) The bluesy garage-rockers the Mooney Suzuki play this open-bar party on a bill that also includes the art-pop hopefuls Aberdeen City. 9 p.m., Shindig Party, 60 Gansevoort Street, near Washington Street, Meatpacking District, shindignyc.com; $15. (Sinagra)    R. STEVIE MOORE, ODAWAS (Tonight) The rarely seen R. Stevie Moore plays denatured California-flavored pop. Odawas makes arty folk-rock that sounds as if it's being strummed at a campfire on a desert moon, against the baying of mechanical wolves. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra)    THE ROLLING STONES, METRIC (Tonight) The Stones' newest album is their most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages, the Stones even seem politically relevant. Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Haines, Metric finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Haines's shuddering alto functions as both a weapon and a come-on. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra)    LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tonight) Led by the singers Allyssa Lamb and Emily Hurst, this band mixes musicians from the United States, France and Colombia, who mine their Latin heritage in the performance of boleros, cha-chas, cumbias, huaynos and cowboy songs. 11, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $10.

Its songs touch down variously in down-tempo Sade territory, pop-flamenco, reggae, trance, drum-and-bass and various Latin hybrids. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $18 Advance, $20 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    RICKY SKAGGS & KENTUCKY THUNDER (Sunday) Ricky Skaggs's fingers fly over just about anything with frets, especially the mandolin; he's no slouch on the fiddle, either, and he has the high tenor voice of a singer steeped in bluegrass. He did well in the Nashville mainstream in the 1980's, working as a producer and making a hit on his own with ''Country Boy'' in 1984. He has recently returned to more traditional Southern gospel and bluegrass. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35.

(Sinagra)    LEWIS TAYLOR (Thursday) To call the British songwriter Lewis Taylor neo-soul is to shortchange an arduous history. He has been recording throwback psych-soul odes to love and pain since the 80's, with far less recognition than he is entitled to. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)    THREE FLOORS OF SKA (Tonight) Tonight the Knitting Factory is filled with ska bands of many persuasions, from the Toasters, the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble, Go Jimmy Go and Eastern Standard Time to the Rotterdam Ska Jazz Foundation, the Bluebeats, the Rudie Crew, Hub City, Bigger Thomas, Bombtown and the Vicars. 7 , 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $17 in advance, $20 at the door.

(Pareles)    WE ARE SCIENTISTS, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Tonight) The pointy guitars and firecracker drums of this local band propel the tremulous pleas of Keith Murray into a full-on lust panic. Where similar bands can sound too studied, We Are Scientists makes its precision seem inspired. The trio Oxford Collapse's shaggy art-rock recalls that of acerbic forebears like the Embarrassment. 9, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10 in advance, $12 at the door (sold out).

(Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden)    ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum.

(Holden)    * ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday through Thursday) Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, Ms. Stritch weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue about her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $125; dinner, required, is served at 6:30. (Holden)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    MICHAËL ATTIAS AND RENKU + 2 (Monday) As on the recent album ''Renku'' (Playscape), the saxophonist Michaël Attias embellishes compositional miniatures with help from the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Satoshi Takeishi. For this engagement, they're joined by Tony Malaby on saxophone, and Russ Lossing on Fender Rhodes piano. 10 p.m. and midnight, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)    MATT BREWER QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) The bassist Matt Brewer has lately distinguished himself in a handful of sideman settings; leading his own group here, he features the tenor saxophonist Chris Cheek, the pianist Frank LoCrasto and the drummer Rodney Green. 10, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $15. (Chinen)    HENRY BUTLER (Tonight) New Orleans has turned out more than a few great jazz pianists, Mr. Butler among them; this solo concert should be a good showcase for his style, powerfully and persuasively rooted in the blues. 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $45. (Chinen)    DON BYRON'S IVEY-DIVEY (Monday) This trio -- Mr. Byron on clarinet and tenor saxophone, Jason Moran on piano, and Billy Hart on drums -- pays homage, directly and obliquely, to a 1946 recording session featuring Lester Young, Nat King Cole and Buddy Rich. Results range from the sparsely poetic to the blusteringly emphatic, but the group's imaginative energies never ebb. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25. (Chinen)    ROY CAMPBELL'S PYRAMID TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Campbell, a trumpeter ensconced in free-jazz circles, uses this group to engage in improvisation from the perspective of global folk culture; he has the ideal collaborators in William Parker, on bass and assorted wind instruments, and Hamid Drake, on drums and percussion. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    BILL CHARLAP TRIO (Wednesday through Jan. 29) Bright and breezy yet unfailingly precise, Mr. Charlap, the pianist, has come to exemplify jazz's modern mainstream. So has his working trio, which keeps a Tin Pan Alley repertory percolating in the present tense. 8 and 10 p.m. with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50 and $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    ANDREW D'ANGELO'S I WILL SURVIVE (Tonight) Mr. D'Angelo, an expressive and often entertainingly frenetic multi-reedist, joins forces with the Norwegian tenor saxophonist Kjetil Moster, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Jim Black. 9 and 10:30, Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762; no cover. (Chinen)    E.S.T. (Through Sunday) The initials stand for Esbjörn Svensson Trio, a popular acoustic jazz-crossover group from Sweden; taking its lead from Mr. Svensson's piano, the ensemble favors somber harmonies and skittering electronic textures. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)    * HENRY GRIMES AND ROSWELL RUDD (Tomorrow) The bassist Henry Grimes and the trombonist Roswell Rudd were fellow travelers in jazz's 1960's avant-garde, though they followed separate career paths in the ensuing years, Mr. Rudd plunging into obscurity (in the Catskills) and Mr. Grimes into oblivion (in California). Both have been back on the scene and making up for lost time; this duo engagement should evoke some historical echoes but resist the tug of nostalgia. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $20 each set; $35 for both sets. (Chinen)    CURTIS HASSELBRING'S BTH (Wednesday) Mr. Hasselbring, a trombonist and guitarist with a mischievous sense of humor, introduces a promising ensemble with a typically inscrutable title; his bandmates are Shane Endsley on trumpet, Andrew D'Angelo on alto saxophone, Trevor Dunn on bass and Ches Smith on drums. 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    * DAVE HOLLAND FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) Closing out a weeklong club engagement, Mr. Holland introduces a new sextet, with the trumpeter Alex Sipiagin, the alto saxophonist Antonio Hart, the trombonist Robin Eubanks, the pianist Mulgrew Miller and the drummer Eric Harland (tonight and tomorrow) and a standards-oriented duo with the vibraphonist Steve Nelson (Sunday). 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    * THE JABANE ENSEMBLE (Tuesday and Wednesday) Like the Robert Glasper Experiment, which features the piano playing of Mr. Glasper and the drumming of Chris Dave, this young ensemble, presented by the producer Jill Newman, draws from rhythm and blues, gospel and hip-hop; along with Mr. Glasper and Mr. Dave, its members are the guitarist Lionel Loueke, the harmonica player Gregoire Maret and the bassist Derrick Hodge. The silk-toned singer Bilal and the trumpeter Roy Hargrove will alternate as special guests. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $25 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $15 at the bar, and a one-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    * STEVE LEHMAN (Wednesday and Thursday) Celebrating the release of ''Demian as Posthuman'' (Pi), his bracing and fiercely imagined new album, the saxophonist Steve Lehman performs in three overlapping ensembles: his Blueprint Trio, with the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Eric McPherson; a duo with the drummer Tyshawn Sorey; and a quintet featuring Mr. Brewer and Mr. Sorey alongside Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet and Mike Moreno on guitar. 9 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15, members, $10. (Chinen)    MULGREW MILLER AND WINGSPAN (Tuesday through January 29) Mr. Miller is a pianist with roots firmly planted in jazz tradition, especially the blues; but his ensemble Wingspan pursues a distinctly airy sensibility, with help from the saxophonist Steve Wilson, the trumpeter Duane Eubanks and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    * NYC WINTER JAZZFEST (Sunday) This six-hour smorgasbord, produced by Brice Rosenbloom, purposefully coincides with this week's Association of Performing Arts Presenters conference. Occupying all three floors of the Knitting Factory, it showcases almost 20 groups; highlights include Me'shell N'degeocello's Spirit Music Jamia, Marc Ribot's Spiritual Unity, the Dave Burrell Trio, Rez Abbasi's Snake Charmer and Terence Blanchard's Flow. 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; cover, $25.(Chinen)    WILLIAM PARKER (Tuesday through next Saturday) Mr. Parker is a pillar, musically and morally, of modern avant-garde jazz culture; he leads three different ensembles in three days next week, beginning with a quartet with the alto saxophonist Rob Brown, the trumpeter Lewis Barnes and the drummer Hamid Drake (on Tuesday), moving on to a trio with Mr. Drake and the multi-instrumentalist Daniel Carter (Wednesday) on Thursday and Friday with the quintet from his recent album ''Raining on the Moon'' (Thirsty Ear) and concluding next Saturday with a program including poetry and dance. Tuesday and next Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m., Wednesday through next Friday at 10 p.m. , the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    DAFNIS PRIETO QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto, an essential fixture on New York's Latin-jazz scene, has gradually been establishing his reputation as a composer; his cohesive band includes Manuel Valera on piano, Yosvany Terry on saxophone and his brother Junior Terry on bass. This concert, presented by the Williamsburg Jazz Festival, also features a prelude (the guitarist Gerry Eastman, at 9 p.m.) and a postscript (a late-night jam session, led by Mr. Eastman). 10:30 p.m., Williamsburg Music Center, 367 Bedford Avenue, at South Fifth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 384-1654, www.wjazzfestival.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    LUCIANA SOUZA QUARTET AND BRAZILIAN DUOS (Monday) Ms. Souza, an exceptional singer originally from São Paolo, divides her attention between these two ensemble settings, rarely presenting them in tandem. Her quartet interprets jazz standards as well as poems by Pablo Neruda, Elizabeth Bishop and others (with music composed by Ms. Souza); her Brazilian Duos project showcases an intimate and highly intelligent dialogue with Romero Lubambo, another transplanted Brazilian, on acoustic guitar. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    TONE COLLECTOR (Sunday) The tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Jeff Davis make up this experimental acoustic threesome, which released a bristling debut last year on Norway's Jazzaway label; they're joined here by a fellow traveler, Ben Gerstein, on trombone. 8 and 9:30 p.m., BAR4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; cover, $5.(Chinen)    JEFF (TAIN) WATTS SHOW (Through Sunday) Mr. Watts, a drummer whose locomotive drive is matched only by his attunement to the dynamics of a group, leads one consisting of the tenor saxophonist Marcus Strickland, the pianist Lawrence Fields and the bassist Eric Revis. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    MIGUEL ZENÓN QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Jíbaro'' (Marsalis Music), Mr. Zenón's last album, affirmed this alto saxophonist's credentials as a young composer with vision; his quartet includes Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Henry Cole on drums. 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15, members, $10. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'AINADAMAR' (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) The exuberant, genre-bending music of the Argentinean-born composer Osvaldo Golijov is the focus of a monthlong festival at Lincoln Center. It starts this week with the New York premiere of his lushly scored flamenco opera ''Ainadamar'' (''Fountain of Tears''), loosely based on the life and legacy of the Spanish writer Federico García Lorca. Peter Sellars directs the production, with Dawn Upshaw, Kelley O'Connor and Jessica Rivera in the principal roles. Miguel Harth-Bedoya conducts. Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65. (Jeremy Eichler)    'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' (Thursday) Vincent La Selva can either break your heart or make you want to wring his neck: why on earth is a conductor this good, of a certain age, conducting a free performance at an Upper West Side church rather than at the Met? Well, whatever the reason (and there are reasons), lovers of Verdi can go hear him and his cast of little-knowns -- often surprisingly good -- with relish. 7:30 p.m., Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, West End Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 245-8837. (Anne Midgette)    Bronx Opera (Tomorrow, Sunday) There are some -- O.K., maybe it's just me -- who consider Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' the perfect opera: a wrenching story, spectacular vocal and ensemble music, and it all clocks in at about 50 minutes. The enterprising Bronx Opera has paired this story of royal passion and supernatural mischief with Chabrier's ''Incomplete Education,'' a light piece about a young newlywed's search for information on how to proceed. 2 p.m., Heckscher Theater, El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (718) 960-8833; $20 to $35. (Allan Kozinn)    'COSÌ FAN TUTTE' (Wednesday) This is the ultimate ensemble opera, and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production this fall was an impressive effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. ''Così'' returns with that cast almost intact. The bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties takes the place of Barbara Frittoli as Fiordiligi. The engaging mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena again sings her sister Dorabella. The lyric tenor Paul Groves (taking the place of Matthew Polenzani) and the robust baritone Mariusz Kwiecien portray the young men who cruelly test the fidelity of the two sisters. The veteran baritone Thomas Allen sings the jaded bachelor Don Alfonso. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)    'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Thursday) Franco Alfano's almost-forgotten ''Cyrano'' is musically not much of an opera. But this 1936 work does provide a meaty role for the ageless tenor Plácido Domingo, who gave a vocally fervent and poignant portrayal of Cyrano, the fearless and noble guardsman cursed with an absurdly huge nose, when the production was introduced last season. It returns for six performances, with Mr. Domingo and a strong cast starting Thursday night. Francesca Zambello's production is stylish, handsome and effective. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini)    'DESPERATELY SEEKING THAÏS' (Thursday) This conceptual take on Massenet's ''Thaïs'' is worth a look if only to check out the silent film, with the golden-age soprano Mary Garden, that will run along with the live musical excerpts provided by the latest incarnation of L'Opéra Français de New York. 8 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $25. (Midgette)    'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tomorrrow and Tuesday) The Met seems to have a big hit on its hands with Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's fairy-tale opera, which opened last season. But the production is so packed with nonstop stage effects and so peopled with dancers, extras, gargantuan puppets and kitelike animals of every sort that during last season's presentations, the fine musical performances by the conductor James Levine, the Met orchestra and the strong cast took a back seat to the stage show. Maybe the new conductor, Paul Daniel, and the promising new cast that takes over when the production returns tomorrow afternoon (including Mary Dunleavy as Pamina, Eric Cutler as Tamino and Nathan Gunn as Papageno) will fare better. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow; $21 to $80 on Tuesday, with limited tickets. (Tommasini)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) This floating concert hall on the Brooklyn side of the East River offers the intimacy that chamber music needs, as well as a wonderful view of Lower Manhattan through the bay windows behind stage. This weekend the Fine Arts Quartet offers installments of a Shostakovich string quartet cycle -- Nos. 4, 11 and 14 tonight, Nos. 1, 5 and 8 tomorrow and Sunday. Patrycja Piekutowska, a violinist, and Jonahan Yates, a pianist, take over on Thursday with a program of contemporary Polish music, including works by Krzysztof Penderecki, Grazyna Bacewicz, Szymanowski and Lutoslawski.

(Kozinn)    BERLIN PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday, Thursday) Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliners return to New York with a four-concert series that runs through Jan. 28. Typically one of the highlights of the Carnegie Hall season, this outstanding orchestra gets rolling on Wednesday with Haydn (Symphony No. 86), Schoenberg (Variations for Orchestra) and Strauss (''Ein Heldenleben''). Thursday's program features Mahler's Fourth, with the mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena and the New York premiere of Hanspeter Kyburz's ''Noesis.'' 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $58 to $195. (Eichler)    BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Conductors looking for a leg up in their careers have founded orchestras before, but even Ivan Fischer could hardly have imagined that both he and the Budapest Festival Orchestra would have risen so well together. This year's Carnegie Hall appearance for the orchestra is part of the pianist Richard Goode's ''Perspectives'' series, and Mr. Goode will join the orchestra for Bartok's Third Concerto. 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $74. (Midgette)    CASSATT STRING QUARTET (Sunday) A striking Eastern European program includes the nocturne from Borodin's second quartet, Dvorak's Quartet in A flat and a piano quintet by the 19th-century Polish composer and pianist Juliusz Zarebski, for which they will be joined by Roman Markowicz. 3 p.m., Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 734-2130; $25; $20 for students and 65+. (Midgette)    'CHAMBERFEST' (Tonight and tomorrow night) You might think that the Juilliard School has enough to handle with its ambitious continuing musical celebration of its 100th anniversary, not to mention the annual ''Focus'' festival, coming up at the end of the month. But this week the school has also been presenting ''Chamberfest,'' a series of free concerts of diverse works performed by accomplished student musicians. The series ends with concerts tonight (works by Bartok, Schoenberg and Brahms's stormy Piano Quintet in F minor) and tomorrow night (Copland's ''Appalachian Spring,'' Berg's String Quartet and Messiaen's mystical ''Quartet for the End of Time.'') 8, Paul Hall, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406. (Tommasini)    COMPOSER PORTRAIT: BONGANI NDODANA (Tonight) The adventurous Miller Theater begins a three-day ''Focus on Africa'' series with a concert featuring works by Bongani Ndodana. Born in Queenstown in 1975, Mr. Ndodana is considered the most prominent young South African composer working today. His works draw both from traditional African and contemporary classical heritages. The soprano Dawn Padmore and the African Exchanges Ensemble will perform, conducted by the composer. 8, Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20. (Tommasini)    GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri soldiers through another season as the de facto quartet-in-residence at the Metropolitan Museum. Each of the group's six concerts features a Mozart quartet, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Flute Quartet (K. 285), with Carol Wincenc, as well as Schumann's String Quartet No. 3 and Richard Danielpour's String Quartet No. 5. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler)    HOUSTON SYMPHONY (Tuesday) The noted soprano Barbara Bonney joins the Houston Symphony under Hans Graf for a program of Mozart, Shostakovich and the Houston composer Pierre Jalbert. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $87. (Eichler)    DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY (Wednesday) The great silver-maned Russian baritone offers a program of works from his homeland, with opera arias by Borodin, Rachmaninoff and Rubinstein alongside 20th-century popular songs. Supporting him are the Philharmonia of Russia, conducted by Constantine Orbelian; the Cathedral Choral Society; and Style of Five, a Russian folk ensemble. For the perplexed, a preconcert lecture by Maya Pritsker should sort it all out. 8 p.m. (lecture at 6:45), Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $60. (Kozinn)    JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) Now that Leonard Slatkin has stepped aside for medical reasons, James DePreist will conduct the student orchestra in Shostakovich's ''Leningrad'' Symphony, as well as in music by two former Juilliard presidents: William Schuman and Peter Mennin. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $10 to $20; free tickets for students and 65+. (Eichler)    NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday) This year's winter festival is devoted to Mozart -- not surprisingly, given that this year marks the 250th anniversary of his birth and is glutted with Mozart concerts. The second program of the three-week ''Many Faces of Mozart'' event is called ''Mozart and the Voice,'' and includes excerpts from ''The Magic Flute'' and the Requiem. Bernard Labadie conducts. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 3 p.m. at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark; tomorrow night at 8, War Memorial, Memorial Drive, Trenton, (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75. (Midgette)    NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS (Tomorrow) Harold Rosenbaum's finely polished chorus specializes in contemporary music, and turns its attention this time to composers who either worked in or were influenced by Minimalism. Included are choral scores by John Adams, David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Michael Gordon, Jeffrey Schanzer and Steve Martland. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Kozinn)    ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE  (Sunday and Monday) Sir John Eliot Gardiner and his fine period-instrument orchestra contribute two concerts to this year's Mozart celebration. On Sunday, the Monteverdi Choir joins the ensemble for two great liturgical works that Mozart left unfinished: the Mass in C minor (performed here in the Alois Schmitt edition, touched up by Sir John), and the Requiem. On Monday, the orchestra plays Mozart's three final symphonies, Nos. 39, 40 and 41. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; $35 to $69. Monday at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; $56; (212) 721-6500. (Kozinn)    RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Tomorrow) The composer Anthony Korf and the conductor George Rothman, who founded this innovative orchestra, have championed several inexplicably overlooked 20th-century composers. One is the Romanian-born Frenchman Marius Constant, who died in 2004. Constant is probably fated to be remembered best as the composer of the theme for ''The Twilight Zone.'' But he has a large catalog of strong symphonic works, ballet scores and chamber music. The Riverside will perform his ''103 Regards Dans l'Eau'' on an all-French program with works by Rameau, Ravel and Poulenc. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 and $45. (Tommasini)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * 'ARISTOPHANES IN BIRDONIA' (Tonight though Sunday night) David Gordon, Valda Setterfield and their Pick Up Performance Company made a big splash two years ago with ''Dancing Henry V'' (reprised last March), and now they are back at St. Mark's Church with another dance-theater piece inspired by a classic drama, in this case ''The Birds.'' Ms. Setterfield plays the playwright, and expect pointed references to contemporary events. 8:30, Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $20.

(Dunning)    EMIO GRECO/PC (Tonight through Sunday) This Netherlands-based company is run by the Italian choreographer Emio Greco and the Dutch theater director Pieter C. Scholten. Their ''Conjunto di Nero'' is a full-evening work for six dancers who are, according to the publicity materials, ''dressed in woolly black garments.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $38.(Sulcas)    SARA EAST JOHNSON AND LAVA (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Ms. Johnson's award-winning, all-women company, LAVA, presents ''(w)HOLE'' (short for ''The Whole History of Life on Earth''), its first new work since 2003. Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve. (Through Feb. 19.) Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7; Sunday at 5 p.m.; Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25.

(La Rocco)    MOVING MEN (Tuesday) It will be raining men at Dixon Place when the Bronx sensation Arthur Aviles organizes an evening of dance featuring Tom Pearson, Carlo Quispe, Raymond, and Pavel Zustiak. 8 p.m., 258 Bowery, second floor, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736; $10 to $12. (La Rocco)    BEN MUNISTERI DANCE PROJECTS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Munisteri was one of the most compelling of Doug Elkins's performers many years ago; now he makes dances that match his unpredictable, frisky stage presence. You also have to appreciate the range of his musical tastes: A new work, ''Tuesday, 4 a.m. and other dances,'' is set to Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra, while the older ''Turbine Mines'' is set to the ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack. 10 tonight and 7:30 tomorrow night, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 9224-0077; $25; $15 for students, 65+ or artists.

(Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,'  through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)    International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (Cotter)    * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck)    * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Johnson)    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter)    School Zone Martinez Gallery isn't a place; it's a collaborative network of several graffiti artists, two architect-designers, a curator and a dealer. The gallery has taken its graffiti star artists into a public high school for this show, for which, with the help of students, they've covered the walls and ceilings of a classroom with art, alternately brash and delicate, exclamatory and introspective. Martinez Gallery at Julia Richman High School, 317 East 67th Street, Room 222, (212) 619-2149, through Jan. 28 (Cotter)    * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    * Katy Grannan: 'Mystic Lake' Ms. Grannan continues to make exceptionally intimate photographs of nonprofessional models posing outdoors partly or fully unclothed. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Douglas Anderson: 'New Old Robots' Painted in grayed colors and a brushy, cartoonish style that recalls the Ash Can School and 1930's-era Social Realism, Mr. Anderson's comical and mournful small paintings depict old shoes, plumbing, brick walls, junk cars and outmoded industrial machinery in states of dreamlike animation. Blue Mountain, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 486-4730, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Gene Davis: 'Three Decades' A key member of the Washington Color School, which included Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, Davis was known for expansive canvases filled by narrow, vertical colored stripes. The best examples in this show are radiant. Charles Cowles, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-8999, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    'Head Over Hand: Pushing the Limits of Paint' This well-selected and cohesive 15-artist show presents finely wrought abstract paintings that mix, in most cases, a hedonistic materialism and a spacey, illusory dimension. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    * Guillaume Pinard: 'expresso' Surrealistic, darkly comical black ball-point pen drawings evoke a childlike mind under the influence of Gumby, the Muppets and Japanese anime, and an animated video follows the adventures of two eyeballs with arms and legs through shape-shifting landscapes. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    * JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212) 929-7000, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    Kyle Staver Influences of Matisse, Bonnard, Marsden Hartley and Milton Avery are conspicuous in Ms. Staver's playful, lushly painterly pictures of people enjoying holiday or domestic pleasures. Her hedonistic verve, humor and feeling for human relationships keep academic stuffiness at bay. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 675-2656, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    Richard Tuttle: 'Constructed Relief Paintings' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984'  The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck)    Tom Folland: 'Death-defying Dervish Gangbuster Rebel' This follower of Paul McCarthy appears in his own ridiculous, hyperactive videos wearing an athletic outfit and a gold, hairless head mask as he manically operates machines designed for destroying paintings. The machines are also on display, including a catapult for throwing a midget dummy version of the artist at paintings. Jack the Pelican, 487 Driggs Avenue, between North 9th and 10th Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 782-0183, through Feb. 5. (Johnson)    * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson)    'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson)    Last Chance    * SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, closes tomorrow.

Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101.    Broadway    'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Tuesday, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER'  A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION'  An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255. (Genzlinger)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)         Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    * 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE OTHER SIDE'  In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Anne Midgette)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'APRIL'S SHOWER' (No rating, 98 minutes) A lighthearted comedy about the outing of a bride-to-be and her five-year relationship with her maid of honor. Though filled with sitcom-ready stereotypes, ''April's Shower'' presents a refreshingly volatile view of sexual orientation. As faces are slapped and partners are switched, the movie leaves you with the feeling that gay is good, but bi can be even better. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)    * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)    'EL CARRO' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Pleasant but slight, this sociological farce from Colombia tells the story of a vintage convertible that changes the lives of the middle-class Velez family to mildly humorous effect. (Nathan Lee)    * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)    'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile.(Laura Kern)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)    'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE'  (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)    'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee)    'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee)    * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)    * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)    'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)    'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)    * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career and the most anguished. (Dargis)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)    'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Lee)    'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott)    * 'STATE OF FEAR: THE TRUTH ABOUT TERRORISM' (No rating, 94 minutes, in English and Spanish) Based on more than 16,000 testimonies to the Peruvian Truth & Reconciliation Commission, Pamela Yates's harrowing documentary chronicles the 20 years of terror between the rise of the Maoist leader Abimael Guzmán and his Shining Path guerrillas, and the November 2000 overthrow of President Alberto Fujimori's corrupt dictatorship. Together with ''The Montesinos Media Buy,'' seven minutes of surveillance video depicting the Fujimori regime's media bribery, ''State of Fear'' is a timely lesson on the hazards of choosing security over democracy. (Catsoulis)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manqué never develops any stamina. (Holden)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    Film Series    FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program is presenting a series of 11 feature films and 2 shorts by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82).

(Laura Sinagra)    AKRON/FAMILY, MI AND L'AU, WOODEN WAND (Tomorrow) This bill sandwiches the whispery Finland-based folk duo Mi and L'au between two weirder acts: the layered and deceptively melodic Akron/Family, a quiescent lo-fi quartet that explores the dark crannies and latent explosiveness of Americana, and Wooden Wand (a k a James Toth), who mixes modal guitars with mutters and yawps that suggest a Pentecostal drunk. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sinagra)    BURNSIDE PROJECT (Tonight) The Burnside Project plays its guitars in the intermittently splashing indie-rock style of the slacker 90's but uses electronic burbles beneath. 8, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra)    CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN, TRAMPLED BY TURTLES (Tomorrow) The 80's college-rock jokesters Camper van Beethoven recently reunited to release a concept album about a dystopian California.

She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 8 and 10, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, between Second and Third Streets, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra)    OLU DARA, RICHIE HAVENS (Monday) The cornetist Olu Dara leads a group that takes an amiable approach to a stream of good-time American music that runs from old jazz and blues to funk; he keeps audiences happy. An unswerving 60's holdout, Richie Havens is still strumming his guitar with untrammeled momentum, still singing in his grainy baritone and still bringing earnest drama out of protests and stubborn optimism. 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    THE ENGLISH BEAT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dave Wakeling still performs under the name of his old Birmingham band, which in the 80's mastered a soulful version of British ska and had hits with songs like the jittery ''Mirror in the Bathroom.'' 8, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    MARK EITZEL (Tonight) The American Music Club's Mark Eitzel continues his conspiratorial wallowing and baritone complaints, with increasingly electronic beats of late. The sad-folk outfit Last Town Chorus also plays. 8:30, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $12 in advance, $14 at the door.

(Sinagra)    HARD-FI (Tuesday) Using dub tactics like ominous echoes and faraway sirens to add dimension to its paranoid but melodic arena punk sound, this British band creates a more cavernous and even cinematic space than most. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    HUUN-HUUR-TU (Tomorrow) Cowboys from Tuva, where Siberia meets Mongolia, cultivate the technique of throat singing: producing a deep bass note and two or three harmonics above it, all at the same time. Tibetan monks use a similar technique for Buddhist chants. Huun-Huur-Tu uses the style for ancient herding songs and newer material. It is an eerie, riveting sound, like a growl linked to whistling winds, and it seems both raw and timeless. 8 p.m., Leonard Nimoy Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Pareles)    JAZZANOVA (Sunday) Alexander Barck performs as an ambassador of Berlin's Jazzanova, an electronic music collective that has always placed an emphasis on groove over glitch. 10 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, meatpacking district, (212) 645-5700; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) Freedy Johnston's finely turned country-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor. But for all their classic symmetry, they're the confessions of desperate, unsavory and unbalanced characters. 7:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Pareles)    B. B. KING: TRIBUTE TO MARTIN LUTHER KING (Sunday) The bluesman B. B. King's falsetto vocal flips and vibrato guitar licks have been an indelible influence on the blues and rock traditions. He made his musical reputation in Memphis, which is also where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. died. This Sunday, on the eve of Martin Luther King Day, he plays a show in the civil rights leader's honor. 7 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $35 to $100. (Sinagra)    THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco ornamented by clang and Moog-like warps.

(Sinagra)    KOOL KEITH, SLUM VILLAGE (Tomorrow) The shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith's Ultramagnetic MC's were a critical hit in the late 80's, helping to nudge old school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. Solo, he created personae like Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom, though his intricate, zany rhymes have grown less rewarding over time. Detroit's Slum Village also plays. 11:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    LYCAON PICTUS (Tomorrow) Aaron Diskin used to play with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' kinetic, stinging guitarist Nick Zinner, but Mr. Diskin's music for the synthesizer-bass-drum trio Lycaon Pictus is darker, recalling the apocalypse imagined by forerunners like Pere Ubu. 8 p.m., Kingsland Tavern, 244 Nassau Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-9883; $5. (Sinagra)    PABLO MAYOR AND FOLKLORE URBANO, FORRÓ FOR ALL (Thursday) Pablo Mayor's Folklore Urbano gives Colombian folk some modern inflections.

(Sinagra)    MI AND L'AU (Tonight) The Finnish singer Mi and the French musician L'au, after becoming a couple in Paris, reportedly moved to the woods in Finland to record what they will showcase here, a cache of austere, wintery bedroom folk. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sinagra)    ELIZABETH MITCHELL: YOU ARE MY FLOWER (Tomorrow) Like several indie-rockers, the soft-pop band Ida's Elizabeth Mitchell and Daniel Littleton have turned to making kids' music lately. Their approach takes the form of reinterpreting classic folk songs. Here Ms. Mitchell plays and sings selections from that repertory. 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, (212) 864-5400; $14; members and children, $10; Just Kidding Club members, $5.

(Sinagra)    MIGUEL POVEDA WITH GIOVANNI HIDALGO (Thursday through Jan. 21) Th0e raspy drama of traditional flamenco singing arrives in a new generation with Miguel Poveda, an award-winning flamenco vocalist.

Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Sinagra)    THE ROLLING STONES, METRIC (Wednesday) The Stones' newest album is their most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages, the Stones even seem politically relevant. Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Haines, Metric finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Haines's shuddering alto functions as both a weapon and a come-on. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra)    RYE COALITION (Tonight) Rye Coalition began as an angular rock band in the style of Fugazi but now mixes in more elements of 70's hard rock.

(Sinagra)    SUFJAN STEVENS (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter and banjoist is imbued with a Coplandesque musical vision and an expansive narcissism reminiscent of Walt Whitman's, though his lyrics can overreach and his compositions veer into the folksily baroque. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800; $20 to $45 (sold out).

(Pareles)    THE SYN (Tuesday) Back when the Who used to play the Marquee, the Syn used to open for them. One band member, Chris Squire, went on to become way more famous as the bassist with Yes. Forty years later, the Syn have re-formed to play their old proto-prog tunes and make new music as well. 7 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25.

(Sinagra)    THE WRENS (Tonight) These noise-artist rockers write about life in their home state of New Jersey, but not with a Fountains of Wayne smirk.

BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, $15 minimum.

(Chinen)    KENNY GARRETT QUARTET/HIROMI (Tuesday through Jan. 22) Mr. Garrett is a forceful and propulsive personality on the alto saxophone; Hiromi is a diminutive yet dynamic presence on electric keyboards and piano. Both artists favor tight ensembles, although that commonality doesn't quite explain this odd double bill. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen)    ROY HARGROVE AND MULGREW MILLER (Sunday) Mr. Hargrove, the trumpeter, and Mr. Miller, the pianist, share a postbop language especially rooted in the blues; their duo performance comes under the banner of chamber jazz, but the music they concoct should make the term seem quaint. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25.

(Chinen)    ROBERT HURST GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Hurst, a bassist with a deep and earthy tone, has long been a resourceful small-group composer, as well as an underappreciated bandleader. This weekend he applies those talents to two distinct crews: a next-generation quartet with the pianist Robert Glasper, the guitarist Lionel Loueke and the drummer Karriem Riggins (tonight); and a quintet of somewhat more experienced peers, like the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the alto saxophonist Donald Harrison and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson (tomorrow). 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    GRETCHEN PARLATO (Tomorrow; Tuesday through Jan. 21) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a continuing deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, which is never more pronounced than when she performs with the guitarist Lionel Loueke. Tomorrow at 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. Tuesday through Thursday at 11 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

(Chinen)    RE:ARRANGED: THE MUSIC OF JACO PASTORIUS, GIL EVANS, LENNON & McCARTNEY (Through Sunday) The sweep of this project, which clearly runs the risk of incoherence, could be a perfect challenge for the pianist and accordionist Gil Goldstein, one of the most resourceful arrangers in jazz today.

(Chinen)    CHRIS POTTER TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Potter is among the small number of tenor saxophonists to have absorbed both Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane and emerged sounding like his own man; he appears here in the setting that both predecessors helped popularize, backed only by bass (Scott Colley) and drums (Jeff Ballard). 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10.

(Chinen)    KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel is almost certainly the most widely hailed jazz guitarist under 40, especially among musicians; his deeply sympathetic rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner provides the focal point of this shadowy and slippery ensemble, which also includes Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Eric Harland on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    * RANDY WESTON AND FRIENDS (Tomorrow) The pianism of Randy Weston can recall that of Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, but as a composer he has long reached beyond strict jazz traditions; this concert, dubbed ''The Spirit of Afrika,'' will commemorate the year of his 80th birthday with an assortment of friends, including the saxophonists Billy Harper and Cecil Payne, the trombonist Benny Powell, the trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater and the conga virtuoso Candido. 8 p.m., Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, Long Island University, 1 University Place, at DeKalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, ext. 2229, or www.651ARTS.org; $35, $45 and $80. (Chinen)    REGGIE WORKMAN'S BREW (Tuesday) Mr. Workman's bass playing has always evinced a graceful athleticism and an attunement to texture; here he organizes a setting that should emphasize both traits, in a trio with Miya Masaoka on koto and Gerry Hemingway on percussion. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $15.

(Midgette)    BRONX OPERA (Tomorrow and Sunday) There are some -- O.K., maybe it's just me -- who consider Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' the perfect opera: a wrenching story, spectacular vocal and ensemble music, and it all clocks in at about 50 minutes. The enterprising Bronx Opera has paired this story of royal passion and supernatural mischief with Chabrier's ''Incomplete Education,'' a light piece about a young newlywed's search for information on how to proceed. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., the Lovinger Theater at Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $15 to $30. (Allan Kozinn)    CHAMBERFEST (Tuesday through Thursday) You might think that the Juilliard School had enough to handle with its ambitious musical celebration of its centenary, not to mention the annual Focus festival, coming up at the end of the month. But this week the school is also presenting this series of free concerts of diverse chamber works performed by accomplished student musicians. There are piano trios by Ives and Shostakovich; works by Beethoven and Dvorak will jostle against works by Stravinsky and Morton Feldman. For those who like large-scale chamber pieces, there is Mendelssohn's rousing Octet. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. at Paul Hall at the Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street; Wednesday at 1 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406. (Tommasini)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight, Sunday and Tuesday) With substantial help from the conductor Reinbert de Leeuw and the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, the society offers a Ligeti mini-festival with three programs that cover a broad range of this great Hungarian composer's chamber and solo keyboard works. Among the highlights are ''Mysteries of the Macabre'' and ''Aventures/Nouvelles Aventures'' tonight; Mr. Aimard's performance of a handful of the knucklebreaking Études on Sunday; and a program for strings and winds on Tuesday, with Imani Winds and the Brentano String Quartet, as well as solo works played by the cellist Clancy Newman and the violist Paul Neubauer. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Kozinn)    'COMPOSER=PERFORMER' (Thursday) Adventurous programming has been part of Symphony Space's calendar on and off over the years, but lately the hall seems intent on joining the Miller Theater as a new-music center on the Upper West Side. In ''Composer=Performer,'' it offers music written and performed by Todd Reynolds, one of the violinists in the quartet Ethel; Joan La Barbara, who is known for her range-stretching vocalizing; and John King, a guitarist and violinist who will offer a preview of a score he is writing for the Mannheim Ballet. 7:30 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $21; $16 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)    GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Sunday) This venerable quartet is celebrating its 40th-anniversary season, and the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, which offers top-flight artists at affordable prices, is presenting the group in an all-Mozart program. 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; sold out, but returned tickets, at $9 and $11, may be available at the box office. (Midgette)    THOMAS HAMPSON (Thursday) This American baritone has long been acclaimed for his insightful singing of German lieder, but he is also a champion of American song. In collaboration with the Library of Congress, Mr. Hampson is embarking on an 11-city American tour with a program that covers American song from the 1700's to the present. There will be psalms, hymns, folk songs, cowboy songs, spirituals and art songs -- not just by familiar composers like Bernstein and Copland but also by influential (and overlooked) composers like Arthur Farwell and Elinor Remick Warren. Wolfram Rieger will be the pianist. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $72.(Tommasini)    MANHATTAN STRING QUARTET (Tuesday) Thirty-five years old and going strong, this group is presenting a complete cycle of the Shostakovich quartets during its residency at St. Bart's. This week: Nos. 9 through 12. 7:30 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 51st Street, (212) 378-0248; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Midgette)    MEREDITH MONK YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Sunday) Ms. Monk, the eclectic and soulful composer-singer-performance artist, has spent the last week working with a group of young singers with impressive backgrounds in contemporary music and performance, teaching them the rudiments of her own distinctive vocal technique. Sunday's concluding concert presents those singers in an evening of Ms. Monk's work, including excerpts from her opera ''Atlas.'' 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15. (Midgette)    MUSIC OFF THE WALLS (Sunday) ''Manufactured Landscapes,'' the Brooklyn Museum's exhibition of Edward Burtynsky's photographs, ends on Sunday, but just as these pictures of industrial sites are about to be packed up, musicians from the Brooklyn Philharmonic will offer a program of chamber works that also evoke landscapes, natural and industrial. The composers are Debussy, Varèse, Cage, John Luther Adams and Theodore Wiprud. 3 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 488-5913; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)    NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Sunday) Neeme Jarvi leads his New Jersey players in the first installment of ''The Many Faces of Mozart,'' a festival -- among the first of roughly a gazillion scheduled around the world this year -- celebrating the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth. The concert's title, ''Mozart's Autumn Years,'' is a bit odd for a composer who died at 35, but you get the idea: included are late works, including the Symphony No. 41 and the incomparably beautiful Clarinet Concerto, with Karl Herman as the soloist. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Tuesday) The Juilliard School continues its centennial celebrations with a free program organized by the New York Festival of Song, titled ''100 Years of Juilliard Composers in Song.'' Some 24 works will be performed by students from the vocal arts program, exploring both faculty and student composers, among them Milton Babbitt, Luciano Berio, John Corigliano, Ned Rorem, Norman Dello Joio and even Richard Rodgers. The pianists will be Steven Blier and Michael Barrett, the founding directors of the New York Festival of Song. 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Tommasini)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * 'ARISTOPHANES IN BIRDONIA' (Tonight though Sunday; Thursday though Jan. 22) David Gordon, Valda Setterfield and their Pick Up Performance Co. made a big splash two years ago with ''Dancing Henry V'' (reprised last March), and now they're back at St. Mark's Church with another dance-theater piece inspired by a classic drama, ''The Birds.'' Ms. Setterfield plays the playwright, and expect pointed references to contemporary events. Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday through Jan. 22, at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $20. (John Rockwell)    LORI BELILOVE & COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow) ''From Russia With Love,'' a program inspired by the troupe's recent tour of Russia, features dances choreographed by Isadora Duncan when that great modern-dance pioneer visited Russia early in the 20th century. 7:30 p.m., Isadora Duncan Dance Foundation Studios, 141 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-5040, www.isadoraduncan.org; $25 in advance, $30 at the door.(Jack Anderson)    COIL: A WINTER DANCE FESTIVAL (Thursday through Jan. 24) Bravo to Performance Space 122, which (in association with the Joyce Foundation) has quietly come up with an intriguing mix of troupes for this six-day festival. The Australian company BalletLab will make its American debut in Philip Adams's ''Amplification''; another Australian performer, Helen Herbertson, will present ''Strike 1''; and LeeSaar The Company and Adrienne Truscott bring back works first performed at this theater last year. P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at East Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288; $20; $15 for students; $10 for 65+. Call for performance schedule. (Roslyn Sulcas)    COMPAÑÍA. ARROYO. ARDIENTE (Thursday) This first performance by Julio Arroyo's company reflects his interest in the common threads in just about every form of dance and his inspiration from other choreographers, among them Jessica Kondrath and five other guest artists on the program. (Through Jan. 22.) Thursday at 9 p.m.; next Friday at 9:30 p.m.; Jan. 22 at 7:30 p.m., Soundance at the Stable, 281 North Seventh Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 413-8196: $12; students and 65+, $5. (Jennifer Dunning)    * DANCE ON CAMERA (Today and tomorrow) New York's (and America's) premier festival of dance films finishes up at the Walter Reade Theater with especially interesting programs tonight at 8:30 and tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. Today at 1, 3:30, 6:15 and 8:30 p.m.; tomorrow at 1 and 3:30 p.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-3809 or www.filmlinc.com. Complete schedule at www.dancefilmsassn.org. (Rockwell)    JESSE PHILLIPS-FEIN (Monday) In this free program, called ''Wilderness,'' Ms. Fein, who trained at places as various as the Brooklyn Arts Exchange and the Laban Center in London, explores the large forces that help to shape the small fabric of a life, as she puts it. Megan Metcalf will show dance video. 7 p.m., Swing Space, 15 Nassau Street, between Cedar and Pine Streets, Lower Manhattan, (347) 268-1012. (Dunning)    FULL CIRCLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Innaviews'' takes a look at the lives of hip-hop dancers. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $20 and $12.(Anderson)    SAVION GLOVER (Tonight and tomorrow) This Tony Award-winning tap stylist (''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'') is back again, doing what he does best. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $34 to $42. (Dunning)    EMIO GRECO/PC (Tuesday through Jan. 22) This Netherlands-based company is run by the Italian choreographer Emio Greco and the Dutch theater director Pieter C. Scholten. Their ''Conjunto di Nero'' is a full-evening work for six dancers who are, according to press materials, ''dressed in wooly black garments.'' Tuesday through Jan. 21 at 8 p.m., and Jan. 22 at 2 and 7:30 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $38. (Sulcas)    SHANNON HUMMEL/CORA DANCE (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Hummel's ''Elsewhere,'' a work in progress, addresses the aftermath of devastation and the emotional forces that push through, in dance known for its eloquent telling of small but consequential tales. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-0018 or www.bax.org; $8 to $15. (Dunning)    'THE JUILLIARD SCHOOL, 1905-2005: CELEBRATING 100 YEARS'  (Today and tomorrow) This is the closing weekend for this free multimedia exhibition on one of the nation's most influential performing conservatories, whose history is depicted in photographs, playbills, correspondence, musical scores, and audiotapes and videos of classes and performances of music, theater and dance. Today and tomorrow from noon to 6 p.m., New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-1630 or www.nyp.org. Six speakers, including Linda Kent and Lawrence Rhodes, will participate in a free panel discussion on the recent history of the school's dance division. Tomorrow at 3 p.m. in the library's Bruno Walter Auditorium, (212) 642-0142. (Dunning)    BRENDAN McCALL AND HENRY HILL (Thursday) Mr. Hill, a musician turned dancer, addresses life and love in new work on the program. Mr. McCall, a dancer, choreographer and director, looks partly to Homer's ''Odyssey'' for his inspiration. 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736 or www .dixonplace .org; $12 or T.D.F.; students and 65+, $10. (Dunning)    MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP (Sunday) Need we say more? Sunday at 3 p.m., Performing Arts Center, Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6200; $40 to $60.(Dunning)    MOVEMENT RESEARCH AT THE JUDSON CHURCH 'ABOUT TOWN' (Sunday) This free weekly winter forum offers choreographers a low-pressure context to experiment with ideas rather than present a finished work. (At least that's the theory; no doubt they get nervous anyway.) This week's lineup includes the wonderful former Merce Cunningham dancer Kimberly Bartosik, Sam Kim and Chris Yon. 8 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 598-0551.(Sulcas)    BEN MUNISTERI (Wednesday through Jan. 21) Mr. Munisteri was one of the most compelling of Doug Elkins's performers many years ago; now he makes dances that match his unpredictable, frisky stage presence. You also have to appreciate the range of his musical tastes: A new work, ''Tuesday, 4 a.m. and other dances,'' is set to Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra, while the older ''Turbine Mines'' is set to the ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack as accompaniment. 7:30 p.m. (next Friday, also at 10 p.m.), Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 9224-0077; $25; $15 for students, 65+ or artists. (Sulcas)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Today through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Peter Martins's full-length ''Swan Lake'' continues through Wednesday, with the regular mixed-repertory bills picking up again on Thursday. Tonight and tomorrow and Thursday nights at 8; tomorrow afternoon at 2; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.; New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or www.nycballet.com;$30 to $86. (Rockwell)    'THE SEVEN' (Wednesday and Thursday) The New York Theater Workshop's hip-hop adaptation of Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'' has choreography by Bill T. Jones as well as music and text by Will Powers and direction by Jo Bonney. (Opening night is scheduled for Feb. 12.) 8 p.m., New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $60; $15 for available student tickets. (Dunning)    TROIKA RANCH (Wednesday through Saturday)) This high-technology dance and video company will perform its new ''16 [R]evolutions.'' Come early and play with the technology. 8 p.m., Eyebeam Art & Technology Center, 540 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (718) 218-6775 or www.troikaranch.org; $16; $20 (Tuesday through Thursday). (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,'  through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRaPHY: 'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from Southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. On the secular side but equally dazzling are two portraits of men from a long series of male visages done by Antonello in the 1460's and 70's. The intensely human play of expression on the subjects' faces makes a connection with the viewer that few artists before or since have been able to achieve. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Grace Glueck)    MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck)    * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Holland Cotter)    * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, (800) 944-8639. (Johnson)    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. This substantial exhibition of works on paper extends the full-scale Bluemner retrospective now at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    * SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    Galleries: Chelsea    Marina Abramovic: 'Balkan Erotic Epic' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    Douglas Anderson: 'New Old Robots' Painted in grayed colors and a brushy, cartoonish style that recalls the Ash Can School and 1930's-era Social Realism, Mr. Anderson's comical and mournful small paintings depict old shoes, plumbing, brick walls, junk cars and outmoded industrial machinery in states of dreamlike animation. Blue Mountain, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 486-4730, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    'Head Over Hand: Pushing the Limits of Paint' This well-selected and cohesive 15-artist show presents finely wrought abstract paintings that mix in most cases a hedonistic materialism and a spacey, illusory dimension. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    PHILIPPE MAZAUD: STAGE LIGHT  Roaming the countryside in rural Idaho and Nevada, Mr. Mazaud shoots provocative, sometimes spooky night scenes using only found light. Following a current tendency to make pictures that don't tell tales, but move viewers to create their own, he presents scenarios like a small house on a snowy street with two bright windows giving evidence of occupancy, illumined by a streetlight near an old-fashioned telephone pole strung with taut, crisscrossing wires. It could be the setting for domestic felicity or mayhem. Foley, 527 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Jan. 21. (Glueck)    * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Bryan Savitz The inventive Mr. Savitz presents a forest of fake tree trunks and objects, like a hammock and a pipe organ, made mainly of scratch-off lottery tickets. A wild group show in the rear gallery called ''Waiting for the Barbarians'' includes a Beaux-Arts-style pornographic vision of flying cowgirls painted by Nicola Verlato; a horribly abused anthropomorphic pig in a sculptural tableau by Fernando Mastrangelo; a large, Dalí-esque ballpoint pen drawing by Tim Maxwell; and a big, semi-abstract digital photograph by Chris Rodrigues, apparently illustrating an otherworldly epic. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 268-1520, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)    * JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212) 929-7000, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    Richard Tuttle: 'Constructed Relief Paintings' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'I woke up in a strange place ' The Postmodern mindscape gets a good workout in a show that includes Samantha Simpson's finely drawn allegorical monkeys; Simon Keenleyside's small paintings of gloomily magical birch forests; a puddle of vomit made of pearlescent pink sequins by Craig Fisher; Edward del Rosario's precise paintings of tiny, oddly dressed people; and a Neo- Pop installation representing an old world hunting-lodge interior by Ryan Humphrey. Moti Hasson, 330 West 38th Street, (212) 268-4444, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    Last Chance    Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, closing Sunday. (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * TAMY BEN-TOR, 'EXPLORATION IN THE DOMAIN OF IDIOCY' On video -- and live on Friday and Saturday afternoons -- a wonderfully talented comic performance artist creates hilariously self-absorbed characters. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, closing tomorrow.
