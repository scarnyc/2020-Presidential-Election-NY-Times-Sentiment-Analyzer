Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.

Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Jerry Zaks's revival of the 1983 musical often gives the impression of merely going through the motions of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it too suffers from fundmental mistmatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING' Cheers to the British cabaret trio that calls itself Fascinating Aida. These women revel in the here and now. They are bawdy and political; loopy (in that crisp English way) and whimsical (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Margo Jefferson)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE FALSE SERVANT' Decked out in a smart black tailcoat, Martha Plimpton cuts a debonair figure in this revival of this unusually chilly Marivaux comedy. Ms. Plimpton's dashing performance imbues the proceedings with a bright, puckish spirit, but the mechanical staging emphasizes the nip that never leaves the air (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That would appear to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in the New Group's smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific, uncompromising cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MONK' Rome Neal eases his way through this solo play about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, taking his time to tell the story of an artist he clearly loves. But this is not the show for jazz fans that want to delve deep into Monk's psychology or learn something new about his process (1:30). Havoc, 312 West 36th Street, (718)288-8048. (Jason Zinoman)    'MOONLIGHT AND MAGNOLIAS' Hollywood ghosts squabble like starving chickens in Ron Hutchinson's shrill, obstreperously silly comedy about the making of ''Gone With the Wind'' (1:50). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)    'ORANGE FLOWER WATER' Craig Wright's play is about two marriages coming apart. The hurt that people cause one another is communicated only through words in this play -- sometimes too many of them (1:30). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)868-4444. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side-effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)    'PRIVILEGE' Paul Weitz's delicate if uneven comedy examines the collateral damage sustained by the family of a disgraced titan of Wall Street. Conor Donovan and Harry Zittel are terrific as the sons of the fallen businessman (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)    * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100 . (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SOULS OF NAPLES' As a lovable dupe who is happier tangling with a family of phantoms than facing the cold truths of his marriage, John Turturro exudes a winsome sincerity that pleasantly perfumes Roman Paska's otherwise flaccid production of this 1946 comedy by Eduardo De Filippo (2:00). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200 (Isherwood).    Off Off Broadway    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'THE THREE MUSKETEERS' A lot of story and actors have been crammed into this musical version. Unfortunately, that seems to have left little room for other crucial ingredients, like panache (2:30). Wings, 154 Christopher Street, (212)627-2961. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large transvestite (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley).    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). 47th Street, 304 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BONNIE PARKER' There is probably a lot of rich material in the psyche of Parker, who made her name as the bank-robbing partner of Clyde Barrow, but in her deadly one-woman show, Dixie Lee Sedgwick gives her audience only a one-dimensional character (2:00). Houseman Studio Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    * 'DAME EDNA; BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'FAUST IN LOVE' The Target Margin Theater's take on Goethe's metaphysical epic of a professor selling his soul to the devil for knowledge comes off with all the sophistication of an over-long ''Saturday Night Live'' skit (1:15). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)358-3657, closing tomorrow. (Phoebe Hoban)    'FINNEGANS WAKE' The idea of basing a musical on James Joyce's epic and near-impenetrable feast of language sounds perilously close to material for a skit on ''Saturday Night Live.'' But to the credit of Barbara Vann, who adapted the piece for the stage, her Medicine Show Theater Ensemble presents pure Joyce (2:30). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212) 868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Anne Midgette).    'FIT TO KILL' It takes a certain type of actor to pull off comic noir, but someone forgot to tell whoever cast this who's-going-to-murder-whom thriller (2:00) . Clurman, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'KASIMIR AND KAROLINE' The Slovak director Pavol Liska has a real talent forstaging, but while his production of Odon von Horvath's portrait of a corrupted society -- relocated from Munich in the 1930's to a contemporary world -- is pleasing to the eye, style often overshadows substance (1:30). Nature Theater of Oklahoma, at the Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, (212)726-1578, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'MARGO VEIL' Len Jenkin's one-act play about a young, aspiring actress and intertwined lives falls somewhere between David Lynch and ''Saturday Night Live'' but it's also intricate, clever and solidly entertaining (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'ROBESON' The larger-than-life actor and activist Paul Robeson is a tall order for any play -- or for that matter actor -- to capture. But despite its limitations, it serves as a provocative primer to an historical figure who deserves a fuller analysis (2:10). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Hoban)    'ROMANCE' In his latest work, David Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either (1:35). Atlantic, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' A surprisingly mischievous rendering of George Bernard Shaw's first play, an 1892 bit of social criticism masquerading as a love story (2:15). 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, (212)598-9802, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes). A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)    'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' (G, 48 minutes). A hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome. (Stephen Holden)    'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes). Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)    'BEAUTY SHOP' (PG-13, 105 minutes). Less a sequel than an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff, this loose and genial comedy moves the ''Barbershop'' franchise to Atlanta, and gives the ladies a turn at the warm, salty banter that made the first two installments so popular. (A.O. Scott)    'THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE' (R, 112 minutes). A proud survivor of the 1960's and its utopian promise, Jack (Daniel Day-Lewis) lives alone on an island with his only daughter. A story about the limits of love, ''Ballad'' is also about the limits of idealism as well as, rather unfortunately, those of its restlessly ambitious writer and director, Rebecca Miller. (Dargis)    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali), A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (Scott)    'BE COOL' (PG-13, 112 minutes). John Travolta returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in ''Get Shorty,'' which arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction.'' But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty. (Dargis)    * 'THE BEST OF YOUTH' (not rated, six hours and 23 minutes, shown in two parts; in Italian). Marco Tullio Giordana's six-hour journey through recent Italian history is nothing less than a masterpiece, combining epic sweep with precise, heart-rending intimacy. (Scott)    'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' (PG-13, 111 minutes). This Bollywood-style musical -- which transposes Jane Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. (Dargis)    'CONSTANTINE' (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Keanu Reeves glowers his way through another effects-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. (Scott)    'DEAD AND BREAKFAST' (not rated, 88 minutes). Matthew Leutwyler's horror movie about six young people trapped in a creepy small town goes for parody and fails. There is no suspense or real fun but tons of gore. (Anita Gates)    'DOWNFALL' (not rated, 155 minutes; in German). Bruno Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses. The film's most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. (Scott)    'EATING OUT' (not rated, 85 minutes). A dreary erotic roundelay: a modern-day variant on a Shakespeare comedy, only without the verbal felicity or sense of dramatic structure. (Dana Stevens)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes). This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)    '15' (not rated, 90 minutes, in Hokkien and Mandarin). A Singaporean film about the desultory adventures of a gang of disaffected youth starring young nonprofessional actors who aren't any good. (Stevens)    * 'GUNNER PALACE' (PG-13, 86 minutes). Raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary about American soldiers in Iraq than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. (Scott)    'GUESS WHO' (PG-13, 103 minutes). A loose, pointless remake of ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' (Scott)    'HAPPILY EVER AFTER' (not rated, 100 minutes; in French). A likable skin-deep sex comedy, which tries half-heartedly to present itself as a treatise on marriage. (Holden)    * 'HEAD-ON' (not rated, 118 minutes; in German and Turkish). This film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of 2005. (Dargis)    'HITCH' (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Will Smith as a dating coach. (Scott)    'HOSTAGE' (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero. (Holden)    'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes). Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)    'IN MY COUNTRY' (R, 104 minutes). Juliette Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of this high-minded but hopelessly wooden film. (Holden)    'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' (NC-17, 90 minutes). A lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary about Linda Lovelace, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat.'' (Dargis)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes). A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG' (R, 88 minutes). A dance club D.J. loses his hearing and then his grip in this surprisingly sweet faux documentary, while Paul Kaye keeps us interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless. (Dargis)    'THE JACKET' (R, 102 minutes). Adrien Brody plays Jack Starks, who is sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. (Scott)    'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes). The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden)    'KONTROLL' (R, 106 minutes; in Hungarian). Shot entirely in the Budapest subway system, Nimrod Antal's debut film is a grungy, shaggy-dog allegory -- a stylish, meandering trip to nowhere in particular. (Scott)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese). This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French). A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MADISON' (PG, 105 minutes). This film about hydroplane racing in a small Indiana town wants to be both heartwarming and quirky but is sometimes just cutesy instead. The cast does a fine job, but only moviegoers who care about nitrous-oxide injection systems are likely to appreciate the story. (Gates)    'THE MAN WHO COPIED' (not rated, 124 minutes, in Portuguese). From kitchen-sink realism, to unconvincing caper fantasy, this Brazilian film about a photocopier-turned-counterfeiter loses its bearings the moment it leaps from one to the other. (Holden)    'MELINDA AND MELINDA' (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though Woody Allen's drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, the director interweaves them deftly enough. (Scott)    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' (PG-13, 135 minutes). Clint Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. (Scott)    * 'MILLIONS' (PG, 97 minutes). Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Danny Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. (Dargis)    'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. (Dargis)    'NIGHT OF HENNA' (not rated, 95 minutes). In the tradition of ''The Jazz Singer'' and ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'': a young Pakistani woman living in San Francisco rebels against her impending arranged marriage. Sincere but amateurish. (Scott)    'ODESSA ... ODESSA!' (not rated, 96 minutes). Most of the people who gather to reminisce and sing the old songs in this mournful, slowly paced cinematic poem are Jewish exiles from the decrepit Ukrainian city, which they remember as paradise. (Holden)    'OLD BOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean). The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'ONE MISSED CALL' (not rated, 100 minutes; in Japanese). Take the Japanese horror film ''Ringu,'' replace the deadly videotapes with killer cellphones, and add a baroque, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink climactic sequence involving ghosts, zombies, disembodied limbs and pickled fetuses. Are you sure you want to take this call? (Stevens)    'THE PACIFIER' (PG, 97 minutes). Despite the specter of boogeymen, this family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. (Ned Martel)    'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes). The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'PERLASCA' (not rated, 104 minutes; in Italian). In Hungary in 1944, Giorgio Perlasca saved the lives of thousands of Jews, and his memory deserves better than this inept Italian television film. (Gates)    'THE RING TWO' (PG-13, 111 minutes). In ''The Ring,'' Rachel (Naomi Watts), a journalist and single mom, escaped the marauding ghost in the machine, and she now thinks she has entered a new chapter. No such luck; she is actually mucking about on a slag heap of recycled scares, dumb lines and predictable entanglements. (Dargis)    'RAGING DOVE' (not rated, 70 minutes). A bruising but illuminating documentary considers how nationalism flattened one young, sure-footed boxer, who was born in Nazareth to a Palestinian family. (Martel)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes). This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SAVE THE GREEN PLANET' (not rated, 118 minutes; in Korean). A dog named Earth and aliens both domestic and imported rotate around one another in this self-consciously freaky, rambunctiously goofy genre hybrid from South Korea. Just don't ask what it all means. (Dargis)    * 'SCHIZO' (not rated, 86 minutes, in Russian). This modest neo-realist film from Kazhakstan is both tough and tender. As the movie follows the conventions of a crime-tinged coming-of-age story, it achieves a rough, convincing poetry. (Scott)    'SHORT CUT TO NIRVANA: KUMBH MELA' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Hindi). Seventy million pilgrims gather in India to seek enlightenment; this engaging documentary travelogue, as the title suggests, will save you the trip. (Scott)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes). Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    'STATE PROPERTY II' (R, 94 minutes). Better than the first one, which isn't saying much, but this brutal celebration of the spirit of capitalism has some moments of energy and wit. (Scott)    * 'TORREMOLINOS 73' (not rated, 91 minutes, in Spanish). This movie's gentle, humanist vision of pornographic filmmaking as a sexual and aesthetic act of emancipation is a far cry from the graphic social realism of recent films like ''A Hole in My Heart.'' (Stevens)    'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen to do some marvelous work. (Scott)    'WALK ON WATER' (not rated, 104 minutes). The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax and a cloying conclusion, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    'THE WILD PARROTS OF TELEGRAPH HILL' (G, 83 minutes). The subject of this small, affectionate documentary is a pony-tailed, 50-ish San Franciscan who tends a flock of around four dozen wild parrots. (Holden)    'WINNING GIRLS THROUGH PSYCHIC MIND CONTROL' (not rated, 93 minutes). Sam (Ruben Santiago-Hudson) suddenly develops psychic powers in this likable but only sporadically funny comedy. (Gates)    'WINTER SOLSTICE' (R, 93 minutes). This is the kind of ambling, event-free family drama that will either draw audiences in with its understated power, or quietly bore them out of their skulls. (Stevens)    Film Series    'ASIAN CINEVISIONS' (tomorrow). Sandra Oh (''Sideways'') and the Chinese-Canadian director Mina Shum, who worked together in the 1994 romantic comedy ''Double Happiness,'' continue their collaboration in ''Long Life, Happiness and Prosperity.'' Ms. Oh plays a single mother in Vancouver. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, (718)636-4100; $10. (Stevens)    'OLIVE THOMAS: EVERYBODY'S SWEETHEART' (tomorrow). A new documentary about the now-forgotten 1920's starlet, who married Mary Pickford's brother Jack before dying under mysterious circumstances in Paris at the age of 26, will be followed by a screening of one of Thomas's most successful films, ''Flapper.'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400; $10, $8 for 65+, $6 for students. (Stevens)    MASSIMO TROISI (through May 5). The Neapolitan actor Massimo Troisi, who died of a heart attack at age 41 after achieving international renown in the title role of ''The Postman'' (1994), was well known in Italy as a writer and director of comic films. The Film Society of Lincoln Center is showing five of Troisi's own films. Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600; $10, $7 for students, $6 for members, $5 for children and 65+. (Stevens)    'SPEEDY' (today and tomorrow). Film Forum's exhaustive Harold Lloyd retrospective features Lloyd's last silent film, ''Speedy'' (1928), in which the bespectacled comic, playing a scatterbrained cabbie, gives the real-life Babe Ruth a lift to Yankee Stadium. 209 West Houston Street, South Village; (212)727-8110; $10; $5 for members and children under 12.

(Ratliff)    URI CAINE TRIO (Tuesday through May 8) Mr. Caine has put in plenty of time playing in jazz trios around his native Philadelphia; hence his straight-ahead sets here with the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Ben Perowsky. But he's probably become better known for an expanded repertory including re-imagined classical music. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-4037, cover, $30. (Ratliff)    DENA DE ROSE (Through Sunday) A jazz singer-pianist with a high musicality. 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232, cover, $25 and $20 on Sunday.

(Ratliff)    CHARLES GAYLE TRIO (Tonight) The tenor saxophonist achieved some notoriety in the early 90's as the living embodiment of the first free-jazz era, playing sustained, energetic improvizations with a trio; more recently he's pulled back from the precipice a bit. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C at 2nd Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com, $10.

(Ratliff)    FREDDIE HUBBARD AND THE NEW JAZZ COMPOSERS OCTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Hubbard, the trumpeter, has been making sporadic stabs at coming back; he was, at least, a hard-driving player whose improvisational power remained high throughout the 1980's. 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212)582-2121, cover, $30 to $32.50, $10 minimum at a table and $5 minimum at the bar.

Opera    'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' (Tuesday) Opera buffs have been rushing to the Met to see the ''new'' Deborah Voigt, who looks and sounds just terrific since undergoing gastric bypass surgery. But for the final ''Ballo'' of the season, Aprile Millo takes over the role of Amelia. And this impassioned soprano has her own coterie of devoted fans. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $170. (Anthony Tommasini)    'BEFORE NIGHT FALLS' (Monday and Tuesday) Its first act, heard last year in a reading of American Opera Projects, was strikingly fine. Now Jorge Martin's complete opera based on Reinaldo Arenas's memoir is ready for its close-up -- as a reading, of excerpts -- in conjunction with the Cuban Arts Festival. 8 p.m., Clark Studio Theater, Rose Building, Lincoln Center, (718)398-4024, $15, $12 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)    'LA CLEMENZA DI TITO' (Tonight and Monday) James Levine is hardly alone in believing that Mozart's rush-job opera seria, completed just three months before he died, is a noble, stunning and underappreciated work. Starting tonight, he conducts the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized yet dignified 1984 production, with a fine cast headed by Frank Lopardo, Anne Sofie von Otter and Sarah Connolly. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House (see above), $35 to $200 tonight, $26 to $170 on Monday. (Tommasini)    'FAUST' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In a revelatory performance that cuts through the sentimentality and hokum of Gounod's ''Faust,'' James Levine captures the music's dignity and elegance. And the Met has assembled a top-rank cast, especially René Pape as Mephistopheles. Alas, the new production by Andrei Serban is a jumble, with no discernable concept and no consistent look. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House (see above); sold out tomorrow, $95 to $170 remaining on Wednesday. (Tommasini)    'MARIO AND THE MAGICIAN' (Tonight and tomorrow). The veteran composer Francis Thorne has long been an essential figure in New York contemporary music circles. So it's good news that Mr. Thorne's new opera, based on the Thomas Mann story, with a libretto by J.D. McClatchy, will have its professional premiere by the Center for Contemporary Opera. 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212)772-4448, $30 to $50. (Tommasini)    'ORPHÉE ET EURIDICE' (Monday) The contralto Ewa Podles has become a cult figure in the opera world, and the Oratorio Society of New York has snared her for a role she's already committed to record: Gluck's ''Orpheus,'' in the Berlioz version, with Jennifer Aylmer as her Euridice. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $17 to $75. (Midgette)    'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow, Thursday) Franco Zeffirelli's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to stage direction reaches its apotheosis with this opulent production, which the Met stocks with serviceable but hardly headlining voices. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House (see above); $40 to $215 tomorrow, $26 to $170 on Thursday. (Midgette)    Classical Music    BANG ON A CAN ALL-STARS WITH IVA BITTOVA (Tonight) She's been labeled everything from experimental to pop avant-garde: whatever you call her, the Czech singer and violinist Iva Bittova doesn't make many American appearances. This one coincides with an upcoming CD on Canteloupe Music and features music of Ms. Bittova, Glenn Branca and other Downtown icons. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $20 and $32.

Oestreich)    'FROM PROUST TO BOULEZ' (Tonight and Sunday) Both Marcel Proust and Pierre Boulez were French. It's not clear what else links this pair of concerts except that they're the first ventures of a new chamber series with the ''Alliance Players.'' The Proust evening, tonight, offers Saint-Saens and Franck; Sunday's concert celebrates Mr. Boulez's 80th birthday. Tonight at 8, Sunday night at 7:30, French Institute/Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, (212)307-4100, $15 for each concert. (Midgette)    SOILE ISOKOSKI (Sunday) It is, simply, a lovely voice. This Finnish soprano takes a break from her run of ''Faust'' at the Met to offer a recital program that wends its way between the familiar (Mozart and Wolf songs, Wagner's ''Wesendonck Lieder'') and the less familiar: songs by Ture Rangstrom, a Swedish contemporary of Strauss, and Aulis Sallinen, a contemporary Finnish composer. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $28 and $38. (Midgette)    EVGENY KISSIN AND JAMES LEVINE (Sunday) This collaboration has worked fantastically with Mr. Levine on the podium and Mr. Kissin at the keyboard, but here they share a piano bench to play Schubert, while listeners take bets on whether their very different keyboard styles -- Mr. Kissin is a firebrand, Mr. Levine a rationalist -- can be made to gel. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall. (212)247-7800, $39 to $134. (Kozinn)    KREMERATA BALTICA SOLOISTS (Tuesday) ''Shostakovich and After,'' the Shostakovich including the Symphony No. 15, the After being a work by Alexander Wustin.

(Oestreich)    BLAIR McMILLEN (Wednesday) This prodigiously talented and adventurous young pianist is known mostly for championing contemporary music. On this program he plays either original or arranged works from the Faenza manuscript of early Italian keyboard music. Not surprisingly, he also gives the premieres of works by Fabrizio De Rossi Re and Matthew Greenbaum based on the manuscript. 8 p.m., Casa Italiana at Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, between 116th and 118th Streets, Morningside Heights, (212)854-1623, $12, $5 for students and 65+.

(Oestreich)    ITZHAK PERLMAN (Wednesday) For such a household name, you don't find too many opportunities these days to hear Itzhak Perlman in a traditional full-length recital. Here he is playing music by Mozart, Beethoven, Smetana and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich with the pianist Rohan De Silva. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $35 to $70. (Eichler)    PETER SERKIN (Sunday) Known for his adventurous programming, Mr. Serkin is really having fun with this piano recital, presented by the essential Free for All at Town Hall series. Besides works by Bach and Mozart and a recent work by the British composer Oliver Knussen, he will play keyboard pieces by Renaissance composers: Josquin, John Bull and John Dowland. 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212)707-8787, free; two tickets per person are available at the box office starting at noon. (Tommasini)    MARK STEINBERG AND MITSUKO UCHIDA (Tomorrow) Mozart's Violin Sonatas can sound uncharacteristically stolid, but if anyone can bring them to life it's Mark Steinberg, a brilliantly quirky violinist, and Mitsuko Uchida, one of today's most lyrical pianists. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $48 and $64. (Allan Kozinn)    CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF AND LEIF OVE ANDSNES (Wednesday) Mr. Tetzlaff, the violinist, and Mr. Andsnes, the pianist, get together for a conventional evening of sonatas, from Beethoven to Grieg. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $25 to $84.

More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, historic New England, from a box with two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait. Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000. (Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness.

Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4.

This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Víctor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with Revolutionary heros and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272.

The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000.

With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through January 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snaphot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30: A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION Despite a fairly inchoate assemblage of contemporary art on the second floor, the early story of modernism is now retold in an installation about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'SURREALISM USA,' through May 8. Surrealism shook American arts, and this high-spirited exhibition examines the fallout with a wide-angle lens. It presents 120 works by more than 60 artists, from Europeans in exile to Abstract Expressionists to the often forgotten. 1083 Fifth Avenue near 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'BYRDCLIFFE: AN AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS COLONY,' through May 15. In its heyday this colony for artists, musicians and writers in Woodstock, N.Y., produced rugged, elegantly designed Arts and Crafts furniture, plus pottery, painting, jewelry, metalwork and textiles. The colony's spirit pervades the show in photographs and other memorabilia. 170 Central Park West, at 76th Street, (212)873-3400, through May 15. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of a community museum begun in 1976. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CY TWOMBLY: FIFTY YEARS OF WORKS ON PAPER,' through May 8. Despite the title, this is basically a show of paintings. It starts in the 1950's, with a personal anti-aesthetic in which scribbling was draftsmanship, and gouging and scratching were gestural painting. After a move to Italy, words appeared. Later the work turns lush, into a kind of horticultural expressionism that is appetizing and uningratiating. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Cotter)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-24538639. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    PETER HOWSON, 'CHRISTOS ANESTE' Working with a sharp pencil on small square panels in a profusely detailed, expressionistic and sometimes hallucinatory style that harks back to the Northern Renaissance, this British artist brings impressive skill and tragicomic verve to subjects like the trials of Jesus, the temptation of St. Anthony and the delusions of Don Quixote. Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue at 77th Street, (212)439-1700, through May 7. (Johnson)    JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through June 4. (Johnson)    * WAYNE THIEBAUD 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, through May 27. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    THOMAS STRUTH: 'AUDIENCE' Handsome new photographs and an alternately tedious, exhilarating video examine the aesthetic experience in terms of space and time from the point of view of the audience, ourselves actively included. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through May 7. (Smith)    Galleries: SoHo    * '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLIMT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' This fascinating and beautiful show presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'JUTTA KOETHER' A small survey of a German-born New York painter whose graffiti-inspired brushwork, fluorescent palette, fragmented images and heavy-duty quotations define her medium as defiantly multipurpose. It provides pleasure, incites thought and questions assumptions about taste and technique. Thomas Erben, 516 West 20th Street, (212)645-8701, through May 7. (Smith)    SAM KUSACK: 'PHASE THREE: SUBSTRATES' Mr. Kusack's sleek industrial fountain of cut-out aluminum, metal tubing and a supposedly real meteorite is like a prop for a science fiction movie. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through May 14. (Johnson)    JONAS MEKAS: 'FRAGMENTS OF PARADISE' This retrospective sampler of a revered member of the New York avant-garde film community presents short and long, typically low-production, diaristic films from the last five decades on video screens. Also, a cacophonous, 12-monitor installation shows 24 hours in the life of the artist and his family. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212)366-1549, through May 14. (Johnson)    'NEOCON' This soberly handsome, eight-artist show bets you can be hip and conservative at the same time. It includes portraits by Matthew Cerletty and Christoph Ruckhaberle; a gray and white semi-abstraction by Robert Moskowitz; a compact, colorfully explosive collage by Kristin Baker; and Kevin Zucker's elegant, cut-out photograph of louvered blinds. Gavin Brown's Enterprise at Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, (212)206-7321, through May 12. (Johnson)    DAVID RATCLIFF Digitally processed montages of mass-media imagery are converted into hand-cut stencils, to create hallucinatory, two-tone spray paintings, finessing the gap between Pop and Surrealism. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212)279-9219, through May 7. (Johnson)    ANGELA STRASSHEIM: 'LEFT BEHIND' The large, extraordinarily vivid color photographs in this New York solo debut have a subtly gripping archetypal magic. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212)627-3363, through May 14. (Johnson)    JOAN WALLACE, 'VIOLENT POP PAINTINGS' Each of three videos set into white monochrome panels shows a white-frosted cake exploded in slow motion by a shotgun blast. Ms. Wallace invites us to read this as a commentary on Modernist purity, the shooting of Andy Warhol and the assassination of President Kennedy. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212)947-2818, through May 28. (Johnson)    MEGAN WHITMARSH: 'FOREST LOGIC' Ms. Whitmarsh embroiders tiny images of elves, yetis, gorillas, mushrooms, modern sculptures and rock bands all over rectangles of colored fabric, to charmingly goofy effect. Sixtyseven, 547 West 27th Street, (212)967-2260, through May 7. (Johnson)    JIM WRIGHT: 'TWO COATS FOR THE TEMPERANCE REEL' In thick, glossy, candy-colored acrylics, Mr. Wright paints big neo-hippie pictures of guitars, musicians, magic forests and totemic animals. In the rear gallery, Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through May 14. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ALEXANDER THE GREAT: TREASURES FROM AN EPIC ERA OF HELLENISM,' Alexander (356-323 B.C.) and his age are evoked in this concentrated show of art and artifacts displaying portrait busts of the legendary Macedonian emperor, ancient coins, advanced Macedonian weaponry and pottery. Onassis Cultural Center, 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)486-4448, through May 28. (Glueck)    * ALBERTO CASADO: 'TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, (212)219-0473, through June 25. (Johnson)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, which has meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, Meatpacking District, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style. City Hall Park, (212)980-4575, through October. (Johnson)    Last Chance    LARRY BURROWS: 'WAR AND PEACE' Before he was lost in a helicopter over Laos in 1971, Burrows produced images in Vietnam that are among the most beautiful and moving war photographs made. This selection of 27 pictures includes a number of those, as well as more conventional news photographs. Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212)397-3930, through tomorrow. (Johnson)    DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'FIRST SEEN: PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLES, 1840-1880,' through Sunday. About 250 pictures from the vast archives of the Wilson Center for Photography in London depict ''first'' glimpses of people, rather than the more usual landscapes, mountains or relics that were easier subjects for the pioneer cameras. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212)759-0606. (Glueck)    'IN BLACK AND WHITE' This ecumenical group show follows its color scheme across the party lines separating generations, mediums, styles and cliques. Among the standouts is an unusually de Kooningesque 1950's oil-on-board by Ad Reinhardt and an assertive bust of a woman by Louisa Matthiasdottir. Lori Bookstein Fine Art, 37 West 57th Street, (212)750-0949, through today. (Smith)    'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: SELF-PORTRAITS' A bracing display of ambitious, self-deprecating and in some ways tragic self-portraits rarely seen in the United States, by the German bad-boy artist whose reputation and influence have been expanding since his death in 1997. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-9100, through tomorrow. (Smith)    MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, SYROS, PARIS BAR, AND DAWSON CITY' Concentrating on far-flung earthworks commissioned by the owners of a Berlin art bar named for the French capital, this exhibition corrals many of the German artist's so-called side lines, including drawings and watercolors. They capture quite a bit of his raucous, free-range sensibility. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, 8D, (212)473-4447, through tomorrow. (Smith)    * 'YVES KLEIN: AIR ARCHITECTURE,' through April 30. The French conceptualist Yves Klein (1928-62) is best known for his monochromatic blue paintings. But he was also interested in design, including architecture, the subject of this exhilarating show. Storefront for Art and Architecture, 97 Kenmare Street, , (212)431-5795, through tomorrow. (Cotter)    EDWARD LIPSKI Working in blackened cake, animal fur, sequins and old concert flyers, an English sculptor makes his debut with polymorphous figurative sculptures that aim for the solar plexus, but too often achieve little more than a well-crafted sense of free-floating malfeasance and familiar Surrealist frisson. Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, 730 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212)445-0444, through tomorrow. (Smith)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' through Sunday. Fra Carnevale is known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both are in this intricate show, which displays his paintings with some by figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca to explore ideas about professional identity in a diverse cultural epoch. (See above.) (Cotter).    JEAN-PAUL RIOPELLE Riopelle was once widely celebrated for his suave, European version of Abstract Expressionism. This show presents paintings with thickly palette-knifed surfaces from the 50's and 60's. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)366-4774, through tomorrow.

5," When Dr. Alan Schiller's 87-year-old mother died in January, ''it took some convincing,'' Schiller says, to get his siblings to agree to an autopsy. ''They said: 'She had Alzheimer's. Let her rest.' But I told them: 'No, something seems funny to me. An autopsy is the only way to be sure.''' Schiller prevailed. A tanned, quick-minded, gregarious man in his 60's, he is naturally persuasive, and as chairman of pathology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, he carries a certain authority regarding autopsies. The word ''autopsy,'' he reminded his siblings, means to ''see for oneself,'' and they should see what happened to their mother. Schiller's mother died in Miami, so he called his friend Dr. Robert Poppiti Jr., chairman of pathology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was on the table the next morning.     In a living patient, Alzheimer's is a diagnosis of exclusion, one that should ideally be reached only by eliminating all testable causes of fading memory and mind. Confirming it requires directly examining the brain. The definitive markers are the tiny protein plaques and fibrous tangles that appear under the microscope in stained sections. But a good pathologist can spot advanced Alzheimer's just by looking at the whole brain. The brain will be shorter, front to back, and more squarish than normal -- a reflection of Alzheimer's neuronal decimation, which shrinks the brain up to 15 percent. This would presumably have been the case with Mrs. Schiller. But the autopsist found her brain of normal shape and size. Dissecting it, he discovered a half-dozen cystlike lesions scattered throughout -- areas darker, softer and less elastic than the buff-colored parts surrounding them.

'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Opens May 1. The ''Death of a Salesman'' for our time receives its first Broadway revival (1:45). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' Opens May 2. ''Spellbound'' set to music -- with more jokes. (1:45). Circle In the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'SWEET CHARITY' Opens May 4. Christina Applegate stars (for now) in a revival of the musical by Cy Coleman and Dorothy Fields (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.

'MEMORY HOUSE' Starts previews today. Opens May 17. Dianne Wiest stars as mother of girl looking for answers about her adoption. (1:30) Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Jerry Zaks's revival of the 1983 musical often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers(2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are on a rampage in Daniel Sullivan's carnage-happy interpretation of Shakespeare's tragedy. Dripping blood and breathing smoke, these specters are chewing up everything in their path: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, the play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' Staged by David Leveaux, this revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea through which people swim slowly and blindly. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. But the show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as a middle-aged American abroad (2:15). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a supsected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and longtime Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' In Robert Harling's freeze-dried comedy, people speak in the kinds of sentences that wind up embroidered on decorative pillows. But despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, directed by Anthony Page and starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING' Cheers to the British cabaret trio that calls itself Fascinating Aida. These women revel in the here and now. They are bawdy and political; loopy (in that crisp English way) and whimsical (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Margo Jefferson)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry. She needs to verify the authenticity of a few ""confiscated"" works, for a public bonfire of degenerate art (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)    'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE FALSE SERVANT' Decked out in a smart black tailcoat and shiny leather boots, her hair styled in a sleek blond cap, Martha Plimpton cuts a debonair figure in this revival of this unusually chilly Marivaux comedy. Ms. Plimpton's dashing performance imbues the proceedings with a bright, puckish spirit, but the but mechanical staging emphasizes the nip that never leaves the air (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    'FAUST IN LOVE' The Target Margin Theater's take on Goethe's metaphysical epic of a professor selling his soul to the devil for knowledge comes off with all the sophistication of an over-long ''Saturday Night Live'' skit (1:15). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)358-3657. (Phoebe Hoban)    'HOT 'N' THROBBING' I'm not sure if Paula Vogel's play is a comedy about domestic abuse or a tragedy about the effects of pornography, but the fact that a good argument could be made for either (or both) says something about the ambitions of this curious, clever and often frustrating jumble of a play about a mother of two who pays the bills by writing adult-film screenplays (1:30). Signature Theater Company, 555 West 42nd Street, (212)244-7529. (Jason Zinoman)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That would appear to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in the New Group's smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific, uncompromising cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters on stage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive than they actually are if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind ''Lazer Vaudeville,'' a hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MOONLIGHT AND MAGNOLIAS' Hollywood ghosts squabble like starving chickens in Ron Hutchinson's shrill, obstreperously silly comedy about the making of ''Gone With the Wind.'' Taking her cue from Mr. Hutchinson's antic approach, Lynne Meadow directs the proceedings with riding crop in hand (1:50). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)    'MONK' Rome Neal eases his way through this solo play about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, taking his time to tell the story of an artist he clearly loves. But this is not the show for jazz fans that want to delve deep into Monk's psychology or learn something new about his process (1:30). Havoc, 312 West 36th Street, (718)288-8048. (Zinoman)    'ORANGE FLOWER WATER' Craig Wright's play is about two marriages coming apart. The hurt that people cause one another is communicated only through words in this play -- sometimes too many of them (1:30). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)868-4444. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side-effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BONNIE PARKER' There is probably a lot of rich material in the psyche of Parker, who made her name as the bank-robbing partner of Clyde Barrow, but in her deadly one-woman show, Dixie Lee Sedgwick gives her audience only a one-dimensional character, a young Texas woman who is bored before she meets Barrow and dissatisfied afterward (2:00). John Houseman Studio Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, (212)868-4444. (Anita Gates)    'ROMANCE' In the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, David Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either (1:35). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories from the mid-19th century, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100 . (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SOULS OF NAPLES' As a lovable dupe who is happier tangling with a family of phantoms than facing the cold truths of his marriage, John Turturro exudes a winsome sincerity that pleasantly perfumes Roman Paska's otherwise flaccid production of this 1946 comedy by Eduardo De Filippo (2:00). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' A surprisingly mischievous rendering of George Bernard Shaw's first play, an 1892 bit of social criticism masquerading as a love story (2:15). 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, (212)598-9802. (Genzlinger)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200 (Isherwood).    Off Off Broadway    'THE AUDIENCE' Conceived and directed by Jack Cummings III, the show has been assembled from contributions by a few dozen writers, composers and lyricists. While there are moments both sentimental and funny here, most of the contributors seem to have obeyed an official mandate to stick strictly to stereotype (1:40). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101 (Isherwood).    'FINNEGANS WAKE' The idea of basing a musical on James Joyce's epic and near-impenetrable feast of language sounds perilously close to material for a skit on ''Saturday Night Live.'' But to the credit of Barbara Vann, who adapted the piece for the stage, her Medicine Show Theater Ensemble presents pure Joyce (2:30). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette).    'FIT TO KILL' It takes a certain type of actor to pull off comic noir, but someone forgot to tell whoever cast ''Fit to Kill,'' a who's-going-to-murder-whom thriller (2:00) . Clurman, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large transvestite (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley).    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). 47th Street, 304 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BELFAST BLUES' Geraldine Hughes's solo show is a heartfelt and funny if unexceptional stage memoir (1:25). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'CALIGULA.' Playing the famously vainglorious Roman ruler Caligula reinvented as a postmodern actor-cum-director, gasbag moralist and irreverent critic of biographies about himself, Andre De Shields is phenomenal (1:25). Classical Theater of Harlem, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb)    'DECO DIVA' Kara Wilson plays the Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka, living in Paris in 1939. In the course of the play, Ms. Wilson paints a copy of Lempicka's ''Beautiful Rafaela,'' which feels like a parlor trick but adds needed texture to this stylish but lightweight work (1:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    * 'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' This show is a typical Richard Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological-Hysteric at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650, closing on Sunday. (Brantley).    'GOING TO ST. IVES' Questions of life and death are probed and settled over pots of tea in Lee Blessing's thoughtful, tidy two-hander. But if the play's structural and thematic niceties are intellectually pleasing, they also imbue it with a hollow, manufactured quality (2:00). 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Audience members strong enough to sit through this jukebox show will discover that the production does have a reason to be. ''Good Vibrations'' sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good (2:15). O'Neill, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'LUNA' At the New Victory, no vaudevillians are juggling fire; rather, greater daring is on display by the Belgian troupe Pantalone: original chamber music for kindergartners. Accompanied only by a narrator, this is more multi-media concert than theater, with narrative music that dances wildly when devils fight (1:30). 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Miriam Horn)    'PLAY IN A PUB' As a wry young Frenchwoman, Kelli Holsopple persuades you that you are not in a bar in the East Village watching Romulus Linney's one-act play ''Can Can,'' but in France, with her. The evening opens with ''A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot,'' a burlesque by Tennessee Williams about two lonely women of a certain age (1:30). Bacchus Room, Bona Fides Restaurant, 60 Second Avenue, at Third Street, (212)352-3101, closing on Thursday. (Andrea Stevens)    'THIS IS HOW IT GOES' Ben Stiller, famous in movies as an everyklutz, is the ideal guide for escorting audiences through the slippery maze of Neil LaBute's extended ploy of a play. In this story of an interracial romantic triangle, Mr. Stiller gives an artfully layered, deceptive performance that leaves you thinking it's a pity he had to portray a moral construct instead of a character (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'WHAT OF THE NIGHT' A solo show starring Jane Alexander as Djuna Barnes, the literary adventurer best known for her spooky modernist novel ''Nightwood,'' this curio combines some of the standard facets of dead-celebrity stage plays with the more rarefied and often inscrutable behaviors endemic in the world of performance art (1:15). Lortel, 121 Christopher Street, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    'WHEN THE BULBUL STOPPED SINGING' This s a one-man, one-note chronicle of the events beginning on March 29, 2002, when Israeli troops invaded Ramallah and surrounded Yasir Arafat's headquarters. The Scottish playwright David Greig's simplistic account of this enormously complex situation does a disservice to both sides (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Hoban)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' (G, 48 minutes). A hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome. (Stephen Holden)    'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes). Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Manohla Dargis)    'BEAUTY SHOP' (PG-13, 105 minutes). Less a sequel than an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff, this loose and genial comedy moves the ''Barbershop'' franchise to Atlanta, and gives the ladies a turn at the warm, salty banter that made the first two installments so popular (A.O. Scott)    'THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE' (R, 112 minutes). A proud survivor of the 1960's and its utopian promise, Jack (Daniel Day-Lewis) lives alone on an island with his only daughter. A story about the limits of love, ''Ballad'' is also about the limits of idealism as well as, rather unfortunately, those of its restlessly ambitious writer and director, Rebecca Miller. (Dargis)    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali), A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta (Scott).    'BE COOL' (PG-13, 112 minutes). John Travolta returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in ''Get Shorty,'' which arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction.'' But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty (Dargis)    * 'THE BEST OF YOUTH' (not rated, six hours and 23 minutes, shown in two parts; in Italian). Marco Tullio Giordana's six-hour journey through recent Italian history is nothing less than a masterpiece, combining epic sweep with precise, heart-rending intimacy. (Scott)    'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' (PG-13, 111 minutes). This Bollywood-style musical -- which transposes Jane Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. (Dargis)    'CONSTANTINE' (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Keanu Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. (Scott)    'DEAD AND BREAKFAST' (not rated, 88 minutes). Matthew Leutwyler's horror movie about six young people trapped in a creepy small town goes for parody and fails. There is no suspense or real fun but tons of gore. (Anita Gates)    'DOWNFALL' (not rated, 155 minutes; in German). Bruno Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses. The film's most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. (Scott)    'EATING OUT' (not rated, 85 minutes). A dreary erotic roundelay: a modern-day variant on a Shakespeare comedy, only without the verbal felicity or sense of dramatic structure. (Dana Stevens)    * 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)    '15' (not rated, 90 minutes, in Hokkien and Mandarin). A Singaporean film about the desultory adventures of a gang of disaffected youth starring young non professional actors who aren't any good. (Stevens)    * 'GUNNER PALACE' (PG-13, 86 minutes). Raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary about American soldiers in Iraq than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. (Scott)    'GUESS WHO' (PG-13, 103 minutes). A loose, pointless remake of ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' (Scott)    'HAPPILY EVER AFTER' (not rated, 100 minutes; in French). A likable skin-deep sex comedy, which tries half-heartedly to present itself as a treatise on marriage. (Holden)    * 'HEAD-ON' (not rated, 118 minutes; in German and Turkish). This film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of 2005. (Dargis)    'HITCH' (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Will Smith as a dating coach. (Scott)    'HOSTAGE' (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero. (Holden)    'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes). Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)    'IN MY COUNTRY' (R, 104 minutes). Juliette Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of this high-minded but hopelessly wooden film. (Holden)    'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' (NC-17, 90 minutes). A lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary about Linda Lovelace, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat.'' (Dargis)    'IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG' (R, 88 minutes). A dance club D.J. loses his hearing and then his grip in this surprisingly sweet faux documentary, while Paul Kaye keeps us interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless. (Dargis)    'THE JACKET' (R, 102 minutes). Adrien Brody plays Jack Starks, who is sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. (Scott)    'KONTROLL' (R, 106 minutes; in Hungarian). Shot entirely in the Budapest subway system, Nimrod Antal's debut film is a grungy, shaggy-dog allegory -- a stylish, meandering trip to nowhere in particular. (Scott)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese). This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French). A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MELINDA AND MELINDA' (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though Woody Allen's drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, the director interweaves them deftly enough. (Scott)    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' (PG-13, 135 minutes). Clint Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. (Scott)    * 'MILLIONS' (PG, 97 minutes). Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Danny Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. (Dargis)    'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. (Dargis)    'MONDOVINO' (Not rated, 131 minutes). This documentary about the effects of globalization on the making and consumption of wine is full of beautiful landscapes and challenging ideas, but it is also repetitious, tendentious and much too long. (Scott)    'ODESSA ... ODESSA!' (not rated, 96 minutes). Most of the people who gather to reminisce and sing the old songs in this mournful, slowly paced cinematic poem are Jewish exiles from the decrepit Ukrainian city, which they remember as paradise. (Holden)    'OLD BOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean). The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge (Dargis).    'THE PACIFIER' (PG, 97 minutes). Despite the specter of boogeymen, this new family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. (Ned Martel)    'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes). The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'PERLASCA' (not rated, 104 minutes; in Italian). In Hungary in 1944, Giorgio Perlasca saved the lives of thousands of Jews, and his memory deserves better than this inept Italian television film. (Gates)    'THE RING TWO' (PG-13, 111 minutes). In ''The Ring,'' Rachel (Naomi Watts), a journalist and single mom, escaped the marauding ghost in the machine, and she now thinks she has entered a new chapter. No such luck; she is actually mucking about on a slag heap of recycled scares, dumb lines and predictable entanglements. (Dargis)    'RAGING DOVE' (not rated, 70 minutes). A bruising but illuminating documentary considers how nationalism flattened one young, sure-footed boxer, who was born in Nazareth to a Palestinian family. (Martel)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes). This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SAVE THE GREEN PLANET' (not rated, 118 minutes; in Korean). A dog named Earth and aliens both domestic and imported rotate around one another in this self-consciously freaky, rambunctiously goofy genre hybrid from South Korea. Just don't ask what it all means. (Dargis)    * 'SCHIZO' (not rated, 86 minutes, in Russian). This modest neo-realist film from Kazhakstan is both tough and tender. As the movie follows the conventions of a crime-tinged coming-of-age story, it achieves a rough, convincing poetry. (Scott)    'SHORT CUT TO NIRVANA: KUMBH MELA' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Hindi). Seventy million pilgrims gather in India to seek enlightenment; this engaging documentary travelogue, as the title suggests, will save you the trip. (Scott)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes). Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    'STATE PROPERTY II' (R, 94 minutes). Better than the first one, which isn't saying much, but this brutal celebration of the spirit of capitalism has some moments of energy and wit. (Scott)    * 'TORREMOLINOS 73' (not rated, 91 minutes, in Spanish). This movie's gentle, humanist vision of pornographic filmmaking as a sexual and aesthetic act of emancipation is a far cry from the graphic social realism of recent films like ''A Hole in My Heart.'' (Stevens)    'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen to do some marvelous work. (Scott)    'WINNING GIRLS THROUGH PSYCHIC MIND CONTROL' (not rated, 93 minutes). Sam (Ruben Santiago-Hudson) suddenly develops psychic powers in this likable but only sporadically funny comedy. (Gates)    'WINTER SOLSTICE' (R, 93 minutes). This is the kind of ambling, event-free family drama that will either draw audiences in with its understated power, or quietly bore them out of their skulls. (Stevens)    Film Series    'DAVID CROSS SELECTS' (through Sunday). In a break from its usual highbrow lineup, the Anthology Film Archives offers a week's worth of films guest-curated by the comedian David Cross. One seldom-seen gem from his wildly eclectic list is ''Chilly Scenes of Winter,'' Joan Micklin Silver's 1979 adaptation of an Ann Beattie novel. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212)505-5181; $8.

By popular demand, Film Forum has rescheduled a one-day-only screening of the uncut version of ''Baby Face,'' the notorious 1933 film in which a young Barbara Stanwyck climbs the corporate ladder, one man at a time. This slightly longer (and much tawdrier) version will be followed by a screening of clips from the censored version, for comparison's sake. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8112; $10 (Stevens).    'THE 12TH NEW YORK AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL' (Wednesday through April 28). Along with a screening of last year's breakout hit ''Moolaade,'' this year's festival features ''Al'Leessi An African Actress,'' a documentary about the Nigerian actress Zalika Souley, who made her name in the 1960's playing bad-girl desperadoes in an atmosphere of strict Muslim repression. Walter Reade, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600; $10. (Stevens)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ADULT (Thursday and next Friday).

(Ratliff)    DAFNIS PRIETO ABSOLUTE QUINTET, (Tonight and tomorrow) This drummer's music is some of the best within New York's new Latin-jazz movement, distinguished by complex, jaggedly modern writing, but also by a deep cultural literacy of Cuban folklore; this new group includes the saxophonist Yosvany Terry, the pianist Jason Lindner, the violinist Alan Grubner and the cellist Catherine Bent. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $15 per set.

(Ratliff)    * CLARK TERRY QUINTET, (Tonight and tomorrow) It's possible that no other jazz musician has as much amusing old-guy charm as Mr. Terry, and when you think he's all sweetness, he'll rattle you profoundly with a cool, beautifully executed piece of fluegelhorn playing. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue at 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253; cover, $40.

(Ratliff)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' (Tonight, Monday, Thursday) There is less of Deborah Voigt than there has been for a long time, but the voice is as big and imposing as ever. 8 p.m. tonight, 7:30 Monday and Thursday, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $200. (Bernard Holland)    'THE BARTERED BRIDE' (Wednesday) Students at the Juilliard School hope to have a good time with Smetana's wonderful evocation of rural Central European life and music. 8 p.m., Juilliard Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $20, $10 for students and 65+. (Holland)    'CARMEN' (Sunday) Gary Thor Wedow conducts, John Bellemer is Don José and Katharine Goeldner sings the title role in Jonathan Eaton's handsome production of the Bizet favorite. (This is the final performance of the season.) 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570, sold out but returns may be available. (Jeremy Eichler)    'LA FANCIULLA DEL WEST' (Tomorrow) Conventional wisdom has it that Puccini's Wild West opera doesn't have enough hit tunes; but the human awkwardness of its characters could be another reason it's not as popular as ''Tosca.'' But for this music, it's worth overlooking the singing Indians. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570, $32 to $115. (Anne Midgette)    'FAUST' (Tuesday) The Metropolitan Opera has the starriest of casts for its new ''Faust,'' though Roberto Alagna sings opposite Soile Isokoski, the fine but rather cool Finnish soprano, rather than his wife and usual singing partner, Angela Gheorghiu. The role of Valentin may lie a bit high for the voice of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, and surely there are better uses for René Pape's velvety bass, but these high-octane singers may blow away all doubts, especially with James Levine in the pit to help them. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available at the box office. (Midgette)    'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) The essentials of Puccini's opera -- the tragedy of a geisha who took her marriage to an American naval officer seriously when he didn't -- are well served by Mark Lamos's spare production at City Opera. The cast includes Marc Heller as Pinkerton and Jee Hyun Lim as Butterfly. Atsushi Yamada conducts. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, (212)870-5570, $32 to $115. (Allan Kozinn)    'LES PÊCHEURS DE PERLES' (Tonight) Zandra Rhodes's brightly colored sets in this new City Opera production evoke the opening ceremonies at an Olympic Games. The singing is O.K. but for all its beautiful music, this is an opera in which not much happens but takes a long time to do it. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570, sold out. (Midgette)    'TURANDOT' (Wednesday) Franco Zeffirelli's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to stage direction reaches its apotheosis with this opulent production, which by this point in the year has become somewhat routine. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $170. (Midgette)    'DIE WALKÜRE' (Tomorrow) For Met fans accustomed to James Levine's probing performances of Wagner, Valery Gergiev's approach to ''Die Walküre'' will seem a notable change: more rhapsodic, less structural, fleeter over all, though less sublime than Mr. Levine's at its best. The cast includes several fine singers from Mr. Gergiev's home company, the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg. The tireless Plácido Domingo sings Siegmund. 12:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $40 to $215. (Anthony Tommasini)    'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tomorrow) Julie Taymor's new production of Mozart's fairy-tale opera ''Die Zauberflöte'' has proven a crowd pleaser. But the production is so packed with nonstop stage effects, so overly busy, and so peopled with dancers, gargantuan puppets and kite-like animals of every sort that the fine musical performances take a back seat to the stage show. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available at the box office. (Tommasini)    Classical Music    AUGUSTUS ARNONE (Thursday) An obviously brave young pianist tackles music to perk up the ears, by Debussy, Elliott Carter, David Rakowski and Roberto Sierra. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $12.

There are works by Mendelssohn, Bartok and Beethoven. 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)586-4680, $9.

(Tommasini)    CHANTICLEER (Tonight) This remarkable all-male, 12-voice a cappella choir turns its attention to the opposite sex tonight at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Titled ''Women, Saintly and Otherwise,'' the program of works from the Renaissance (Josquin and Victoria) to the 20th century (Poulenc) is described as a ''tribute to woman as ruler, composer, muse and creator.'' 8 p.m., Temple of Dendur, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949, sold out, but returns may be available at the box office.

(Oestreich)    EMPIRE VIOLS (Tonight) It's a groaner of a pun, ''Senfl Pleasures,'' but if that's what it takes to get music of Ludwig Senfl (not to mention Andreas Hammerschmidt and David Funck) on the boards, so be it. 8 p.m., Second Presbyterian Church, 6 West 96th Street, (917)363-2646, $10. (Oestreich)    BRIAN FERNEYHOUGH (Tonight) This British composer applies his spiky, intensely focused style to Piranesi's eerie ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' engravings in a chamber work of the same name that may be a quirkily twisted ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' for our time. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799, $20. (Kozinn)    JOSE FRANCH-BALLESTER (Tuesday) This Spanish clarinetist, born in 1980, has already won more awards and competitions than any young artist could hope for, including the First Prize in the 2004 Young Concert Artists International Auditions. That invaluable organization presents this promising new artist in an adventurous recital of works by Messager, Chausson, Brahms, Bassi and Kenji Bunch. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, at Lexington Avenue, (212)307-6656, $20 and $30. (Tommasini)    HILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Wednesday) Bach and Arvo Pärt may prove congenial partners in prayer in this fine vocal ensemble's program of sacred works, split between these Baroque and post-Minimalist masters. 8 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212)721-6500, $45. (Kozinn)    JENNIFER KOH (Thursday) She's a fiery young violinist with a special flare for contemporary music. For this recital, she plays works by Esa-Pekka Salonen and John Adams contrasted with music by Schumann, Schubert and Ravel. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949, $20, $10 for students. (Eichler)    ROBERT LEVIN (Thursday) The pianist and musicologist wears both hats at once in his ''Mozart Explained'' series of concerts with commentary.

(Eichler)    BRUCE LEVINGSTON (Monday) Chuck Close's portrait of Philip Glass has become one of the best-known images of the composer; now Mr. Glass repays the favor with ''A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close,'' the opener of Bruce Levingston's piano recital, which it shares with music by Brahms, Schumann, Debussy, Liszt and Messiaen. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $25 to $150.

(Kozinn)    'MOVING PATTERNS: ELECTRONIC MUSIC AND BEYOND' (Tuesday through next Saturday) It has been a long way from the 1960's, when electronic works were collections of pings, bops and buzzes. This festival of recent Austrian works takes in pieces that draw on everything from the eerie sound of the theremin to up-to-date computer scores and film soundtracks. Tuesday at 7:15 p.m.; Wednesday, Friday and next Saturday at 7 p.m.; Thursday at 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)319 5300, free.

(Holland)    VOICES OF ASCENSION (Tuesday) An evening of spirituality and mysticism is what's promised, so a logical place to start is with John Tavener, who has developed a New Age-y take on Orthodox religion. And for this chorus's 15th anniverary season, James Bassi has written a new work. 8 p.m., Church of the Ascension, Fifth Avenue at 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212)358-1469.

Museums    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times are used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. The show is a valuable essay on the very notion of traditions: how they are formed, perpetuated, renewed, exploited or exhausted. Central Park West at 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Grace Glueck)    * ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India, embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism.

Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000. (Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000.

Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'FIRST SEEN: PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLES, 1840-1880,' through May 1. About 250 pictures from the vast archives of the Wilson Center for Photography in London depict ''first'' glimpses of people, rather than the more usual landscapes, mountains or relics that were easier subjects for the pioneer cameras. The profusion can cause the viewer's mind to boggle, but it gives a good idea of the worldwide sweep of the earliest camera lens. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212)759-0606.

For his solo show, Mr. Tiravanija built a low-power television station from inexpensive materials and papered the gallery's walls with instructions on how anyone and everyone can do the same, raising issues of government control and First Amendment rights. 1071 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through January 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above) (Cotter)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' through May 1. Fra Carnevale is known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both are in this intricate show, which shows his paintings with some by figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca to explore ideas about professional identity in a diverse cultural epoch. (See above.) (Cotter).    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30: A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman).    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION Despite a fairly inchoate assemblage of contemporary art on the second floor, the early story of modernism is now retold in an installation about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. (See above.) (Kimmelman).    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'SURREALISM USA,' through May 8. Surrealism shook American arts, and this high-spirited exhibition examines the fallout with a wide-angle lens. It presents 120 works by more than 60 artists, from Europeans in exile to Abstract Expressionists to the often forgotten. 1083 Fifth Avenue near 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith).    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck).    NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers, among them Lotte Jacobi, Josef Albers, Gisele Freund, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and August Sander. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck).    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of a community museum begun in 1976. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CY TWOMBLY: FIFTY YEARS OF WORKS ON PAPER,' through May 8. Despite the title, this is basically a show of paintings. It starts in the 1950's, with a personal anti-aesthetic in which scribbling was draftsmanship, and gouging and scratching were gestural painting. After a move to Italy, words appeared. Later the work turns lush, into a kind of horticultural expressionism that is appetizing and uningratiating. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Cotter)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. (See above.) (Kimmelman).    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-24538639. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    PETER HOWSON, 'CHRISTOS ANESTE' Working with a sharp pencil on small square panels in a profusely detailed, expressionistic and sometimes hallucinatory style that harks back to the Northern Renaissance, this British artist brings impressive skill and tragicomic verve to subjects like the trials of Jesus, the temptation of St. Anthony and the delusions of Don Quixote. Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue at 77th Street, (212)439-1700, through May 7. (Johnson)    * WAYNE THIEBAUD 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, through May 27. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'IN BLACK AND WHITE' This ecumenical group show follows its color scheme across the party lines separating generations, mediums, styles and cliques. Among the standouts is an unusually de Kooning-like 1950's oil-on-board by Ad Reinhardt and an assertive bust of a woman by Louisa Matthiasdottir. Lori Bookstein Fine Art, 37 West 57th Street, (212)750-0949, through April 29. (Smith)    LARRY BURROWS ''War and Peace,'' Before he was lost in a helicopter over Laos in 1971, Burrows produced images in Vietnam that are among the most beautiful and moving war photographs made. This selection of 27 pictures includes a number of those, as well as more conventional news photographs. Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212)397-3930, through April 30. (Johnson)    'SERIOUS NONSENSE: THE IMAGERY OF BRUCE McCALL' If Fred Astaire had made paintings in his spare time, perhaps they would have looked like the smooth and witty, 1940's-style gouaches of Mr. McCall, a contributor to The New Yorker and other magazines. James Goodman, 41 East 57th Street, (212)593-3737, through April 30. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    * '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLIMT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' This fascinating and beautiful show presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'HAVING DIFFERENCES' A lively selection of seven young Los Angeles artists, includes Jacob Melchi's hilarious, hand-printed stories about art world people; Eduardo Sarabia's fake ''stolen'' vases; and Marie Jager's zany android movie. I-20, 529 West 20th Street, (212)645-1100, through April 30. (Johnson)    'IAN KIAER: THE GREY CLOTH' Five installation pieces work as a neurasthenic environment whose pale monochromes and found objects abjectly elegize the building blocks of modernism. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery 521 West 21st Street, (212)414-4144, through April 30. (Smith)    'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: SELF-PORTRAITS' A bracing display of ambitious, self-deprecating and in some ways tragic self-portraits rarely seen in the United States, by the German bad-boy artist whose reputation and influence have been expanding since his death in 1997. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212)206-9100, through April 30. (Smith)    'JUTTA KOETHER' A small survey of a German-born New York painter whose graffiti-inspired brushwork, fluorescent palette, fragmented images and heavy-duty quotations define her medium as defiantly multipurpose. It provides pleasure, incites thought and questions assumptions about taste and technique. Thomas Erben, 516 West 20th Street, (212)645-8701, through May 7. (Smith)    JONAS MEKAS: 'FRAGMENTS OF PARADISE' This retrospective sampler of a revered member of the New York avant-garde film community presents short and long, typically low-production, diaristic films from the last five decades on video screens. Also, a cacophonous, 12-monitor installation shows 24 hours in the life of the artist and his family. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212)366-1549, through May 14. (Johnson)    DAVID RATCLIFF Digitally processed montages of mass-media imagery are converted into hand-cut stencils, to create hallucinatory, two-tone spray paintings, finessing the gap between Pop and Surrealism. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212)279-9219, through May 7. (Johnson)    ANGELA STRASSHEIM: 'LEFT BEHIND' The large, extraordinarily vivid color photographs in this New York solo debut have a subtly gripping archetypal magic. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212)627-3363, through April 30. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ALEXANDER THE GREAT: TREASURES FROM AN EPIC ERA OF HELLENISM,' Alexander (356-323 B.C.) and his age are evoked in this concentrated show of art and artifacts displaying portrait busts of the legendary Macedonian emperor, ancient coins, advanced Macedonian weaponry and pottery. Onassis Cultural Center, 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)486-4448, through May 28. (Glueck)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, which has meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, Meatpacking District, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    JEFF HAND, 'THE SHADOW OF DOUBT' This Nashville conceptualist's comic art-about-art includes a de Kooning ''Woman'' remade from carpet scraps; a Motherwell bathmat; and a revolving, fur-lined teacup. Plus Ultra, 235 South First Street, Williamsburg, (718)387-3844, through April 25. (Johnson)    MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, SYROS, PARIS BAR, AND DAWSON CITY' Concentrating on far-flung earthworks commissioned by the owners of a Berlin art bar named for the French capital, this exhibition corrals many of the German artist's so-called side lines, including drawings and watercolors. They capture quite a bit of his raucous, free-range sensibility. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, 8D, (212)473-4447, through April 30. (Smith)    'JOSHUA SMITH: MAKE IT PLAIN' Smart yet homey, subversive yet beautiful, Mr. Smith's second solo show combines formerly busy canvases revised into busily bordered gray monochromes and a sea of bar stools arted-up with similarly nonchalant flair. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212)477-5006, through April 29. (Smith)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style. City Hall Park, (212)980-4575, through October. (Johnson)    Last Chance    NORMAN BLUHM A second-generation Abstract Expressionist who tended to dismiss the designation, Bluhm (1921-99) still held on to the sweeping ''gestural'' painting. He was a painter to reckon with: unfazed by styles or trends, he did it his way. James Graham, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212)535-5767, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)    SYDNEY BLUM, ''Undoing.'' File these elegant, ethereal wall pieces, made of tangles of thin wire variously colored, bent, crinkled and coiled, under the heading of art that looks easy but isn't. Kim Foster, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)229-0044, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    ERIC FISCHL Paintings based on his own photographs of hired models behaving like jaded sophisticates. They are suavely made with wide brushes in muted colors, but a frustrating vagueness limits the psychological intrigue. Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)752-2929, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE FITZWILLIAM MUSEUM, CAMBRIDGE' The Frick's third show devoted to small bronze sculptures continues to enhance the notion that mini-bronzes are as rewarding as large-scale sculpture. Though small, they have the charge of life-size works. 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700, closing on Sunday. (Glueck)    JOE FYFE, ''Paintings From Vietnam.'' Mr. Fyfe, an art critic and painter, made the almost purely abstract paintings in this small show in Vietnam last year. They are rough and reticent yet somehow delicately poetic, too. JG Contemporary, 505 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212)564-7662, closing tomorrow (Johnson).    ROBERT GOBER Mr. Gober turns the Matthew Marks space into a kind of church, with a suspended crucifix, inaccessible side chapels and intimations of a priest. Facsimiles of The New York Times add the Clinton years and 9/11 to his perennial themes of life and death, sin and redemption. It's iconography with an old-fashioned moral vehemence, combining the hermetic with the familiar in mind-twisting ways. 522 West 22nd Street, (212)243-0200, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    MARK HEYER Mr. Heyer's small, folksy narrative paintings of subjects like a tornado approaching a Midwestern farm look as if they were made by a simple-minded colleague of Edward Hopper and Charles Burchfield. That they are actually clever Postmodernist simulations does not prevent them from being nostalgically enchanting. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)675-2656, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    ELLSWORTH KELLY: 'SMALL PAINTINGS, 1955- 63,' A gem of an exhibition presents seven small paintings from a formative period in the career of one of our most celebrated abstractionists. Mr. Kelly's subtly witty, formally acute play with simple shapes, the picture plane and primary colors gives these works a punchy vitality. Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212)966-5154, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: DEAR PAINTER, PAINT FOR ME' After John Baldessari, but before Damien Hirst, Kippenberger hired a commercial artist to make photorealist paintings, which are personalized by their quirky compositions and his frequent presence. They have never been shown together in New York. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, (212)744-2313, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    'MODEL MODERNISMS' This smart show of wry and oblique takes on Modernism includes driftwood sculptures by Carol Bove and a haunting video by Florian Pumhosl whose climax is a close-up of a Cyclops quietly peeling an apple. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, SoHo, (212)226-3970, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CONTEMPORARY VOICES: WORKS FROM THE UBS ART COLLECTION' The most visionary museum of the 20th century inaugurates its temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep it from feeling corporate, monotonous and by the book. (See above.) Closing on Monday. (Smith)    GONZALO PUCH: 'INCIDENTES' Five metaphysical C-print photographs seem to comment ironically on science, art, their ambitions and intersections. The punchiest shows the artist on the floor, his mouth affixed to a tube. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)627-2410, closing tomorrow (Glueck).    HERVÉ DI ROSA: 'THE SOLO GROUP SHOW' A French Neo-Popster presents more than 500 small paintings and drawings in four clusters. The gleeful irreverence and love of absurdity holds it all together that wins you over. Haim Chanin, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (646)230-7200, closing tomorrow (Johnson).    ALEXANDER ROSS Mr. Ross's funny, weird, Pop-Surrealist paintings look like the work of a nerdy teenager steeped in science fiction and cannabis. Feature, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)675-7772, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    ZULMA STEELE AND ARTHUR WESLEY DOW There's a mismatch of talents here. In this show of their landscapes, she is far outclassed by him. Spanierman Gallery, 45 East 58th Street, (212)832-0208, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)    MAGNUS VON PLESSEN In his eagerness to suggest fluctuating moods and rapid shifting of perceptions, he puts down fugitive images done in by paint or the lack of it. Paint, or its strategic omission, the artist seems to say, trumps imagery. In more talented hands, this is often true, but not here. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-9300, closing tomorrow.

Broadway    + 'ALL SHOOK UP' Compared to its sickly cousin, ''Good Vibrations'' (that's the Beach Boys musical), this synthetic jukebox musical, inspired by the songs of Elvis Presley, looks like Jose Canseco at his steroid-plumped peak. But the relative slickness of ''All Shook Up,'' which features the appealing Cheyenne Jackson as an Elvis-like roustabout, only highlights the emptiness of this ''Mamma Mia!''-style story of a pleasure-challenged small town, directed by Christopher Ashley. In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $19.55 to $100.  BEN BRANTLEY    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are on a rampage in Daniel Sullivan's carnage-happy interpretation of Shakespeare's tragedy. Dripping blood and breathing smoke, these specters are chewing up everything in their path: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus. As the most important passenger on this fast, bumpy ride of a show, Mr. Washington does not embarrass himself. But despite several moving evocations of Brutus's ambivalence, he can't help getting lost amid the wandering, mismatched crowd assembled here. The cast includes the classically polished Colm Feore as Cassius (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51.25 to $101.25.  BRANTLEY    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $90.25.  BRANTLEY    +'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' Memory, which is notorious for playing tricks on people, pulls off some doozies in this narcoticized production of Tennessee Williams's classic drama. Staged by David Leveaux, this revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea through which people swim slowly and blindly. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange, who brings a sleepy, neurotic sensuality to the role of the vital and domineering Amanda Wingfield, and Christian Slater, who is a red-hot firebrand as her poetical son, Tom (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25.  BRANTLEY    +'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason and ''Spamalot'' make an odd Broadway pair facing off across 44th Street, but reactions to the two shows are remarkably similar: lots of laughter, much of it indiscriminate. Mr. Mason's new show is being promoted as a feast of exclusively new material, and this is not false advertising. But it's Mr. Mason's style and not his subject matter that signifies. Mr. Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $81. 25.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people (including the cast) that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience among school-age children and grown-ups in touch with the nerdy, nose-thumbing 12-year-olds within. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a cast that includes Tim Curry, David Hyde Pierce, Hank Azaria and the toothsome scenery chewer Sara Ramirez (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25.  BRANTLEY    +'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' In Robert Harling's freeze-dried comedy, people speak in the kinds of sentences that wind up embroidered on decorative pillows: ''There is no such thing as natural beauty,'' or, ''I'd rather have 30 minutes of wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special.'' Cute and sassy or sweet and soggy, the dialogue sometimes achieves the distinction of being all these things. But despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television (including Christine Ebersole, Delta Burke and Marsha Mason), sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46.75 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    'CALIGULA.' Playing the famously vainglorious Roman ruler Caligula reinvented as a postmodern actor-cum-director, gasbag moralist and irreverent critic of biographies about himself, Andre De Shields is phenomenal. This particularly gifted and disciplined actor blasts Alfred Preisser and Randy Weiner's play onto an electrified plane where histrionic egomania and sweaty petulance seem like the only ways to fill a stage. A Classical Theater of Harlem production directed by Mr. Preisser, this Caligula is an original work, not an adaptation of Camus, and like the company's 2003 hit production of Genet's ''Blacks,'' the show makes resonant use of a generalized, shabby circus setting and interactions with the audience that deliberately risk offense. Consistency of ideas isn't the show's strength, but the diminutive Mr. De Shields makes it all worthwhile, towering over the 13 other actors with his outsized energy and charisma (1:25). Classical Theater of Harlem at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, between 141st and 142nd Streets, (212)868-4444. Tickets: $25.  JONATHAN KALB    'DECO DIVA' Kara Wilson makes her entrance in an emerald green evening dress. She is the Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka, living in Paris in 1939. In the course of the play, Ms. Wilson paints a copy of Lempicka's ''Beautiful Rafaela,'' which feels like a parlor trick but adds needed texture to this stylish but lightweight work. After her daughter was born, Lempicka took up painting, in the new Art Deco style, finding both career satisfaction and financial success. Ms. Wilson, who is likably insouciant as Lempicka, occasionally breaks into song. The show ends with a little Kurt Weill, which seems appropriate (1:05) 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8:30 p.m.; Sundays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 p.m. Tickets: $25.  ANITA GATES    +'THE FALSE SERVANT' Decked out in a smart black tailcoat and shiny leather boots, her hair styled in a sleek blond cap, Martha Plimpton cuts a debonair figure in the Classic Stage Company's revival of this unusually chilly Marivaux comedy. Ms. Plimpton's dashing performance imbues the proceedings with a bright, puckish spirit, but Mr. Kulick's efficient but mechanical staging emphasizes the nip that never leaves the air. Its stark simplicity underscores the sensation that we might almost be watching a Shakespeare comedy unfolding in a cold-storage warehouse (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; this Sunday and May 1 at 3 p.m. Tickets: 45 to $50.  ISHERWOOD    ++'GOING TO ST. IVES' Questions of life and death are probed and settled over pots of tea in Lee Blessing's thoughtful, tidy two-hander. May N'Kame (L. Scott Caldwell), the mother of a bloodthirsty African dictator, and Dr. Cora Gage (Vivienne Benesch), a respected British eye surgeon, are brought together by circumstance: May's eyesight is failing. Their relationship will have fateful consequences for both. Mr. Blessing has a handy knack for domesticating seemingly unruly subject matter: the violent legacy of colonialism, the responsibility of Western governments to confront the carnage in Africa, the moral argument for sacrificing one life to save many. But if the play's structural and thematic niceties are intellectually pleasing, they also imbue it with a hollow, manufactured quality that fine performances cannot entirely disguise (2:00). Primary Stages, 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    +'BONNIE PARKER' In the middle of her deadly one-woman show, Dixie Lee Sedgwick suddenly does a cartwheel. And at one point she inexplicably gets down on the floor and poses like the young woman in Andrew Wyeth's ''Christina's World.'' There is probably a lot of rich material in the psyche of Parker, who made her name as the bank-robbing partner of Clyde Barrow in Depression-era America and died with him at 23), but Ms. Sedgwick gives her audience only a one-dimensional character, a young Texas woman who is bored before she meets Barrow and dissatisfied afterward, and the exposition is consistently awkward, This is not to say that Ms. Sedgwick does not have ability or promise, only that this is an immature work (2:00). John Houseman Studio Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, (212)868-4444. Mondays, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.95.  GATES    'THIS IS HOW IT GOES' Ben Stiller, famous in movies as an everyklutz, is the ideal guide for escorting audiences through the slippery maze of Neil LaBute's extended ploy of a play, directed by George C. Wolfe. In this story of an interracial romantic triangle, Mr. Stiller gives an artfully layered, deceptive performance that leaves you thinking it's a pity he had to portray a moral construct instead of a character. The same might be said of Jeffrey Wright as his surly rival. Fortunately, the wonderful Amanda Peet, exuding an aura of fractured confidence, is allowed to exist outside of the confining dimensions of a sermon (1:30). Public Theater/Anspacher Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    'WHAT OF THE NIGHT' A solo show starring Jane Alexander as Djuna Barnes, the literary adventurer best known for her spooky modernist novel ''Nightwood,'' this theatrical curio combines some of the standard facets of dead-celebrity stage plays with the more rarefied and often inscrutable behaviors endemic in the world of performance art. Conceived by Ms. Alexander, choreographer and director Birgitta Trommler and Noreen Tomassi, it provides a sense of Barnes' strange, hallucinatory prose, but remains a confusing amalgam of biography and literary homage: a morass of cranky chitchat, pointless stage business and arcane oration (1:15). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    Off Off Broadway    'THE AUDIENCE' This new musical turns the footlights on Rows A through E at a fictional Broadway production. Conceived and directed by Jack Cummings III, the show has been assembled from contributions by a few dozen writers, composers and lyricists. Whiplash-inducing fluctuations in quality and style are not a problem, however: while there are moments both sentimental and funny here, most of the contributors seem to have obeyed an official mandate to stick strictly to stereotype (1:40). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $19.  ISHERWOOD    'FINNEGANS WAKE' The idea of basing a musical on James Joyce's epic and near-impenetrable feast of language, ''Finnegans Wake,'' sounds perilously close to material for a skit on ''Saturday Night Live.'' But to the credit of Barbara Vann, who adapted the piece for the stage, her Medicine Show Theater Ensemble presents pure Joyce. If some of the tedium of the original comes through, so does the music of its language; and if the performance is uneven, it offers moments of beauty and insight, as when all the characters come under a veil that suddenly recasts itself as the sheet of Finnegan's bed as he, dreaming through an epic that seeks to explore human consciousness at night, begins to wake up (2:30). The Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212) 868-4444. Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sunday nights at 7. Tickets: $15.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'PLAY IN A PUB' It can be thrilling when one performance in an earthbound double bill about love and desire abruptly takes off, pulling the enterprise into the realm of feeling and belief. As a wry young Frenchwoman who chooses an ex-G.I. as her first lover, Kelli Holsopple persuades you that you are not in a restaurant bar in the East Village watching Romulus Linney's one-act play ''Can Can,'' but in France, with her. The evening opens with ''A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot,'' a revealing burlesque by Tennessee Williams about two lonely women of a certain age and their hunger for at least an encounter with the opposite sex, if not happiness. Phoenix Theater Ensemble's ''Play in a Pub'' runs through April 28 at the Bacchus Room, Bona Fides Restaurant, 60 Second Avenue, at Third Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. Sunday at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $15 plus one drink minimum.  ANDREA STEVENS    Last Chance    +* 'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. The well-oiled, highly polished 10-actor ensemble is led by James Naughton and Richard Thomas. You're likely to find yourself echoing the sentiments of a government functionary caught up in the surge of tension and relief in a closely fought voting session. ''Never mind football!'' he exclaims. ''Try parliamentary democracy!'' (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    +'HIDING BEHIND COMETS' The dynamics of the guy-walks-into-a-bar play are tricky. Inject a set of twins into the mix, as Brian Dykstra does in his play, and you've pretty much doomed the venture. The twins here are a male-female pair, 20-somethings named Troy (Robert Mollohan) and Honey (Moira MacDonald). They mind their father's dingy bar. The stranger who intrudes is Cole (Dan Moran), an elliptical older fellow with a temper. After much verbal sparring, and a lot of sex talk that isn't very sexy, the point emerges: Cole was supposedly at Jonestown during the mass suicide there in 1978, and he has dropped by the bar to force Honey and Troy to rethink their parentage. Mr. Dykstra's script sounds as if it's banking on the shock value of Jonestown, hoping that the audience, like the idiot twins on the stage, will not have heard of it. Way too early for that (1:45). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 3. Tickets: $35; $40 for Fridays and Saturday evenings. Closes April 17.  NEIL GENZLINGER    'RADIUM' Alex S. DeFazio's unfocused drama operates on the ''now that I have your attention ...'' principle. The first scene is of two naked men simulating anal sex. One is the play's would-be hero, Alexis (as in Alex S., one presumes). The other, J., is the play's most interesting creation, a devastatingly good-looking guy whose favorite game is picking up men and then refusing to satisfy them sexually. ''I've never been rejected, not as I am,'' he says. Unfortunately, ''Radium'' isn't about J. The play does have an inventive Pinteresque structure, but basically Mr. DeFazio has written two acts of college-boy poetry about being gay, looking for emotional connections and feeling uncomfortable about it all (1:40). The Jewel Box Theater, at the 42nd Street Workshop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $25, $15 for 65+ and students.  GATES    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BEAUTY SHOP' Directed by Billie Woodruff. Starring Queen Latifah, Alicia Silverstone, Kevin Bacon and Djimon Hounsou (PG-13, 105 minutes). Less a sequel than an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff, this loose and genial comedy moves the ''Barbershop'' franchise to Atlanta, and gives the ladies a turn at the warm, salty banter that made the first two installments so popular. Queen Latifa plays Gina, who quits her job at an upscale salon (run by Mr. Bacon's character) and opens her own establishment. Staffed by a group of boisterous women, along with a token male, the place soon becomes a neighborhood institution. Various subplots pop up now and then, but like its predecessors, this movie runs less on story than on the relaxed, playful humor that accompanies serious hair care.  A.O. SCOTT    'THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE' Written and directed by Rebecca Miller. Starring Daniel Day-Lewis (R, 112 minutes). The Jack of all trades in this new film, played by the brilliant actor Daniel Day-Lewis, is no ordinary man. A proud survivor of the 1960's and its utopian promise, Jack lives alone on an island with his only daughter, Rose (Camilla Belle). Shrunk to near-skeletal size, his bones poking right angles through his clothes, Jack suffers from two heart conditions. One will soon put him six feet under. But before that, the other may send the terminal outsider and his daughter down the path of disaster, though one shaped more by the tao of Oprah and Dr. Phil than the tragedy of Lear and Cordelia. A story about the limits of love, ''The Ballad of Jack and Rose'' is also about the limits of idealism as well as, rather unfortunately, those of its restlessly ambitious writer and director.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'GUESS WHO' Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan. Starring Bernie Mac, Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldaña (PG-13, 103 minutes). This loose, pointless remake of ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' at least suggests that American racial attitudes have relaxed since 1967, when Spencer Tracy worried about Sidney Poitier marrying his daughter. This time, the worried father is played by Mr. Mac, and the suitor by Mr. Kutcher. Mr. Mac plays Percy Jones, a truculent suburban patriarch deeply suspicious of Simon Green, the amiable, spazzy stockbroker played by Mr. Kutcher. He and Ms. Saldaña, who plays Percy's older daughter and Simon's fiancée, is charming and attractive, but her role is quite secondary to what is at bottom an interracial buddy comedy. Or would be, if the squad of screenwriters had bothered to write any funny jokes.  SCOTT    * 'FEVER PITCH' Directed by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly. Starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch ''Fever Pitch,'' the new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. That is, of course, not big news. If Hollywood has taught us anything over the last century it is that every so often a seemingly ordinary commercial enterprise can afford us fleeting access to the sublime. And for my money, there are few movie moments right now more sublime than the image of Drew Barrymore running across a major league baseball field and, with that famous jaw jutting into the wind, dodging ballplayers and storybook clichés to save the windup of this imperfectly true romance. Based on the memoir by Nick Hornby, the film doesn't fully work, but I ended up rooting for it anyway, partly because Ms. Barrymore and her costar Jimmy Fallon make a nice fit, partly because the Farrellys bring so much heart to their movie.  DARGIS    'HOSTAGE' Directed by Florent Siri. Starring Bruce Willis and Kevin Pollak (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Mr. Willis's fading career as an action hero. The star plays a former hostage negotiator who has exiled himself to a quiet southern California town after a botched standoff. He springs back into action when the cliff-hugging mansion of a crooked book-cooking corporate accountant (Mr. Pollak) is simultaneously invaded by a posse of teenage punks and by a S.W.A.T. team of high-tech gangsters. The fiery demolition of this architectural monstrosity in which the accountant lives with his two children is the only thing worth applauding in this mess of film.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' Directed by Stephen Chow. Starring Mr. Chow (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese, with English subtitles). Recent Chinese-language action epics like ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' ane ''Hero'' have been somber, almost operatic, so it is nice that the prolific Mr. Chow has supplied the latest reminder that the martial arts tradition has plenty of room for clowning. This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender -- western, Looney Tunes, and several generations of Hong Kong chopsockery. Some old stars have been coaxed out of retirment, most notably Yuan Qiu, who plays a chain-smoking, leather-lunged Landlady -- imagine a combination of Lucille Ball, Thelma Ritter and the Tasmanian Devil -- and who upstages even the most extravagant computer-generated special effects. There is sure to be a sequel, but it's hardly necessary, since the concussive action sequences induce a kind of amnesia. You could watch this movie again and again, which is another way of saying that, in the end, it isn't very memorable.  SCOTT    * 'LOOK AT ME' Directed by Agnès Jaoui. Starring Marilou Berry, Ms. Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). Ms. Jaoui follows her marvelous first feature, ''The Taste of Others,'' with an equally delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers (some of whom also have beautiful houses in the country), the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. Mr. Bacri plays a famous novelist whose cavalier neglect of his slightly overweight daughter (Ms. Berry) is the moral pivot on which the complex plot turns. Ms. Jaoui plays the young woman's voice teacher, who husband is an up-and-coming novelist and who is either the film's most honest character or its most thorough-going hypocrite.  SCOTT    'MELINDA AND MELINDA' Directed by Woody Allen. Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Will Ferrell, Radha Mitchell and Chloe Sevigny (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though the drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, Mr. Allen interweaves them deftly enough and provides some of the members of his large cast with opportunities to do some crisp, old-fashioned stage-style acting. The link between the two tales in Ms. Mitchell, who plays Melinda in both -- an unhappy woman who throws the romantic, professional and social lives of a group of articulate Manhattanites into mild turmoil. In the tragedy, she chain-smokes and fidgets, while in the comedy she has an ingénue's golden glow. Some of the actors fare better than others -- Ms. Sevigny and Mr. Ejiofor seem best suited for Mr. Allen's anti-naturalistic approach to acting, while Mr. Ferrell's shambling geniality make him a poor choice for the inevitable role of Woody Allen surrogate. In any case, the movie is most powerful as an extended piece of real estate pornography, depicting a seductive fantasy New York (though filmed in the real one) where struggling filmmakers and out-of-work actors live in fabulous lofts and labyrinthine prewar apartments.  SCOTT    * 'MILLIONS' Directed by Danny Boyle. Starring Alex Etel (PG, 97 minutes). When it comes to making movies, Mr. Boyle is usually up to no good, which is something this visual stylist does with great ostentatious flair. Best known for ''Trainspotting,'' a grungy entertainment about the gleefully down and out, and for the shiver-filled zombie flick ''28 Days Later,'' Mr. Boyle is the sort of creative type in whom the milk of human kindness often seems to curdle rather than flow. Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves his stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. Pegged to a motherless child named Damian (Alex Etel, making a sensational debut), ''Millions'' is about the secret world of children, in particular that miraculous, tragically brief interlude when the young imagination -- not yet captive to crippling adult conventions like time, space and rational thought -- takes boundless flight.  DARGIS    'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' Directed by John Pasquin. Starring Sandra Bullock (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Ms. Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. Set a mere three weeks after the first film, which was released in 2000, this sequel finds Ms. Bullock as the charmingly clumsy F.B.I. agent Gracie Hart, vainly fending off unwanted celebrity. On her last assignment, Gracie infiltrated a beauty pageant by metamorphosing from duckling to swan, a mission that earned her legions of fans across the country. After her cover is blown during a bank heist, endangering her and the other agents on her team, the powers that be decide that she should become ''the face of the F.B.I.,'' the idea being that flouncing about in designer threads will be better for Gracie's soul and career and, by extension, this movie than pushing pencils. It isn't.  DARGIS    'THE PACIFIER' Directed by Adam Shankman. Starring Vin Diesel (PG, 97 minutes). In the primary visual gag of ''The Pacifier,'' a Navy Seal, on a top-secret babysitting mission, retrofits his gun and grenade holders to keep baby formula and diapers at the ready. Despite the specter of boogeymen, Disney's new family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. As a special-ops warrior with a heart-thawing assignment, Mr. Diesel succeeds as a genre-switcher through the help of an able ensemble. The mayhem should delight kids, just as the imposed order will please parents. Anyone else, however, might feel as though they are, in Mr. Diesel's words, merely ''burning daylight.''  NED MARTEL    'THE RING TWO' Directed by Hideo Nakata. Starring Naomi Watts (PG-13, 111 minutes). It was only a matter of time before the Japanese horror auteur Hideo Nakata went Hollywood and so he has at last as the director of, yes, ''The Ring Two,'' the inevitable sequel to the American remake of his original hit. (Got that?) Once again, Ms. Watts plays Rachel Keller, a journalist and a single mom to a young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), recently relocated from Seattle to a small coastal town in Oregon. In ''The Ring,'' Rachel escaped the marauding ghost in the machine and now thinks she has entered a new chapter. No such luck; she is actually mucking about on a slag heap of recycled scares, dumb lines and predictable entanglements, including some static with a potential boyfriend replacement (Simon Baker) and some weirdness with an asylum inmate (Sissy Spacek in a fright wig). Once again, blood pools, water flows and the ghost comes calling through the magic of video, scaring to death anyone foolish enough not to have made the move to DVD.  DARGIS    'ROBOTS' Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha. With the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and Robin Williams (PG, 89 minutes). Like so many other non-Pixar computer-animated family movies, this one, from Fox's Blue Sky Studios, runs on visual novelty and narrative familiarity. The setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination, as are the characters, an assortment of dented heroes and sleek, silvery villains. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions, cool soundtrack music and heartwarming lessons about being yourself and following your dreams. There is, it must be said, a certain honesty to the story, which suggests that recycled, second-hand junk is superior to the latest high-tech upgrades, a moral the movie at once upholds and refutes.  SCOTT    'SAHARA' Directed by Breck Eisner. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, Lambert Wilson, Glynn Turman, Delroy Lindo, William H. Macy and Rainn Wilson. (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but ''Sahara,'' the screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn, is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. A fusion of old and new, it both is and isn't a delirious escape into adventure-serial heaven. Amid its madcap derring-do, the movie inserts clear, simple alarms about environmental protection, African despotism, global interdependence, and bureaucratic cowardice. Its dressing up of an old-fashioned adventure fantasy in contemporary threads is an experiment in juxtaposition that gains in assurance as the film bounds along. As the swashbuckling comic hero Dirk Pitt, Mr. McConaughey at last gets a clear shot at stepping into Harrison Ford's $20 million trekking shoes, but those shoes may not fit.  HOLDEN    * 'SCHIZO' Directed by Guka Omarova. Starring Olzhas Nusuppaev. (not rated, 86 minutes, in Russian, with English subtitles). This modest neo-realist film from Kazhakstan is both tough and tender, and it illuminates the lives of its characters with bracing clarity and understated empathy. Schizo is a teen-aged boy living with his mother and her boyfriend in a desolate area of vast fields and ababandoned industry. After helping his would-be stepfather recruit fighters for illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches, Schizo gets involved with Zinka, a local woman whose husband has died in the ring after a brutal bout. Their friendship is sweet and a little improbable, but as the movie follows the conventions of a crime-tinged coming-of-age story it achieves a rough, convincing poetry made of the hard circumstances of real life.  SCOTT    'SIN CITY' Directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. Starring Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis (R, 126 minutes). There are eight million stories in the naked city and almost as many crammed into ''Sin City.'' Based on the comic book series of the same name by Mr. Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls recycled from the lower depths and bottom shelves of pulp fiction. Instead of Raymond Chandler, though, these hard-boiled tales owe a debt to the American primitivism of Mickey Spillane and comic book legends like William Gaines. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. In recent years, Mr. Rodriguez has been a careless craftsman, but he went to great lengths to honor Mr. Miller's vision. Alas, in an effort to make a faithful adaptation, Mr. Rodriguez put his own movie sense on hold, not even bothering with a real script.  DARGIS    'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' Directed by Mike Binder. Starring Joan Allen, Kevin Costner, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Mr. Costner and Ms. Allen to do some marvelous work. Both performances are somewhat familiar: Mr. Costner, once again, is an athlete past his prime, and Ms. Allen is a brittle, unhappy suburban housewife, but the actors slip into their characters with ease and wit, and complement each other beautifully as they explore a haphazard friendship that turns into a love affair. The downside is that Mr. Binder does not give them enough of a dramatic context to work in, and undermines their efforts with a surprise ending that very nearly destroys the whole movie. Ms. Witt, Ms. Christensen, Ms. Wood and Ms. Russell play Ms. Allen's daughters, but their characters are as thinly conceived as figures in a television pilot, and it is hard to believe that the four of them and Ms. Allen add up to a family.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    THE BRAVERY, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. This cheerfully ridiculous neo-wave band comes armed with plenty of pseudo-disco basslines and gobs of eye makeup. This combination has earned the band a bunch of fans and perhaps an even bigger (or, at any rate, more vocal) bunch of detractors, including the lead singer of another neo-wave band, the Killers. For entertainment's sake, here's hoping some detractors sneak in among the fans during this concert -- rock bands don't get booed often enough. Sunday night at 8, with Ash and alaska!; tickets -- $16 in advance, $18 at the door -- are sold out, but returns may be available.  KELEFA SANNEH    T BROUSSARD AND THE ZYDECO STEPPERS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. Bryant (T) Broussard has Lousiana musicians on both sides of his family. He's the accordionist and singer of a hard-working zydeco band. This show on Sunday, presented by Let's Zydeco, starts with dance lessons at 1:30 followed by the band from 2:30 to 6; admission is $18.  JON PARELES    CHOCOLATE GENIUS, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Marc Anthony Thompson, aka Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs full of goodbyes, ambling amid rock and rhythm-and-blues. His husky voice brings long-suffering passion to his twilit ballads. But between songs, he lets loose a sly and uninhibited sense of humor. Tomorrow night at 9:30, with Alice Smith opening; tickets are $15.  PARELES    DAMON AND NAOMI, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. Damon and Naomi used to be in Galaxie 500, and on their own they have held onto the old group's hushed tone and searching simplicity; their group includes Kurihara from the Japanese band Ghost. Sunday night at 7, with Adrian Crowley and the writer Rick Moody, doing a reading, opening. Admission is $12.  PARELES    DJ LE SPAM AND THE SPAM ALLSTARS, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940. This party imported from Miami puts a disc jockey together with live musicians, mixing Latin rhythms with electronic beats. Tomorrow night, midnight to dawn; admission is $10.  PARELES    OSCAR D'LEON, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street (212) 239-2672. Oscar D'Leon, a suavely forceful singer and a bass-twirling bandleader from Venezuela, leads a high-powered dance band that holds on to the best aspects of 1970's and 1980's salsa. Tomorrow night at 10 p.m., trading sets with Raffy Matias; admission is $25. PARELES C. GIBBS, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212)683-6500. Christian Gibbs, who played lead guitar for Modern English and Foetus before starting his own bands, never settles down. As his lyrics detail surreal and troubled visions, with titles like ''Oversized Pin Cushion'' and ''Superficial Flesh Wound,'' the music wanders amid countryish rock, cracked cabaret oom-pah and elaborate, Beatles-flavored ballads. Tonight's first set starts at 10; free.  PARELES    CHARLIE GRACIE, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212)683-6500. In 1957, Charlie Gracie was a rockabilly singer from Philadelphia whose hit, ''Butterfly,'' topped Elvis Presley on the charts. Years later, he still works his guitar hard. Tomorrow night's first set is at 10; free.  PARELES    THE KLEZMATICS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. The Klezmatics love the laughing, moaning melodies of traditional klezmer music. They also love jazz, rock and downtown improvisation, and they bring all of them to bear on their music, which can be raucous, hypnotic, reverent and dizzying, sometimes all in one quick-changing piece. They carry klezmer's itinerant, idea-gathering spirit all the way into present-day New York City. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 at the door.  PARELES    MEGACONCIERTO 2005, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741. Watch Latin pop change generations and demographics, as the Puerto Rican salsa and pop singer Victor Manuelle shares a bill with the reggaeton rapper Don Omar; the Dominican merengue singer Toño Rosario; the Dominican bachata singer Frankie Reyes and the vocal group Aventura, which adds socially aware lyrics and touches of rhythm-and-blues to bachata; and Jorge Celedon, who sings accordion-driven Colombian vallenatos. Tonight at 8; tickets are $59.50 to $99.50.  PARELES    MOFRO/CYRO BAPTISTA AND BEAT THE DONKEY, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. Mofro, a pair of guitarists from Florida, play bluesy songs that revel in swampy roots. Cyro Baptista, a Brazilian percussionist who's fond of melody and humor as well as rhythm, leads a troupe of percussionists and dancers in Beat the Donkey, his 10-member mini-carnival, playing instruments and rhythms that are both traditional and newly concocted. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $15 in advance, $18 at the door.  PARELES    * NELLY , the Theater at Madison Square Garden, 7th Avenue at 32nd Street, (212)465-6741. Still counting the money from his ambitious and charming recent pair of albums, ''Sweat'' and ''Suit'' (Universal), Nelly comes to town to celebrate his continuing success -- and, perhaps, his neat feat of making a video (''Over and Over,'' with the country star Tim McGraw) that plays on both BET and CMT. He is to be joined by a strong line-up of rappers: the energetic heavyweight Fat Joe and, best of all, the slick but ferocious Atlanta kingpin T.I. Tonight at 8, tickets are $45.50 to $75.50.  SANNEH    NINA NASTASIA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. In her clear voice, Nina Nastasia sings visions of desolation and unflinching love -- ''dirty hands and dirty feet and all'' -- with melodies that can hint at the symmetries of Appalachian music and a homespun backup from instruments like accordion and banjo. Tomorrow night at 8, with Richard Milner opening; tickets are $12.  PARELES    OF MONTREAL, Northsix, 66 North 6th Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. Of Montreal, which emerged with the Elephant Six collective of neo-psychedelic bands in Athens, Ga., plays giddy, optimistic, harmonically rambling songs by Kevin Barnes, who's clearly a Beach Boys and Beatles fan. Tomorrow night at 9 with St. Thomas and the Bluffs opening; admission is $10.  PARELES    * ONEIDA, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. Oneida, a New York band, leans hard on the keyboard-driven minimal rock of the early 1980's for songs that are joyfully relentless. It revs up frantic, obsessive patterns to carry thoughts about history, sex, drugs, rock and roll and a dystopian future, with a drive that's both obsessive and ecstatic. Tomorrow night at 11:30, with Magnolia Electric Co. and Oakley Hall opening; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow.  PARELES    * THE SCUMFROG, the Sullivan Room, 218 Sullivan Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)252-2151. This party celebrates the three year anniversary of this cozy dance club. The headliner is the Scumfrog, a house producer and D.J. who pays tribute to disco in his own weird way, emphasizing dirty synthesizer lines and tinny vocals; the result is an appealing, free-floating sleaziness. Tonight at 10, with Alex Pearce, Kind Nick and 3 Speaker High; admission is $15.  SANNEH    SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536. Anyone who's heard a salsa band in New York City has probably seen some of the members of the Spanish Harlem Orchestra: They're the virtuosic journeymen who are one of New York City's great musical resources. As the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, they reclaim salsa classics under the direction of the keyboardist Oscar Hernandez, who has worked with Ruben Blades and Paul Simon. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 and $35.  PARELES    ROD STEWART, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900. The soulful scratch in Rod Stewart's voice has carried him through boozy rock, rootsy coming-of-age tales, nostalgic rock and, lately, standards. He's unafraid to be a self-parody as long as it pleases the crowds. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37.50 to $95.  PARELES    * JESSE SYKES AND THE SWEET HEREAFTER, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. A cold wind seems to blow through Jesse Sykes' voice as her songs face desolation and mortality, while her band, the Sweet Hereafter, plays in poised slow motion. There's country in the music, with brushes on the drums and pedal-steel guitar wafting in from above; there's also a sighing viola and a touch of surf-guitar reverb. It's spellbound music, rapt in fatalism and sorrow. Tomorrow night at 11, with Great Lake Swimmers at 10, the M's at 9 and Jennifer O'Connor at 8; admission is $12.  PARELES    * DANNY TENAGLIA, Spirit, 530 W. 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. Mr. Tenaglia is one of the city's greatest and most reliable -- and most relentless -- dance music D.J.'s. At this party celebrating, um, a party he threw a year ago, expect a long, delirious night: Mr. Tenaglia is beloved not only for his catholic approach to house music (from clattering rhythm-only tracks to sleek electronic confections), but for his extraordinary stamina, too. Tonight at 11; tickets are $30 in advance, $40 at the door.  SANNEH    PAUL VAN DYK, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. When this wildly popular German progressive-house producer and D.J. comes to town, you can expect a precise set full of the usual dancefloor-pleasing devices: heroic synthesizer lines, sudden (or gradual) volume changes and lots of wooshing sounds. Tonight after 10; tickets are $40 in advance, $50 at the door.  SANNEH    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed musician and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, with a $15 minimum. (An $80 dinner-and-show package is available.)  STEPHEN HOLDEN    * BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    * DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This singer's brilliant but exhausting two-hour show, ''J'ai Deux Amours,'' makes a compelling case that every American performer would profit by taking an extended sabbatical in Paris. That's where Ms. Bridgewater has lived for the last two decades. Her expatriate perspective encouraged the one-time rhythm-and-blues singer from Flint, Mich., to refine the far-flung musical vocabulary that infuses this bilingual program of mostly familiar, mostly French-originated pop songs. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30 (tickets: $65), and Sunday at 7:30 (tickets: $50); all shows have a two-drink minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    KENNY BARRON SEXTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595; www.jalc.org. Mr. Barron, the pianist who has been a widespread presence in jazz over the last three decades, seeks out collaborators of various generations and styles and works energetically on the bandstand. This band includes Vincent Herring, Dayna Stephens, Eddie Henderson, Kiyoshi Kitigawa, and Victor Lewis. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, plus a $5 minimum at the bar, $10 at the tables.  BEN RATLIFF    * GEORGE CABLES PROJECT, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. With quiet intensity, Mr. Cables solidified his reputation as one of the best mainstream-jazz pianists during the 1970s; he doesn't lead bands in New York that often, so this is a chance to see him with a particularly good one, including the saxophonist Gary Bartz, bassist Eric Revis and drummer Jeff Watts. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $25.  RATLIFF    EDMAR CASTANEDA SEXTET, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626. A young Colombian musician, Mr. Castaneda plays the harp, which has, obviously, rarely been used in jazz; but once you see his percussive technique you might wonder why this is so. Sets are Sunday at 8 and 10; cover charge is $15, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    BILL CHARLAP TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. For about eight years, the pianist Mr. Charlap has had a steady trio with the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Kenny Washington; his performances have become extraordinary displays of discipline and improvisation in the language of mainstream jazz -- the wonders of an organized, creative mind. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    CARLA COOK, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626. A soulful singer who reaches outside jazz into pop and gospel to get what she needs; usually she has an excellent jazz group backing her up. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    ELI DEGIBRI QUARTET, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212)929-7565. A young tenor saxophonist from Israel, Mr. Degibri is starting to be known in New York; he commanded some attention when he toured with Herbie Hancock several years ago. Don't miss him. He is a very modern improviser, super-artful; his creations are spiky and fractured, but immaculately sculptured. With Ben Monder on guitar, Ben Street on bass, and Bill Stewart (today) or Adam Cruz (tomorrow) on drums. Shows begin at 10 p.m. Cover, $10 and there is a two-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    MARK FELDMAN-SYLVIE COURVOISIER/IKUE MORI, The Stone, Avenue C and 2nd Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com. Tonight at 8, the violinist Mr. Feldman and pianist Ms. Courvoisier play the music of John Zorn; at 10, Ikue Mori plays a solo show involving laptop computers and percussive electronics. Admission is $10.  RATLIFF    SHELLEY HIRSCH-ANTHONY COLEMAN/ELLIOTT SHARP ORCHESTRA CARBON CONDUCTED BY BUTCH MORRIS, The Stone, Avenue C and 2nd Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com. Tomorrow at 8, the vocalist Ms. Hirsch and the pianist Anthony Coleman play a program called ''In and Around Kurt Weill''; at 10, Mr. Sharp's 13-piece band, as well as the conductor Butch Morris, crams into the new club's little stage area to perform a piece called ''Quarks Swim Free.'' Admission is $10 per set.  RATLIFF    * DAVE HOLLAND BIG BAND, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212) 581-3080. This big band is a relatively new 12-piece outgrowth of the bassist Mr. Holland's more widely known quintet. With the frighteningly well calibrated quintet, you know what you're going to get: careful compositions based on ostinatos, odd metered funk and counterpoint. The big band does more. Loud and fairly traditional, its arrangements for booming horn sections mix influences from postwar Count Basie and Duke Ellington, as well as Thad Jones; it's also music of a different temperature and mood, accommodating more slow tempos, along with some old-fashioned, take-your-time, knock-it-out-of-the-park solos. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40, minimum, $10 .  RATLIFF    * JAZZ COMPOSERS COLLECTIVE FESTIVAL, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. A worthy cooperative organization that has produced many concerts and brought forth a lot of good jazz records, the collective deserves your attention because of its tacit insistence on merging different approaches to playing and thinking about jazz -- as well as resurrecting old figures like Herbie Nichols and Lucky Thompson. Tonight, the pianist Frank Kimbrough's Trio, and the Herbie Nichols Project; tomorrow, Ben Allison's New Quartet, and a new band, the Lucky Thompson Project; Sunday, saxophonist Michael Blake's quartet. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    * 'JAZZ CUBANO REUNION' Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. The two young Cuban musicians Yosvany Terry (saxophones) and Dafnis Prieto (drums) get together with a few other mid-90's arrivals to New York's new Latin music scene -- the pianist Luis Perdomo and the bassist Alex Hernandez. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    * KATE McGARRY QUINTET, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770. A lot of jazz singers are good at a few devices and punch them out song after song; Ms. McGarry, who is slowly becoming known around New York, has a deeper supply. You'll find shades of pop singers like Suzanne Vega and Rickie Lee Jones in her voice; you'll also find some of the highest refinements of great jazz singing. She has a breadth of material that runs from jazz standards to traditional Irish ballads to a version of the Kinks' ''(So) Tired of Waiting for You.'' Her new record is ''Mercy Street'' (Palmetto), and she'll be playing new material, with the pianist Fred Hersch as guest. Tonight at 7:30; cover charge is $15.  RATLIFF    * NEW ORLEANS JAZZ ORCHESTRA, DIRECTED BY IRVIN MAYFIELD, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)721-6500. A 17-piece band from New Orleans led by the young, dynamic trumpeter Irvin Mayfield, who spends part of the year playing party music of the New World with Los Hombres Calientes and part of the year composing his own music, including the Wynton Marsalis-influenced suite ''Strange Fruit,'' just released on Basin Street records. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; remaining tickets are $100.  RATLIFF    TRIBUTE TO FRANK SINATRA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. A jazz musicians' gathering to honor the Voice, with contributions from the incomparable pianist Hank Jones, as well as Jim DiJulio, Mark Taylor, Eddie Bert, and others. Sets through Sunday are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $30, minimum, $5.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'CARMEN' Straightforward and streamlined, nipped and tucked to bring it in at three hours, City Opera's production of Bizet's classic seems livelier than it last did. Katharine Goeldner is a fine singer, and if the production didn't help her get far past your standard-issue Gypsy mannerisms, that was fine too. John Bellemer, a good-looking tenor with a soft-grained voice that sometimes hardens under strain, is singing his first performances with the company as a callow Don José; also new is Malcolm MacKenzie, an appropriately burly Escamillo. Gary Thor Wedow conducts, adequately. Sunday afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Remaining tickets: $32 to $65.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'DON GIOVANNI' The Metropolitan Opera's successful revival of its year-old production of ''Don Giovanni'' is playing again tomorrow night. The company has assembled a gang of good Mozarteans though not always ones bearing big names. Gerald Finley and Tamar Iveri are very good as the Don and Donna Anna. Samuel Ramey takes the unaccustomed role of Leporello and does well with it. Michael Yeargan's sets are simple and to the point. Philippe Jordan is the bright young Swiss conductor. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.  BERNARD HOLLAND    'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' The essentials of Puccini's opera are well-served in Mark Lamos's spare, attractive production, in which a magnified and uncluttered version of a traditional Japanese house fills the stage. A new cast joins the production tomorrow. The cast includes Marc Heller as Pinkerton, Jee Hyun Lin as Butterfly, Michael Corvino as Sharpless and Kathryn Friest as Suzuki. Atsushi Yamada conducts. Tonight at 8, New York City Opera, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Tickets: $37 to $105.  ALLAN KOZINN    'LES PÊCHEURS DE PERLES' With Zandra Rhodes's vividly colored sets and faux-native costumes, New York City Opera's new production of Bizet's early, pretty and slightly sluggish opera set in ancient Sri Lanka evokes the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. Mary Dunleavy, the Leïla, has a lovely clear soprano; Yeghishe Manucharyan, as Nadir, a small, pushed, but reasonably fluid tenor; and Emmanuel Plasson captures the languorous sensuality of the lovely music. Still, it's an opera in which not much happens, but takes a long time to do it. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Sold out, but returns may be available.  MIDGETTE    TOSCA. The young Italian tenor Salvatore Licitra made a last-minute debut at the Metropolitan Opera in May of 2002, substituting for Luciano Pavarotti in Puccini's ''Tosca'' on what was assumed (incorrectly, it turned out) would be Mr. Pavarotti's farewell to the Met. On that night, Mr. Licitra, who was 33 at the time, seemed an immensely gifted tenor with an exciting but raw and unfinished voice. He is back at the Met for the first time since his dramatic debut, again as Cavaradossi in ''Tosca.'' Unfortunately, as an artist and singer he remains a work in progress. He still boasts a dusky-toned and powerful voice and sings with youthful energy and fervor. But he was vocally cautious on the first night of the Met's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's 1985 production and his phrasing was sometimes labored. His Tosca, the veteran soprano Maria Guleghina, as is her way, sacrifices beauty of sound and lyrical elegance for the sake of hard-edged power and dramatic intensity. The veteran baritone Frederick Burchinal takes over the role of Scarpia. James Conlon conducts. Tonight at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $200.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In addition to championing forgotten composers, Leon Botstein and his orchestra have often presented fascinating but neglected music by figures we know well. Such is the case for this season-concluding program devoted to Richard Strauss's choral music, little known by even ardent Strauss admirers. Mr. Botstein will lead the orchestra and the Concert Chorale of New York in, among other works, ''Wanderers Sturmlied,'' ''Die Tageszeiten,'' and the ''Olympische Hymne,'' which Strauss conducted at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Sunday at 3, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53.  JEREMY EICHLER    ARTEK This early music ensemble is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, but it has changed greatly since its early days as a forum for Baroque keyboard works. Now its focus is more general, with vocal music -- especially vocal music that lends itself to dramatic presentation -- as a particular specialty. Even so, for old time's sake, the program tomorrow evening includes concertos for two harpsichords by J.S. Bach and two of his sons, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, and Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach. Gwendolyn Toth and Dongsok Shin are the harpsichord soloists, and the accompanying period instrument ensemble is to be conducted by Robert Mealy. The program also includes selections from J.S. Bach's Cantata No. 51 and an arrangement of Boccherini's ''Fandango,'' complete with castanets. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., St. Michael's Church, Amsterdam Avenue at 99th Street, (212)967-9157. Tickets: $20.  KOZINN    BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC They're calling it ''Brooklyn's Ode to Joy:'' the ever-struggling, ever-scrappy Brooklyn Phil is offering Beethoven's Ninth along with a new work the orchestra has commissioned, Jennifer Higdon's ''Dooryard Bloom,'' based on poems by a Brooklyn boy, Walt Whitman. The soloist in this first-ever performance of Ms. Higdon's piece is Nmon Ford; Michael Christie will conduct. Tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $60.  MIDGETTE    SARA DAVIS BUECHNER Besides being a nimble and elegant pianist, Sara Davis Buechner has a wide-ranging interest in overlooked repertory. Her Koch International recording of piano works by the operetta composer Rudolf Friml was an unexpected pleasure of 2003. So it's no surprise that the recital program she will play at the Greenwich House Music School tonight is rich with intriguing and little-known fare. After beginning with Mozart's Fantasy and Sonata in C minor, she offers works by Elliot Weisgarber, Yukiko Nishimura and Joaquin Turina. On Sunday afternoon she presents a master class at the school, open to the public. Recital tonight at 8; master class Sunday at 3 p.m.; Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212)242-4770. Tickets: $15, $10 for students for the recital; $7 for the master class.  TOMMASINI    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER For its final program of the season, the Chamber Music Society offers the premiere of Lalo Schifrin's ''Letters From Argentina.'' The instrumentation (double bass and bandoneón joining a more typical chamber ensemble) and the composer's own description suggest an autobiographical work inspired by the aural memories of his Buenos Aires childhood, including tango and folk music. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48.  EICHLER    DAPONTE STRING QUARTET David Del Tredici has written operas and orchestral works and won a Pulitzer Prize, but until recently he had never written a string quartet. The impetus for changing that was the DaPonte Quartet, four Juilliard- and Peabody-trained players who went to Maine in the 1990's on a rural residency grant from Chamber Music America and ended up settling down there. ''Settling'' doesn't preclude ''concertizing,'' and the quartet, which has played around the country, is making its New York debut tonight with pieces by Schulhoff and Beethoven, as well as Mr. Del Tredici's Quartet No. 1 in its New York premiere. Tonight at 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $30.  MIDGETTE    ENSEMBLE WIEN-BERLIN Compared to all those quartets and piano trios, woodwind chamber music seldom gets much time in the spotlight, but at least for this weekend the Ensemble Wien-Berlin will redress the imbalance. Consisting mainly of principal wind players (current and former) from the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonics, the group offers a ''Czech Winds Weekend'' with works by Dvorak, Janacek, Martinu, Pavel Haas and others spread over two programs. Tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $35.  EICHLER    FESTIVAL OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION WINNERS Big competition victories no longer guarantee professional success or even much exposure. The Metropolitan Museum is therefore trying to reward selected winners by presenting them in recital, in several cases for the first time in this country. The five remaining programs in this series will take place throughout the weekend: Severin von Eckardstein plays tonight at 8; Boris Giltburg is tomorrow at 3 p.m.; Alexei Grynyuk plays tomorrow night at 8; Giuseppe Albanese is Sunday at 3 p.m.; and Antti Siirala closes the festival Sunday night at 8. Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $20 each, or $80 for all concerts.  EICHLER    FELICITY LOTT AND ANGELIKA KIRCHSCHLAGER Schumann's song cycle ''Frauenliebe und -leben,'' settings of poems by the German Romantic poet Adelbert von Chamisso that deal with the lives and loves of women, is a landmark of the song repertory that is probably performed too often for its own good. But the soprano Felicity Lott and the mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager have found what looks to be a fresh way to present that work in context with other songs dealing with themes of a woman's life from girlhood to old age. The less familiar setting of the Chamisso poems by Karl Loewe will also be performed, along with songs by Brahms and Mendelssohn, all dealing with themes of women. Graham Johnson is the pianist. Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $48.  TOMMASINI    VIKTORIA MULLOVA This Russian violinist won the Tchaikovsky Competition in 1982, but earned bigger headlines when she defected to the West not long afterward. She is an energetic, focused player who some listeners find chilly and others virtuosic and precise. But her partner in this recital is the French pianist Katia Labèque, a firebrand (and sometime jazz pianist), and it's hard to imagine Ms. Labèque signing on for a performance that threatens to be icy. The repertory includes a couple of novelties -- Clara Schumann's Romance in D flat and a work by an English composer, Dave Maric -- along with Stravinsky's ''Suite Italienne,'' Schubert's Fantasy in C (D. 934) and the Ravel Violin Sonata. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $23 to $74.  KOZINN    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Riccardo Muti, who usually can't get enough of his homeland, must be relieved to get away from Italy for the moment, after the travails leading up to his resignation as music director of the Teatro Alla Scala in Milan on April 2. New Yorkers have taken a special interest in the fracas, since the Philharmonic, which courted Mr. Muti avidly but vainly before hiring Lorin Maazel, will, barring any further extension of Mr. Maazel's contract, soon be back in the market to replace him in 2009. Here Philharmonic audiences will get another look and listen at close hand, as Mr. Muti conducts Liszt's ''Faust Symphony'' and a work by Goffredo Petrassi. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    'SEPTETS AND OCTETS' This is the last in a series of concerts at the Miller Theater that has been pairing masterworks from the chamber music repertory with comparably great works from the 20th and 21st centuries. Tomorrow night's program presents Schubert's popular Octet in F with Schoenberg's inventive Septet Suite in E flat, Op. 29. The starry roster of performers, many of whom play regularly with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, includes, in part, the clarinetist Charles Neidich, the hornist William Purvis, the violinist Ida Kavafian, the cellist Fred Sherry and the pianist Christopher Oldfather. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $25.  TOMMASINI    ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA With his orchestra's labor problems in abeyance, David Robertson brings the St. Louis Symphony to Carnegie Hall. The talented Mr. Robertson is American and relatively young, and his program reflects both situations. The music of Ives begins and ends the evening with first ''The Unanswered Question'' and last the Second Symphony. In between come Copland's ''Lincoln Portrait'' with none other than Paul Newman as narrator and John Adams's ''Century Rolls.'' St. Louis seems eager to have Mr. Robertson, and it offers him an excellent place to learn the American orchestra business at his own pace. Sometimes the right people find each other at the right time. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $24 to $82.  HOLLAND    ANNE SOFIE VON OTTER You can not brand classical music as elitist when there are so many free or affordable concerts to take in all over New York, notably the ''Free for All at Town Hall'' series. On Sunday afternoon this essential series of free concerts presents the rich-voiced and intelligent mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter in a recital program with the pianist Bengt Forsberg, her longtime colleague. The program offers songs by Mozart, Haydn and Schubert as well as Haydn's solo cantata ''Arianna a Naxos.'' Interspersed among the vocal works Mr. Forsberg will play solo pieces by J.C. Bach and Schubert. Sunday at 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)707-8787. Tickets are available for free (two per person) at the Town Hall box office starting at noon.

DUNNING    * LES BALLETS GRANDIVA These winsome male ballerinas will perform a repertory that includes affectionate spoofs of dance by Gerald Arpino, Kenneth MacMillan, George Balanchine and Fokine, Petipa and others in two programs. Tonight (Program A) and tomorrow (B) at 8 p.m., Symphony Space, Broadway and 95th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-5400. Tickets: $25; $15 for students, children and 65+.  DUNNING    * HAROLD (STUMPY) CROMER AND FRIENDS Mr. Cromer, who has been tap-dancing since 1929, will be joined by Megan Haungs, Traci Mann and Toes Tiranoff, with Frank Owen on the piano, in ''The Truth Lies Here,'' a salute to April. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Cobi's Place, 158 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (516)922-2010. Tickets: $20.  DUNNING    CHRIS FERRIS AND DANCERS A concert of five dances created within the last two years features dynamic movements within intricate spatial designs. Ms. Ferris's pieces explore contrasts between improvised and set choreography, the way interruptions cause a bouncing sequence to grow erratic and differences between falling into partners' arms and falling to the floor. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham, Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (718)672-6965. Tickets: $15.  JACK ANDERSON    FLAMENCO LATINO You don't have to be Spanish to dance flamenco. That might be the motto of the company, directed by Aurora Reyes and Basilio Georges, which will perform in the closest thing they could find to a taverna. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11 p.m., Alegrias at La Nacional, 239 West 14th Street, West Village, (212)399-8519. Admission: $10 cover charge.  DUNNING    * MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY The current crop of Graham dancers may not look like the ones who originated their roles in the dances from the 1930's into the 50's that will be performed this weekend. These are different times. But this generation suggests that Graham's choreography can be simultaneously exalting and entertaining, particularly in Program B (tonight and Sunday afternoon). In this closing weekend, the company will present a family matinee tomorrow with a post-performance ''Meet the Dancers'' session Martha Clarke's new ''Suenos'' may be seen, along with Graham pieces, tomorrow and Sunday nights. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan (212)581-1212. Tickets: $24 to $80.  DUNNING    NEIL GREENBERG Mr. Greenberg's new ''Partial View,'' with music by Zeena Parkins and video by John Jesurun, isn't quite so magical as his last video and dance piece. But it is handsome looking and begins with a haunting solo danced by the choreographer. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $25; $15 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    * LINCOLN CENTER 'NEW VISIONS': TRISHA BROWN DANCE COMPANY This trend-setting modern-dance troupe will celebrate its 35th anniversary with two programs. The first (tonight) explores Ms. Brown's choreographic collaborations with Robert Rauschenberg. The second (tomorrow night) includes two New York premieres and the recent ''Geometry of Quiet.'' Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Rose Hall, Time Warner Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)721-6500 or www.lincolncenter.org. Tickets: $45.  DUNNING    DAVID NEUMANN Mr. Neumann, one of downtown dance's most intriguing performers, teams up in his new ''tough, the tough'' with the filmmaker Hal Hartley and the playwright Will Eno in a work that ''exposes the cognitive maps and geopolitical boundaries that define imaginary landscape inside us and out.'' Consider yourselves warned, possums. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194. Tickets: $15 or TDF voucher.  DUNNING    * NEW YORK THEATER BALLET A discreet little pearl in the oyster of New York dance this weekend, the program features such little known works as Frederick Ashton's 1930 ''Capriol Suite,'' Antony Tudor's ''Main Gauches'' and ''Judgment of Paris,'' Sallie Wilson's ''Romeo and Juliet'' balcony scene and Ron Sequoio's ''Rondo for Seven,'' as well as a tribute to Bobby Short by Lois Bewley and a new ballet by company member Danielle Genest. Tonight and tomorrow (and next Friday and Saturday) at 7:30 p.m., Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. Tickets: $30; $15 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    NORANEWDANCECO Nora Stephens, a choreographer and video artist, collaborates with composers Ryan Smith and Jeff Snyder on a multimedia program featuring ''Finding You When,'' a new work that concerns connections and misconnections during the course of a lifetime. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, (917)843-9470. Tickets: $12.  ANDERSON    * NRITYAGRAM DANCE ENSEMBLE A company established in 1990 to preserve India's 2000-year old dance traditions offers a program featuring Odissi, the oldest of India's classical dance forms performed by an ensemble of six dancers, three instrumentalists and a singer. Originally a sacred ritual, Odissi conveys spirituality through a sensuous flow of movement marked by lyrical curving gestures that bring to life ancient Indian sculptures. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $38.  ANDERSON    LESLIE SATIN AND DANCERS A choreographer known for her rigor offers the premiere of ''Under Cover,'' a collaboration with the video artist Andrew Gurian that evokes a mysterious disturbing moment through a succession of elusive details. The production features three dancers; Iris Rose, an actress who recites a complex text by Ms. Satin, and Roy Nathanson, a saxophonist. Tonight and Sunday at 8, Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, Manhattan,(212)924-7882. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    * STREB S.L.A.M. Ms. Streb's Frequent Flyers -- she's not kidding -- will soar, crash and dodge through dances new and familiar for two more weeks at her Brooklyn studio-theater. Popcorn served. Tonight and tomorrow at 7, Sunday at 3 p.m. Through May 1., S.L.A.M., 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)384-6491. Tickets: $15 adults; $10 children; free for children under 4.  DUNNING    ANDREA WOODS/SOULOWORKS Ms. Woods combines live performance solos with her videodances in a program called ''Bird of Pray,'' with guest artist Hattie Gossett. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Thalia at Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-5400. Tickets: $21; $18 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    YOUTH AMERICA GRAND PRIX 2005 For those who can't get enough of international ballet competitions, this one was created by former Bolshoi Ballet dancers Gennadi (now at American Ballet Theater) and Larissa Saveliev and offers scholarships for ballet training to dancers from 9 to 19, with the grand prize a contract to the ABT Studio Company. Tonight (contemporary dance round) from 6 to 11 p.m.; tomorrow (classical ballet round) from noon to 10 p.m.; Sunday (final round) from 5 to 7 p.m., Martin Luther King High School Auditorium, Amsterdam Avenue and 65th Street, Manhattan. Admission: $10 per round at the door. The competition ends with a gala in which winners perform with dancers from companies including the Royal Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet and MOMIX. Monday at 7:30 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-1212. Tickets: $15 to $100.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression, the emotions that reveal themselves after her best pictures leave their first impression, which is often alarm. She captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and -- this probably applies as much to Arbus as to any other photographer of the second half of the last century -- she captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some maddeningly dark, dense and absurdly theatrical galleries, like chapels, of memorabilia. That said, it touches her favorite subjects with grace. Even the shocking photographs of retarded women are sympathetic, implying that the world is full of wondrous things, if our eyes are open enough to recognize them, and that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $7 and 65+, $10.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 88th Street, (212)423-3500, through June 8. The latest artist to be given Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim to play with, Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering construction, 81 feet tall, the corner of what would be a cube large enough to enclose the rotunda, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections, which predictably shift and shimmy in slightly queasy-making fashion along with your movement up or down the ramp. There is not much to the work beyond that. The museum's ramps are empty. Alternative panes of the circular skylight are colored with magenta gels, making a kind of checkerboard pattern. This is pretty. Short kelly-green stripes of tape are stuck below the outside rim of the rotunda's parapet. These are not attractive. A suite of Mr. Buren's colored striped paintings from the late 1960's and 70's are eccentrically aligned, Salon style, on adjacent walls of the museum's High Gallery and reflect through the gallery's doorway in the mirrors. They are at once boring and precious. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $15; students and 65+, $10.  KIMMELMAN    'CHERISHED POSSESSIONS: A NEW ENGLAND LEGACY,' Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street (212)501-3000, through June 5. More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, Historic New England (formerly the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities), appear in this show, from such humble objects as a relic box containing two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait (1793) of Richard Codman, a handsome profligate from Boston known for his wit, charm and lavish spending. What makes the show different from hundreds of others devoted to American antiques is that, thanks in no small part to bright captioning, it does convey a sense of family connection with the objects. And it gets into the 20th century with modernist furnishings from the Massachusetts home of Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus, who left Hitler's Germany in 1938 for a teaching post at Harvard. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $3.  GRACE GLUECK    SUE DE BEER, 'BLACK SUN,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (800)944-8639, through June 24. Shown in a simplified, walk-in, pink castle, ""Black Sun"" is a Paul McCarthyesque video projected on two screens about teenage girlhood that alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. Though it is tempered by irony, the psychological urgency suggests that Ms. de Beer, who is in her early 30's, is still wrestling with her own adolescent conflicts about being good, being bad and being loved. Hours: Mondays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: free.  KEN JOHNSON    * 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA', Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212)288-6400 and at the Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows, Corona Park, Queens, (718)592-9700 both through June 5. Also, ""Fatal Love: South Asian American Art Now,"" Queens Museum of Art through June 5. ""Edge of Desire,"" spread over two venues, is a highly selective, multi-generational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India. The senior figure here, K.G. Subramanyan, born in 1924, has over the years embraced craft, folk, and tribal traditions, as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The show does the same in work from mid-career figures like Nalini Malani and Vivan Sundaram, to newcomers like Shilpa Gupta, Swarna and Manu Chitrakar, and L.N. Tallur. The smaller portion of the show is at Asia Society; the more expansive and varied section in Queens. Also in Queens is ""Fatal Love,"" a lively but subtle showcase of young artists, many of them women, many living in New York. This show alone is worth a trip to Flushing Meadows. Park Avenue location hours: Tuesdays through Sundays 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; 65+, $7; students with ID, $5; members and under 16, free.  HOLLAND COTTER    ""MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE"" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through July 10. Max Ernst (1891-1976) is one of modernism's mystery men. He is everywhere in the history of European art between the wars, closely associated with two of the century's wild-and-craziest movements, Dada and Surrealism, yet he never quite materializes. Both despite and because of his elusiveness he remains an artist of some interest, and there are intriguing things in this large survey. They range from some of the earliest paintings to be officially labeled Surrealist, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to examples of the collage-style books some consider Ernst's masterworks. On the positive side, his refusal of a signature style is evidence of his anti-authoritarian instincts. Too often, however, it produced art that looks like brilliant busywork. Only when he is responding to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. Hours and admission: see above.  COTTER    * TIM HAWKINSON, Whitney Museum of American Art, Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212)570-3676, through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Tim Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. Each requires some head-scratching decipherment, inviting admiration for its doggedness, while not straining too hard to earn a viewer's love. Feats of physical fancy, when so dizzily executed, can be their own justification. Mr. Hawkinson's larger purpose, you might say, is simply wonderment. At the same time the art borrows a healthy strain of ludicrous wit from Samuel Beckett, who knew a thing or two about how to clown around smartly. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Friday 1 to 9 p.m.; closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50; children 12 and under, free.  KIMMELMAN    * 'HUGO BOSS PRIZE 2004: RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA,' Solomon R. Guggeheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, through May 11. For his Guggenheim solo show, Rikrit Tirvanija, winner of the 2004 Hugo Boss prize, has built a low-power television station from inexpensive materials in one of the museum's galleries, and papered the walls with instructions on how anyone and everyone can do the same. What looks like a glorified science-fair project comes with specific social context. The airwaves, which carry transmissions, are technically United States government property. Unlicensed broadcast is illegal and licenses are hard to get. Federal control of its communications resources has further tightened in recent years, inspiring a wave of illegal transmissions from stations like this one, which could contribute to grassroots protest against perceived restrictions on first amendment rights. Here, Mr. Tiravanija's art-linked-to-life aesthetic moves outside the art-world to the real world, a significant, potentially far-reaching shift. Hours and admission: see above.  COTTER    'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street (212)832-1155, through July 24. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture and its high incidence of mushroom clouds, bionic heroes, building-crunching monsters and hyper-cute cartoon characters. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami (of Vuitton bag fame), and organized in collaboration with the Public Arts Fund, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced the work of younger artists like Yoshitomo Nara, Chinatsu Ban and the artist currently known as Mr.  ROBERTA SMITH    'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, through June 6. More than 100 faces make up the cast of this show. The portraits were shot by 35 photographers active in the two countries, among them Lotte Jacobi, Josef Albers, Gisele Freund, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and August Sander. Their images not only give a sense of the rich cultural life in Austria and Germany before the Nazis but also help trace the history of photography during the period. More important, this savvy show homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values.  GLUECK    * 'CY TWOMBLY: FIFTY YEARS OF WORKS ON PAPER,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212)570-3676, through May 8. Despite the ""works on paper"" label, this is basically a show of paintings. It starts in the 1950's, when Mr. Twombly, closely entwined with the artist Robert Rauschenberg, developed a personal anti-aesthetic in which scribbling was a form draftsmanship, gouging and scratching was gestural painting. After moving to Italy, words appeared frequently in the work: obscenities, the names of gods, quotations from Roman epics, scraps of Romantic poetry. It was as if Western cultural history was unfolding on the walls of a toilet stall. Closer to the present the work turns lush and perfumed, into a kind of horticultural expressionism that is both appetizing and uningratiating. Hours and admission: see above.  COTTER    Galleries: Uptown    PETER HOWSON, 'CHRISTOS ANESTE,' Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue at 77th Street, (212)439-1700, through May 7. Working with a sharp pencil on small square panels in a profusely detailed, expressionistic and sometimes hallucinatory style that harks back to the Northern Renaissance, this British artist brings impressive skill and tragi-comic verve to subjects like the trials of Jesus, the temptation of St. Anthony and the delusions of Don Quixote. His small, brushy and comparatively sentimental paintings are disappointing, but there are fewer of them.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    * '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLIMT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. This fascinating and beautiful exhibition presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. The Swedish af Klimt and the Swiss Kunz were mystics for whom drawing was a way to represent or channel supernatural dimensions of the universe. Martin, on the other hand, was a Modernist more interested in the Zen-esque experience of the here and now in art and nature.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    ERIC FISCHL, Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, (212)752-2929, through April 23. Like the ones in his last show at this gallery, Mr. Fischl's paintings are based on his own photographs of hired models behaving like jaded sophisticates during a daytime love-making session or at home after a late night party. The paintings are suavely made with wide brushes in muted colors and they capture complex patterns of light broken up by venetian blinds. But a frustrating vagueness about what is going on in the pictures limits the psychological intrigue.  JOHNSON    MARK HEYER, Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212)675-2656, through April 23. Mr. Heyer's small, folksy narrative paintings of subjects like a tornado approaching a Midwestern farm, a circus act under the big top and sexy women getting dressed in their rooms look as if they were made in the 1920's and 30's by a simple-minded colleague of Edward Hopper and Charles Burchfield. That they are actually clever Postmodernist simulations does not prevent them from being nostalgically enchanting.  JOHNSON    'IAN KIAER: THE GREY CLOTH' Tanya Bonakdar Gallery 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea (212)414-4144, through April 30. Inspired by a little-known 1914 novel by the German architecture critic Paul Scheerbart, the five installation pieces in this show work quite well as a neurasthenic environment whose arrangements of pale monochromes and pale found objects abjectly elegize the building blocks of modernism.  SMITH    JONAS MEKAS: 'FRAGMENTS OF PARADISE,' Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212)366-1549, through April 30. Born in Lithuania in 1922, Mr. Mekas survived a Nazi forced labor camp to become one of the most influential and revered members of the New York avant garde film-making community. This retrospective sampler presents short and long, typically low-production, diaristic films from the past five decades on video screens. Also, a cacophonous, 12-monitor installation shows 24 hours in the life of the artist and his family, a piece that was inspired by an idea of Ferdinand Leger's.  JOHNSON    HERVÉ DI ROSA: 'THE SOLO GROUP SHOW,' Haim Chanin, 210 Eleventh Avenue at 24th Street, (646)230-7200, through April 23. An antic chameleon of an artist, this French Neo-Popster presents more than 500 small, framed paintings and drawings in four large clusters. Mr. di Rosa's ability to imitate many different styles -- including underground comics, geometric abstraction, Surrealism and realism -- is impressive, but it is the gleeful irreverence and love of absurdity holding it all together that wins you over.  JOHNSON    MAGNUS VON PLESSEN, Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street (212)206-9300, through April 23. In the artist's eagerness to suggest fluctuating moods and rapid shifting of perceptions, and to avoid the ""literalness"" that painting can fall into, he puts down fugitive images (often derived initially from photographs) that are done in by paint or the lack of it. One example is ""Discontinued,"" a large teetery structure that amounts to a suggestion of a building with most of its vitals left out. Paint, or its strategic omission, the artist seems to say, trumps imagery. In more talented hands, this is often true, but not here.  GLUECK    Last Chance    JOHN ALTOON: 'PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS, 1961-67,' Luise Ross Gallery, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212)343-2161, closing tomorrow. In the last years of his short life, Altoon (1925-1969) broke out of the freewheeling West Coast mode of Abstract Expressionism to zero in on more personal images -- some dreamy, others explicitly sexual, still others biomorphic doodles -- that floated through his fantasy. One of the most amusing -- and accessible -- of these works is ''Untitled (Bathtub)'' of 1967. It depicts a woman bathing as a poodle awaits her emergence. But her attention is riveted on a small demonic man who has set fire to her bath water. Altoon's deft, light touch mates well with his fine sense of the silly.  GLUECK    ALYSON SHOTZ, 'MOMENT IN TIME AND SPACE,' Derek Eller, 526-30 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-6411, closing tomorrow. This resourceful sculptor has hung an expansive, undulating, floor-to-ceiling curtain in the middle of the gallery. It was made by stapling together thousands of ovals cut from plastic magnifying sheets. The kaleidoscopic optical effects are delightfully confounding.  JOHNSON    STANLEY WHITNEY, Esso, 531 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)560-9728, closing tomorrow You might not have thought the tired old genre of grid-based abstract painting still had in it works as buoyantly radiant as these. Painted with a dry, flat and slightly brushy touch, Mr. Whitney's blocks of near-pure color, separated by horizontal bands like books on a bookshelf, have a syncopated chromatic rhythm that is a pleasure to behold.
