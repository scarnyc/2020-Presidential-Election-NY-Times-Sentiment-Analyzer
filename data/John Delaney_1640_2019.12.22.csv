Broadway    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Is there room on Broadway for another odd couple of singing con men? On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' directed by Jack O'Brien and starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a queasy slouch. Though shot through a rowdy spirit of self-parody, the show (with songs by David Yazbek) seems to believe in its own brazen agenda only when the criminally talented Mr. Butz commands the stage. (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $41.25 to $101. 25. BEN BRANTLEY    +'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' Memory, which is notorious for playing tricks on people, pulls off some doozies in this narcoticized production of Tennessee Williams's classic drama. Staged by David Leveaux, this revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea through which people swim slowly and blindly. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange, who brings a sleepy, neurotic sensuality to the role of the vital and domineering Amanda Wingfield, and Christian Slater, who is a red-hot firebrand as her poetical son, Tom (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25. BRANTLEY    *'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people (including the cast) that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience among school-age children and grown-ups in touch with the nerdy, nose-thumbing 12-year-olds within. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a cast that includes Tim Curry, David Hyde Pierce, Hank Azaria and the toothsome scenery chewer Sara Ramirez (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25. BRANTLEY    +*'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, directed by Anthony Page and starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners. Tempering the play's notorious vitriol with eye-opening compassion, this interpretation restores characters who have acquired the faces of Freudian monsters to purely human form. In following Mr. Albee's account of a couple's long-night's journey into dawn, Mr. Page and company affectingly scale a masterpiece back from operatic excess to the tautness of a chamber work (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $91.25. BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    +'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion. Staking no claim to artistic significance, it makes a nice sound, looks pretty (if you like pretty boys) and sends you home with a smile. The show comprises a dozen sly parodies cooked up by the skilled songwriters Gary Adler and Michael Patrick Walker, with winking choruses like, ''Girl, you make me want to wait.'' All the guys have terrific voices and nimble limbs, and each gets a moment to linger in the solo spotlight. (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $66 to $69. CHARLES ISHERWOOD    ++'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their steadfast belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause. An earnest, inert musical about the unlikely friendship forged between a white woman and an escaped slave in the South in the 1840's, it's a long, dreary sermon in song. Individual songs are affecting, and director-choreographer Graciela Daniele stages some numbers effectively, but the scope of the musical is too broad, and its tone is too pedagogical, for even the two central characters to detach themselves from the burden of the narrative and establish their true humanity (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $75. ISHERWOOD    *'HOUSE/LIGHTS' The Wooster Group made the right choice when it selected ''House/Lights'' to embody its three decades of work. This technically dazzling production, based on a Gertrude Stein libretto, uses simulcast video monitors and voice-layering synthesizers to spin everything that is said and done into an orbit of multiple effects. The effect is as exhilarating as it is disorienting, capturing the impact of technology-driven life in a way that flat film and computer imagery never can. The subject may be dehumanization, but the cast is among the most vital and theatrically disciplined you will ever see. (1:10) St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718)254-8779. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays; $37 Fridays through Sundays. BRANTLEY    +'INKY' Beware the nanny with bruised knuckles. That's the only cogent conclusion to draw from Rinne Groff's peculiar and unfocused comedy about the competitive ethics of the 1980's. The title is the odd nickname for the odd main character, a Manhattan au pair obsessed with Muhammad Ali. Inky is played by a talented newcomer to the New York stage, Jessi Campbell. The play traces her influence on her employers, a harried young businessman and his demanding wife. Unfortunately, Ms. Groff is too vague in her use of boxing symbolism, and too loose in her observation of character, for her ideas about the aridity of the rat race to hit home (1:20). Women's Project, at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $47. ISHERWOOD    'THE LAST DAYS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT' This latest work from the author of ''Jesus Hopped the A Train'' brings to mind an unusually lively senior-class project. Thank heaven -- a subject much discussed in this debate of a drama about the Bible's most famous betrayal -- that at least the person in charge is the class cutup. And that he is popular enough to recruit some really cool friends (including Eric Bogosian, Sam Rockwell and the show's director, Philip Seymour Hoffman). Still, the colorful vernacular speech and flashy performances can't disguise the impression that the play is a heavily footnoted position paper on a big, big subject (2:40) . Public Theater/Martinson Hall, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50. BRANTLEY    + 'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: Things will look a lot more impressive than they actually are if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind ''Lazer Vaudeville,'' a show with lots of color, not much substance and a future asterisk: it is the last production in the John Houseman Theater, slated for demolition. The show is a hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by Carter Brown, Cindy Marvell and Nicholas Flair, who are moderately engaging but don't seem to be having quite enough fun. Ms. Marvell is a first-class juggler and never disappoints, and there's a funny little hat fandango involving all three, but some of the men's bits and ensemble pieces don't have much wow factor Perhaps the three know they are short on razzmatazz, because they constantly shut off the lights and let their glow-in-the-dark ropes and batons do the talking (1:30). John Houseman Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 11 a.m., 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $45. NEIL GENZLINGER    'MONK' Rome Neal eases his way through this solo play about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, taking his time to tell the story of an artist he clearly loves. Mr. Neal drops a few names and recounts career high and low-lights. He even pauses to dance during musical interludes, composed by Bill Lee. Laurence Holder's workmanlike script fits Mr. Neal like a glove. It's full of laid-back lines like ''trial and error, baby, that's my school'' or ''you dig, well, I dug.'' However, this is not the show for jazz fans that want to delve deep into Monk's psychology or learn something new about his process. It's like a pleasant evening with an old friend, not an emotional ride. In one telling moment, Monk says: ''I'm enigmatic. I'm weird. I'm me'' (1:30). Abingdon Theater Compalex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-2055. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45. JASON ZINOMAN    ++'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in the case of ''The Musical of Musicals!'' Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $56 to $59.50. MARGO JEFFERSON    'ON SECOND AVENUE' Can a perfectly calibrated ensemble production also be a star vehicle? Apparently so, because that's what this Folksbiene Yiddish Theater's revival is. Six appealing performers with six fine voices share roughly equal time delivering songs and shtick from the heyday of Yiddish theater, yet the show's biggest name, the American/Israeli actor Mike Burstyn, shines all that much brighter in his solo moments. This zippy revue, first seen in the 1980's, has aphorisms (''He who digs a grave for others will himself fall in'') and sassy couplets and lots and lots of songs. ''In the theater, we saw ourselves,'' Mr. Burstyn summarizes in one interlude, and the music covers the spectrum of human emotions: love, regret, envy, self-parody. Some of the material is delivered in Yiddish, with supertitles provided, though they're hardly worth the trouble: the performers convey all the meaning that's needed. English, though, takes over for a priceless barrage of jokes delivered vaudeville-style by Mr. Burstyn. ''Two Jewish cannibals,'' he begins, but the rest won't be spoiled here (2:00) . JCC in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, (212)213-2120. Wednesdays and Thursdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $45. GENZLINGER    +*''S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success. Mr. Pendleton, an actor and acting teacher, reimagines this theatrical footnote as a quietly momentous turning point in the emotional and professional lives of everyone involved, including Olivier's outgoing and incoming wives, Vivien Leigh and Joan Plowright, and the critic Kenneth Tynan. While Mr. Pendleton smartly exploits the frailties of these graying artistic lions for comedy, there is an abiding respect and affection in his irreverence and in the fastidious performances of director David Cromer's fine cast (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: 55. ISHERWOOD    *'PLAY WITHOUT WORDS' The erotic possibilities multiply before your eyes in Matthew Bourne's frisky homage to London in the Swinging 60's. The square root of this witty dance play is unquestionably the pas de deux, but the math gets tricky when you consider that each of the five main characters is played by two or three performers, who often share the stage and sometimes move in tandem. Mr. Bourne has transformed a touchstone movie of the 1960s, Joseph Losey's macabre study in power games, ''The Servant,'' into a swirling stage play rewritten in suggestive shrugs, tangled limbs and smoldering glances. It's fresh, inventive and very sexy (1:45). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $75. ISHERWOOD    'ROMANCE' Listen up, you mugs. Nobody makes fun of David Mamet, see, because David Mamet can take care of that all by hisself. In the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, Mr. Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either. Neil Pepe directs an irreproachable but ineffective cast that includes Larry Bryggman and Bob Balaban (1:35). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55. BRANTLEY    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. It reflects precisely in its disorienting rhythms and colors the range of perceptions embedded in the monologue. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45. ISHERWOOD    +'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson and directed by Casey Childs, the play is gaudy and moderately fun, basically a big chunk of theatrical costume jewelry. It concentrates, as these borderline morbid celebrity showcases often do, on the declining arc of its subject's worldly career, and gives us the usual generous doses of dysfunction and despair beneath the glittering resume. Ms. Ruehl gives a vigorous, enjoyably big performance, but even her hard work can't inflate the flatter stretches in the writing (1:40). Promenade Theater, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25. ISHERWOOD    Off Off Broadway    'PENTECOST' The Barrow Group's inaugural production in its new theater couldn't be much more ambitious: the New York premiere of ''Pentecost,'' a 1994 drama by the British playwright David Edgar. Written in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the play tackles everything from the origin of Western Renaissance art to America's pop-cultural hegemony to hostage negotiations. The writing is engaging and the staging keeps things moving. It's too bad, though, that Mr. Edgar didn't just stick with revolutionizing art history rather than trying to revolutionize the world (2:45). Barrow Group Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Mondays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $40. PHOEBE HOBAN    Last Chance    'BROOKLYN BOY' One of the mortifications of middle age is being forced to admit the truth in those extra-mossy clichés that you mock when you are young and arrogant. The past always catches up with you; blood is thicker than water; be careful what you wish for. These are among the stale-but-true bromides that are acknowledged by the title character in Donald Margulies's sincere but doggedly unsurprising new play about the midlife crisis of a suddenly successful novelist (Adam Arkin). While this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: make the familiar seem fresh. Polly Draper and Ari Graynor stand out in an excellent cast, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan (2:20). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $79. BRANTLEY    'GHETTO SUPERSTAR (THE MAN THAT I AM)' Midway through this musical autobiography, Billy Porter describes the moment that changed his life: His teenage encounter, via the Tony Awards telecast, with Jennifer Holliday's galvanizing performance of ''And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.'' Those emotions play roles in this unabashedly sentimental show, but they ultimately take a back seat to righteous flamboyance. The hallmarks of Mr. Porter's personal history will not be revelations to theatergoers who have accompanied other gay men in the performing arts on similar journeys through shame and confusion to self-acceptance. But Mr. Porter's performance of various pop songs, show tunes and original compositions is vibrant and enjoyable. (1:40). Public Theater, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7; tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at 9:30 p.m. Tickets: $45. ISHERWOOD    'GORILLA MAN' The usual afflictions befalling teenage boys -- acne, scuffed skateboards, the indifference of that girl in homeroom -- pale in comparison to the plight of Billy, the hero of this pop musical by Kyle Jarrow. Billy wakes one morning to find he is turning into a man-eating beast. Lonely and confused, he sets out to find the father who bequeathed him the genes that brought on this misfortune. On a deeper level, he seeks an answer to the profound question that has stumped philosophers, theologians and adolescents for at least a couple of millennia: ''Why me?'' There are many laughs in Mr. Jarrow's self-consciously silly book and well-tailored pop-rock songs, but the show's overall conception, which layers horror-movie melodramatics over a pseudo-earnest inquiry into questions of fate and free will, is ultimately juvenile (1:20). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 p.m.; Sunday at 6 p.m. Tickets: $15. ISHERWOOD    +'I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE' The prolific British novelist J.B. Priestley was fascinated by the concept of time, and his play suggests that individuals repeat their life cycles until they break free from past mistakes. Based partly on the author's readings of the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky, the theory is described in the play by the mysterious German émigré Dr. Görtler. Dr. Görtler, like the five other characters at the Black Bull Inn on the moors of North Yorkshire in 1937, is a mechanical device for the working out of the Priestley-Ouspensky puzzle. And as demonstrated by the Pearl Theater Company cast, in what the troupe says is the first revival of the play in New York since it appeared on Broadway in 1938, where it flopped, there isn't much wiggle room when you are a device instead of a character. Symbolism aside, the pleasure of the evening is in watching the players move about with easy familiarity (all have worked together before at the Pearl), under Gus Kaikkonen's direction, on the snug, rose-colored set by Takeshi Kata with its four clocks that tick and chime at melodramatic moments. (2:30) Pearl Theater Company, Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $50. ANDREA STEVENS    'PULLMAN, WA' This new avant-garde work by Young Jean Lee has the deadpan simplicity of the plays of Richard Maxwell and the awkward, secretly suffering angst of a teenage diarist working through an identity crisis. Artifice is the enemy. There are no props or set (outside of two chairs); the lights never change; and the costumes look like the clothes that the actors might have worn to the movies earlier in the day. The play begins when Pete Simpson, a dead-eyed and strangely hypnotic actor, walks onstage and tells the audience that he know how to live. Don't get your hopes up. The entire play could be seen as a send-up of the self-help industry, a dry comment on its tough love and easy answers. It will surely not win over many who are already skeptical about experimental theater. But while this is not a major work, it is an honest one that takes itself seriously -- and that is refreshing (1:00) . Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Tonight and tomorrow at 7 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $15. ZINOMAN    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance. HOBAN    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. *denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BE COOL' Directed by F. Gary Gray. Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Christina Milian (PG-13, 112 minutes). In ''Be Cool,'' Mr. Travolta, wearing black and the glazed look of the overly pampered and chronically bored, returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in Barry Sonnenfeld's 1995 adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel ''Get Shorty.'' That movie arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction,'' which in turn owed a serviceable debt to Mr. Leonard's oeuvre. But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, largely propelled by Mr. Travolta's star presence and a screenplay from Scott Frank, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty, fueled by nothing more than the faintest of vapors left over from those earlier successes. The new film was written by Peter Steinfeld, whose draggy, generally unfunny screenplay packs in a lot of the same characters from the Leonard novel (the sequel to ''Get Shorty'') and too much of its overworked, conceptually anemic plot. MANOHLA DARGIS    'CONSTANTINE' Starring Keanu Reeves. Directed by Francis Lawrence (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Mr. Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. He is John Constantine, who travels back and forth between our world and the one below, working as a kind of freelance border guard, sending stray demons back into the fiery depths. But something big is brewing, involving rebel angels, the son of Satan, and a whole lot of pseudo-biblical mumbo jumbo. Assisting Mr. Reeves are Rachel Weisz, as a Los Angeles police detective whose sister has jumped off a roof, and Shia LeBoeuf as an eager dabbler in the occult. Tilda Swinton is the angel Gabriel, doing a bit of slumming after boffo work in Milton's ''Paradise Lost.'' A.O. SCOTT    'DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN' Starring Kimberly Elise, Tyler Perry and Cicely Tyson. Directed by Darren Grant. (PG-13, 116 minutes). This movie is so oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce. As the story of a cruelly abandoned wife's reascendance zigzags from soap opera to slapstick to church sermon and back, it goes from A to Z on the all-things-to-all-people meter: Cinderella meets Amos 'n' Andy in Sunday school, so to speak. STEPHEN HOLDEN    'DOWNFALL' Starring Bruno Ganz. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (No rating, 155 minutes; in German, with English subtitles). Mr. Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses around him, and the Red Army closes in. Surrounding him are his followers, some fanatically loyal, others wavering in the face of defeat, who must all play out the endgame of their ghastly world-historical project. Mr. Hirschsbiegel's film, taking place at the moment when the energies of Nazism turned from murder to suicide, is engrossing and well made, but it does not generate much feeling beyond a queasy, prurient fascination. Its most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. SCOTT    *'GUNNER PALACE' Directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. (PG-13, 86 minutes). Mr. Tucker spent several months in late 2003 and early 2004 in Baghdad recording the lives and words of members of the Army's 2/3 Field Artillery division (known as the Gunners), who were living in an opulent, bomb-damaged palace that once belonged to Uday Hussein. The resulting film is raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. We accompany them on raids and patrols, witness their moments of leisure, and hear their own conflicted responses to their experiences, conveyed through jokes, video diaries, poems and hip-hop freestyling. Whatever your opinions of the war in Iraq, this film will provide a necessary jolt of confusion, which is the first step toward an unsentimental understanding of who the American troops are and what they face. SCOTT    'HOSTAGE' Directed by Florent Siri. Starring Bruce Willis and Kevin Pollak (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Mr. Willis's fading career as an action hero. The star plays a former hostage negotiator who has exiled himself to a quiet southern California town after a botched standoff. He springs back into action when the cliff-hugging mansion of a crooked book-cooking corporate accountant (Mr. Pollak) is simultaneously invaded by a posse of teenage punks and by a S.W.A.T. team of high-tech gangsters. The fiery demolition of this architectural monstrosity in which the accountant lives with his two children is the only thing worth applauding in this mess of film. HOLDEN    'IN MY COUNTRY' Directed by John Boorman. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of the high-minded but hopelessly wooden film that examines the public hearings conducted by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the late 1990's. At the hearings, victims of human rights abuse during Apartheid confronted the perpetrators in court, both sides seeking ''ubuntu,'' or forgiveness instead of revenge. Mr. Jackson is an American reporter who brings his own angry racial agenda to the hearings. The screenplay, by Ann Peacock, who adapted the story from Antjie Krog's memoir, ''Country of My Skull,'' makes the fatal mistake of turning characters into mouthpieces engaged in stiff, point-counterpoint moral debate. HOLDEN    *'INTIMATE STORIES' Directed by Carlos Sorin. Starring Javier Lombardo (not rated, 92 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The modest gem of Argentine film, set in Patagonia, conveys starkly and unemotionally what it really feels like to live in a wilderness with next to nothing. For the characters who wouldn't understand the concept of upward mobility, this is simply the way life is. The story interweaves vignettes of travelers from the same rural village bound for the provincial capital 200 miles away. One is an old man (Antonio Bendectis), who takes to the road to find his runaway dog; another is a single mother (Javiera Bravo) who becomes a contestant on a TV game show; the third (Mr. Lombardo); is a traveling salesman. The journey promises redemption to one, riches to another, and true love to a third. HOLDEN    'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (NC-17, 90 minutes). It was the image seen -- cheered and jeered, canonized and demonized -- around the world. In 1972 Linda Lovelace, nee Linda Boreman, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat,'' played the role that would bequeath her a tawdry and lasting celebrity. With a single act of extreme fellatio, this dazed and often confused 23-year-old became a pinup for the party animal's sexual revolution and, in time, a martyr in the crusade against pornography. But as is clear from this lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary, Ms. Boreman was also little more than a pawn, an empty vessel for opportunists from both sides of the pornography divide. The documentary is a ''slam, bam, thank you, ma'am'' trifle of an entertainment, one strategically packaged for Generation A.D.D. DARGIS    'THE JACKET' Directed by John Maybury. Starring Adrien Brody (R, 102 minutes). Mr. Brody plays Jack Starks, a soldier in the first Gulf War who survives a bullet wound to the head, fixes a pickup truck in Vermont, and is then sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. There, things get really weird, as a sinister doctor (Kris Kristofferson) straps him into a jacket and shoves him in a drawer, in the name of some misguided therapeutic ideal, or perhaps just because he is a sadistic brute. The drawer, or maybe the jacket, enables Jack to propel himself forward in time, where he meets Keira Knightley, playing a lonely, hard-drinking waitress. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks, and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. In his less hyperactive moments, Mr. Maybury is able to conjure a mood of tenderness and menace, and Mr. Brody's haunted intelligence goes nicely with Ms. Knightley's jumpy intensity. The picture starts out trying to be craftily clever and ends up artlessly dumb, which is to say that it improves as it goes along, sliding from jumped-up paranoia into squishy sentiment. SCOTT    'MELINDA AND MELINDA' Directed by Woody Allen. Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Will Ferrell, Jonny Lee Miller, Radha Mitchell, Amanda Peet, Chloe Sevigny and Wallace Shawn (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though the drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, Mr. Allen interweaves them deftly enough and provides some of the members of his large cast with opportunities to do some crisp, old-fashioned stage-style acting. The link between the two tales in Ms. Mitchell, who plays Melinda in both -- an unhappy woman who throws the romantic, professional and social lives of a group of articulate Manhattanites into mild turmoil. In the tragedy, she chain-smokes and fidgets, while in the comedy she has an ingenue's golden glow. Some of the actors fare better than others -- Ms. Sevigny and Mr. Ejiofor seem best suited for Mr. Allen's anti-naturalistic approach to acting, while Mr. Ferrell's shambling geniality make him a poor choice for the inevitable role of Woody Allen surrogate. In any case, the movie is most powerful as an extended piece of real estate pornography, depicting a seductive fantasy New York (though filmed in the real one) where struggling film makers and out-of-work actors live in fabulous lofts and labyrinthine prewar apartments. SCOTT    *'MILLIONS' Directed by Danny Boyle. Starring Alex Etel (PG, 97 minutes). When it comes to making movies, Mr. Boyle is usually up to no good, which is something this visual stylist does with great ostentatious flair. Best known for ''Trainspotting,'' a grungy entertainment about the gleefully down and out, and for the shiver-filled zombie flick ''28 Days Later,'' Mr. Boyle is the sort of creative type in whom the milk of human kindness often seems to curdle rather than flow. Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves his stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. Pegged to a motherless child named Damian (Alex Etel, making a sensational debut), ''Millions'' is about the secret world of children, in particular that miraculous, tragically brief interlude when the young imagination -- not yet captive to crippling adult conventions like time, space and rational thought -- takes boundless flight. DARGIS    'THE PACIFIER' Directed by Adam Shankman. Starring Vin Diesel (PG, 97 minutes). In the primary visual gag of ''The Pacifier,'' a Navy Seal, on a top-secret babysitting mission, retrofits his gun and grenade holders to keep baby formula and diapers at the ready. Despite the specter of boogeymen, Disney's new family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. As a special-ops warrior with a heart-thawing assignment, Mr. Diesel succeeds as a genre-switcher through the help of an able ensemble. The mayhem should delight kids, just as the imposed order will please parents. Anyone else, however, might feel as though they are, in Mr. Diesel's words, merely ''burning daylight.'' NED MARTEL    'THE RING TWO' Directed by Hideo Nakata. Starring Naomi Watts (PG-13, 111 minutes). It was only a matter of time before the Japanese horror auteur Hideo Nakata went Hollywood and so he has at last as the director of, yes, ''The Ring Two,'' the inevitable sequel to the American remake of his original hit. (Got that?) Once again, Ms. Watts plays Rachel Keller, a journalist and a single mom to a young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), recently relocated from Seattle to a small coastal town in Oregon. In ''The Ring,'' Rachel escaped the marauding ghost in the machine and now thinks she has entered a new chapter. No such luck; she is actually mucking about on a slag heap of recycled scares, dumb lines and predictable entanglements, including some static with a potential boyfriend replacement (Simon Baker) and some weirdness with an asylum inmate (Sissy Spacek in a fright wig). Once again, blood pools, water flows and the ghost comes calling through the magic of video, scaring to death anyone foolish enough not to have made the move to DVD. DARGIS    'ROBOTS' Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha. With the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and Robin Williams (PG, 89 minutes). Like so many other non-Pixar computer-animated family movies, this one, from Fox's Blue Sky Studios, runs on visual novelty and narrative familiarity. The setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination, as are the characters, an assortment of dented heroes and sleek, silvery villains. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions, cool soundtrack music and heartwarming lessons about being yourself and following your dreams. There is, it must be said, a certain honesty to the story, which suggests that recycled, second-hand junk is superior to the latest high-tech upgrades, a moral the movie at once upholds and refutes. SCOTT    *'SCHIZO' Directed by Guka Omarova. Starring Olzhas Nusuppaev (No rating, 86 minutes, in Russian, with English subtitles). This modest neo-realist film from Kazhakstan is both tough and tender, and it illuminates the lives of its characters with bracing clarity and understated empathy. Schizo is a teen-aged boy living with his mother and her boyfriend in a desolate area of vast fields and ababandoned industry. After helping his would-be stepfather recruit fighters for illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches, Schizo gets involved with Zinka, a local woman whose husband has died in the ring after a brutal bout. Their friendship is sweet and a little improbable, but as the movie follows the conventions of a crime-tinged coming-of-age story it achieves a rough, convincing poetry made of the hard circumstances of real life. SCOTT    'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' Directed by Mike Binder. Starring Joan Allen, Kevin Costner, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Mr. Costner and Ms. Allen to do some marvelous work. Both performances are somewhat familiar: Mr. Costner, once again, is an athlete past his prime, and Ms. Allen is a brittle, unhappy suburban housewife, but the actors slip into their characters with ease and wit, and complement each other beautifully as they explore a haphazard friendship that turns into a love affair. The downside is that Mr. Binder does not give them enough of a dramatic context to work in, and undermines their efforts with a surprise ending that very nearly destroys the whole movie. Ms. Witt, Ms. Christensen, Ms. Wood and Ms. Russell play Ms. Allen's daughters, but their characters are as thinly conceived as figures in a television pilot, and it is hard to believe that the four of them and Ms. Allen add up to a family. SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. *denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    A GUY CALLED GERALD, 69 West 14th Avenue, at Avenue of the Americas, www.enablernetwork.org. This British producer and D.J. helped propel Manchester acid-house scene in the late 1980's; thanks in part to him, the electronic sounds of Chicago and Detroit found more appreciative audiences overseas. Since then, Gerald has veered toward a more eclectic -- and, quite often, less powerful -- approach; his new album, ''To All Things What They Need'' (Studio K7), is a rather vague-sounding disc full of syncopated tracks that gesture toward soul music. Expect a good party, regardless. Tomorrow night after 10, with Carter Reece and Cowboy Mark; admission is $8 before midnight, $12 after. KELEFA SANNEH    BARDO POND, NO NECK BLUES BAND, Asterisk Art Project, 258 Johnson Avenue, near Bushwick Avenue, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com. A night of free rock featuring a pair of veteran acts. Bardo Pond, from Philadelphia, specializes in heavy, cyclical songs, letting big, dusty guitar riffs come round again and again. The local band No Neck Blues Band makes music that sounds (and sometimes is) accidental, letting homemade grooves rise up out of chaos or silence and then disappear again. Tonight at 8, with SubArachnoid Space and Psychic Ills; admission is $10. SANNEH    JUDY COLLINS, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, Upper West Side, (212)496-7070. With her clear voice and ear for picking songs, Judy Collins was a hitmaker in the 1960's and a catalyst for the careers of Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen, among others. She added her own songwriting to her repertory and has continued to delve into everything from Stephen Sondheim to Christmas songs. Tonight at 8; tickets are $43 and $53. JON PARELES    *CROOKED FINGERS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. As the leader of Archers of Loaf, Eric Bachmann wrote gnarled indie-rock songs. Lately, on the new Crooked Fingers album ''Dignity and Shame'' (Merge), he has turned to more straightforward songs in the territory of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, with weary but determined folk-rock that asks questions like ''Why won't you fall back in love with me.'' And he can still stir up the guitars. Tomorrow night at 8, with the Dears and Liz Durrett opening; tickets are $16. PARELES    *CRYPTOPSY, B.B. King Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. This Montreal-based extreme metal band specializes less in riffs than in atmospheres: the warp-speed drumrolls of Eric Langlois seem almost decorative when one of the group's fragmented songs goes roaring by. While some extreme metal bands pride themselves on sounding ruthless, Cryptopsy isn't nearly single-minded enough for that: the group's precise tantrums switch directions every few seconds. Sunday night at 8, with Skinless, Cattle Decapitation and the Autumn Offspring; tickets are $17 in advance, $20 at the door. SANNEH    MARIA DE BARROS, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212)243-4940. The best-known music from Cape Verde, the islands off Senegal, is a style called morna, the lilting and pensive songs carried worldwide by Cesaria Evora. Maria de Barros sings some mornas, but she also sings other Cape Verdean styles -- including bright, driving funanas -- to carry her thoughts on love, tradition and women's strength. Tonight at midnight and 2 a.m.; admission is $20. PARELES    DAVID DRIVER SINGS SCOTT WALKER, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. The songs Scott Walker wrote in the 1960's were strange, melodramatic rambles through innocence and despair, and David Driver is ready to lead their latest rediscovery. Mr. Driver's husky baritone is a good replica of Mr. Walker's youthful voice, and he'll be backed by the adept Loser's Lounge band. Tonight at 7; tickets are $15. PARELES    DROPKICK MURPHYS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800. Formed in Boston in 1996, Dropkick Murphys play gruff punk with some rowdy Irish roots and offer no mercy for posers or phonies. Their sing-along choruses are more like shout-alongs, and they have plenty of people to shout; the band's first two shows this weekend are sold out. Sunday night at 8, with the Casualties and Brain Failure opening; tickets are $22.50. PARELES    FLOETRY, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Cooing melodies meet socially conscious rapping in the English duo Floetry, which allies a rapper, Natalie Stewart, and a singer, Marsha Ambrosius. They boast, preach positive thinking and delve into love, articulating uncertainties along with lust. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 at the door. PARELES    *JENNIFER GENTLE, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. Jennifer Gentle is a crypto-retro-rock band from Italy that just released a confounding and charming album called, ''Valende'' (Sub Pop). Whispery acoustic ballads crashland on top of wriggly rants, and neopsychedelic soundscapes give way to playful, off-center pop songs. Here's hoping the band is even more confounding onstage. Tonight at 9:30, with Child Ballads and Dead Meadow; tickets are $12. SANNEH    *GOOD FRIDAY GOSPEL, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 32nd Street, (212)465-6741. Hezekiah Walker, Fred Hammond, Bebe Winans, Donnie McCluskin and many more are to converge upon this subterranean theater for an Easter Weekend concert -- expect lots of joy and even more noise. Tonight at 8; tickets are $34.50 to $54.50. SANNEH    GROOVE COLLECTIVE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Brooklyn's long-runnning acid-jazz band looks back to the smoothly percolating funk-jazz of the 1970's and adds touches of 1990's hip-hop, making easygoing party music for a broad coalition of listeners. Tomorrow night at midnight; tickets are $10. PARELES    ROBYN HITCHCOCK, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703. Tightly wound melodies and unsprung narratives meet in Robyn Hitchcock's songs, which bridge the psychedelia of Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett and the archtypal English ''nonsense'' of Edward Lear. Behind the whimsy is an acute observer of love, death and the entire evolutionary continuum from plants to bugs to humans. Onstage, Mr. Hitchcock free-associates stories that can be as improbably touching as his songs. His most recent album was produced by David Rawlings, the musical partner of Gillian Welch, and the stripped-down settings reveal the genuine yearning in songs about, among other things, a man's romance with his television set. Tomorrow night at 7, with Amy Miles opening; admission is $15. PARELES    PATTI LABELLE, North Fork Theater at Westbury, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, L.I. (516) 334-0800. Nothing exceeds like excess in the singing of Patti Labelle. She tears into her love songs with the over-the-top emotionality of a well-traveled soul diva, soaring toward the heavens or growling to get earthy. Melvin George shares the bill. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; tickets are $60. PARELES    *JOHNNY PACHECO, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, (212) 239-2672. The flutist and bandleader Johnny Pacheco celebrates his 70th birthday. He was born in the Dominican Republic, but fell in love early with Afro-Cuban music, and he has been a prime mover in New York Latin music since the 1960's, when he helped start Fania Records. He went on to lead the Fania All-Stars, the band that defined New York salsa. His guests include the singers Willie Colón, Adalberto Santiago, Ismael Miranda and Cita Rodriguez along with the cuatro (Puerto Rican guitar) master Yomo Toro and the timbales player Roberto Roena. Tomorrow night, doors open at 10; admission is $30, advance reservations are $35 with a two-drink minimum. PARELES    HENRY ROLLINS, Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)563-0480.Henry Rollins was a pioneering West Coast punk as the singer of Black Flag, and he explored more complex music with his own Henry Rollins Band. But he also tours, as in these shows, as a storyteller without a band, getting laughs and stunned silences as he talks about memories, odd situations and untimely deaths. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $35 in advance, $40 at the door. PARELES    MELVIN SPARKS BAND, Lucille's Grill, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Before it was called acid-jazz, the blues and funk-rooted jazz that the guitarist Melvin Sparks plays was called soul-jazz. Born in Texas in 1946, Mr. Sparks has recorded with the organist Jack McDuff, the saxophonist David (Fathead) Newman, Lonnie Liston Smith and Charles Earland; his current group is showing jam-band fans how steamy the old grooves can be. Sunday night at 8; free admission PARELES    *TETINE, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212) 243-4940. The harsh slums of Rio de Janeiro, called favelas, have generated their own party music at events called funk balls, or bailes funk, where deep Miami-style bass lines meet singsong tunes, samba rhythms, Jamaican dancehall cechoes, sampled gunshots and blunt, raunchy lyrics. It's a raw Brazilian take on electro, techno and hip-hop from people with, almost literally, nothing to lose. This show is probably the first Carioca funk event in New York City. Tomorrow night at 1 a.m.; admission is $10. PARELES    TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25. PARELES    STEVE VAI, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824. Steve Vai's hard-rock guitar instrumentals are all about speed and precision as he makes the scales whiz by and the high notes wail. Look for the guitar calluses on the hands of audience members. Eric Sardinas opens tomorrow night at 11:15; tickets are $27.50 and $37.50. An 8 p.m. show is sold out. PARELES    *ANDY VAZ, Café Deville, 103 Third Avenue, at 13th Street, (212) 477-4500. Andy Vaz, a rigorous minimalist, delights in letting his micro-compositions twist and mutate as they go -- his artful dance music seems designed both to focus and dissolve the mind. Tonight after 10, with Kevin McHugh; admission is free. SANNEH    WRECKLESS ERIC, the Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. In the late 1970's, the English label Stiff Records had a stable of eccentric, hard-nosed rockers that included Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe and an electric-guitar-strumming Wreckless Eric, whose memorable hit was ''The Whole Wide World.'' He's done some hard drinking and hard thinking in the intervening decades, and has the songs to show for it. Tomorrow night at 7; admission is $10. PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. *denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BETTY BUCKLEY, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)744-1600. The unifying thought behind the singer's new show, ''Smoke,'' is the evanescence of perfect moments, often romantic ones, that we can't hold onto try as we might. The signature number in this smart, carefully balanced program that embraces jazz, country, bossa nova, pop standards, soft rock and art songs is Mary Chapin Carpenter's pop-country ''When Time Stands Still.'' Ms. Buckley's pianist, Kenny Werner, makes a formidable musical contribution. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $70; no minimum. STEPHEN HOLDEN    *BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. HOLDEN    *'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30 with a $10 minimum at a table. HOLDEN    *TIERNEY SUTTON, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. Ms. Sutton is a pure jazz spirit who respects a song. Even when going out on an improvisatory limb, she never lets its essence slip away. The singer and her trio with whom she has worked for years -- Christian Jacob on piano, Kevin Axt on bass and Ray Brinker on drums -- have refined the kind of rapport that could only be achieved over time. Her deep, lingering renditions of chestnuts like ''Blue Skies'' and ''Without a Song'' are especially impressive for the sense of quiet joy she breathes into them. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30 p.m. Cover: $50, with a $20 minimum; a $50 prix fixe dinner is required at the early shows. HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. *denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    *JOHN ELLIS QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. John Ellis, an adept young saxophonist who has performed with Charlie Hunter, among others, replays some of his Southern background in his jazz. So his sets may include lullabies and folk songs on the order of ''John Brown's Gun,'' reorderings of bebop standards and original tunes of increasing complexity. (His new record, ''One Foot in the Swamp,'' released by Hyena, shows his growth.) He's playing with a super-smart, swinging band, including the guitarist the Mike Moreno, the pianist Robert Glasper, the bassist Roland Guerin and the drummer Jason Marsalis. Sets are tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set, $10 for members. BEN RATLIFF    *MARIA SCHNEIDER ORCHESTRA, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. Some feel that Ms. Schneider's big-band music has been revelatory from the word go, 15 years ago or so, but the music on ''Concert in the Garden'' -- her first album distributed by the Internet-based company Artist Share (at www.mariaschneider.com) -- reaches a new level of beauty and complexity. Apparently many others thought so, too; it won a Grammy this year, for best ensemble album, and was nominated for three others. The orchestra, which has remained remarkably intact over that decade and a half, plays a three-day residence at the Jazz Standard. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 and $25 on Sunday. RATLIFF    GUNTER HAMPEL TRIO, Vision Club, Clemente Soto Velez Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, www.visionfestival.org. A vibraphonist, woodwind player and composer, Mr. Hampel has been on the jazz scene since the late 1950's, starting as a European journeyman mainstream player and then becoming a bright light of the avant-garde in the 1960's, documenting his activities on his own label, Birth records. He'll be playing new music with the clarinetist Perry Robinson and the drummer Lou Grassi. Tomorrow night at 9:30 pm; tickets are $10. RATLIFF    TOM HARRELL QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. Mr. Harrell, a fluegelhornist, can be an acquired taste: he's soft and lyrical, but also severely logical and self-editing. At his best, he's a consummate jazz improviser, and for musicians, he's at the top of the class. His bands are typically full of the better young players. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF    LOUIS HAYES AND THE CANNONBALL LEGACY BAND, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Louis Hayes, whose drumming you might know from the Blue Note hard-bop records of the mid-1960's, is a standard-bearer of this music as an almost classical entity; this weekend he plays the repertory of the saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, one of his old colleagues. Sets through Sunday are at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF    CLIFF KORMAN ENSEMBLE, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. An ambitious American pianist and arranger, Mr. Korman has spent much of the last two decades in Brazil, especially in collaborations with the great clarinetist Paolo Moura. Recently he composed a suite, ''Migrations,'' loosely based on a photographic book by Sebastião Salgado. The CD of the music has just been released on Planet Arts, and Mr. Korman will perform the music with a sextet. Sunday night at 8; admission is $12, $10 for members. RATLIFF    RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212)864-6662. Mr. Malone, a guitarist who enlivened the first popular version of Diana Krall's group, balances jaw-dropping agility with blues acumen. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $25. RATLIFF    EARL MAY QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253. The bassist for Barry Harris, among other eminent elder statesman in jazz, Mr. May swings in the old way; on hand to help him is the excellent drummer Eddie Locke, who used to play behind Coleman Hawkins, as well as the bassist Dave Glasser and the pianist Larry Ham. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8:30, 10 and 11:30 p.m.; cover charge is $20 and there is a one-drink minimum. RATLIFF    JOHN McNEIL'S INSOMNIA BAND, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212)989-9319. A composer of humor and intelligence, the trumpeter John McNeil has played a secondary role as a longtime sideman and educator. But he's stepping out more as a band leader, releasing albums on the Omnitone label and gigging regularly. This band includes the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry, the trombonist Curtis Hasselbring, the bassist Mike McGuirk and the drummer Ted Poor. Tonight at 9; cover charge is $10. RATLIFF    *JAMES MOODY 80th BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION, Blue Note, 131 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Mr. Moody is one of the stealth weapons of his generation in jazz. At this point you expect uncomplicated nostalgia, or at least a brave staying of the course, from a saxophonist who played on some of the most important bebop sessions of the 1940's. But his playing remains superb, and his career a wild affair: he's as comfortable cracking jokes and playing the showman as going head to head with imposing young players like Mark Turner, as he did in a memorable album a few years ago. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $30, with a $5 minimum. RATLIFF    *TED NASH AND ODEON, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)258-9595. Mr. Nash is a saxophonist and clarinetist with an almost classical sense of control, and his cool disposition sets the tone for his groups. Odeon features Clark Gayton on trombone, Natalie Bonin on violin, Bill Schimmel on accordion and Matt Wilson on drums. This is a group that blends the idiom of jazz and tango, with the composer's own individual quirks set into the mix; it has a graceful new album just out, ''La Espada de la Noches,'' on Palmetto. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables and $5 at the bar. RATLIFF    *LUIS PERDOMO TRIO, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. The Venezuelan-born pianist Luis Perdomo plays serious, analytical music, wrapped in complexities of rhythm, with curling unison lines for piano and saxophone set over percussion. His sound is related to the music of Steve Coleman, Danilo Perez, Vijay Iyer and Dave Holland: the apotheosis of the groove, and its development through Afro-Cuban rhythms and funk. It's energetically limber stuff, and proof that ''Latin jazz'' is an almost misleadingly clinical term; at this level, jazz and Latin music have dissolved into each other. The band includes Drew Gress on bass and Eric McPherson on drums. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set. RATLIFF    *SAXOPHONE SUMMIT: JOE LOVANO, MICHAEL BRECKER, DAVE LIEBMAN, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. All wide-ranging players who have made a big impact on the way jazz saxophone has been played since John Coltrane, Mr. Lovano, Mr. Brecker and Mr. Liebman convene every once in a while on the same stage; they're an impressive crew. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40 and there is a $10 minimum at the tables. RATLIFF    *SF JAZZ COLLECTIVE, Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street at Broadway, (212)721-6500. An octet of jazz musicians all worthwhile in their own right, and it's the house band of SFJazz, the arts-producing organization that often seems like the West Coast version of Jazz at Lincoln Center. The band includes the saxophonists Joshua Redman and Miguel Zenon, the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, the pianist Renee Rosnes, the trombonist Isaac Smith, the bassist Matt Penman and the drummer Eric Harland; they are touring with a program of originals by the various group members, commissioned by SFJazz, and also of re-worked Coltrane pieces, arranged by Gil Goldstein, the band's de facto (off-stage) ninth member. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; remaining tickets are $70 to $150. RATLIFF    TIM BERNE'S HARD CELL, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. A group with Tim Berne on saxophones, Craig Taborn on synthesizer and Tom Rainey on drums; they play chopped-off funk lines, gathering momentum into what are very nearly grooves, and extend them into long, highly improvised joyrides. Tonight at 10 pm; cover charge is $10. RATLIFF    *TRIBUTE TO JIMMY SMITH, WITH JOEY DEFRANCESCO TRIO, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212)582-2121. In the 1950's, Jimmy Smith developed a pathbreaking style on the Hammond organ: he used Charlie Parker as an improvisatory model and made it sound percussive. He influenced lots of players on the instrument, and Joey DeFrancesco is one of the younger beneficiaries of Mr. Smith's greatness; before Mr. Smith died last month, the two organists made an album together, ''Legacy,'' on Concord. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. *denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'CARMEN' City Opera offers a straightforward production of Bizet's familiar story about the gypsy and the soldier; it's left to the singers to offer insight. The cast for this season's revival includes two singers new to the company. John Bellemer, the Don José, has been singing in France and Germany, as well as American regional companies, and will returns this summer to the Opera Theater of St. Louis; Malcolm MacKenzie, the Escamillo, hails from California and is a veteran of the regional circuit. Most eyes and ears will of course focus on Carmen: Katharine Goeldner, a mezzo who has won praise in previous outings at City Opera. Gary Thor Wedow conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115. ANNE MIDGETTE    'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' The Metropolitan Opera's run of the ''Cavalleria Rusticana''/''Pagliacci'' double bill winds down its season run with tomorrow's matinee. Santuzza and Turiddu in Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' are Violeta Urmana and Eduardo Villa. Nedda in Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci'' is Patricia Racette, with John Mac Master and Juan Pons as Canio and Tonio. Dennis Russell Davies conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $75 to $315 . BERNARD HOLLAND    'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' The essentials of Puccini's opera are well-served in Mark Lamos's spare, attractive production, in which a magnified and uncluttered version of a traditional Japanese house fills the stage. The cast includes Gerard Powers as Pinkerton, Lori Phillips as Butterfly, John Packard as Sharpless and Jennifer Dawn Hines as Suzuki. Steven Mosteller conducts, and has the orchestra sounding quite good, if perhaps a bit too loud for the singers. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30. New York State Theater. (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105 tonight; $32 to $115 on Sunday. ALLAN KOZINN    *'ORLANDO' No Handel opera is musically richer and more psychologically resonant than ''Orlando.'' The story, adapted from Ariosto, tells of a renowned knight who, tired of pursuing glory though combat, turns his attention to love. But a magician, Zoroastro, intent on steering Orlando back to the path of valor, entices him into a forest where romantic entanglements drive him temporarily mad. The New York City Opera's imaginative new production by the director Chas Rader-Shieber is set in a wondrous storybook forest with marbled doorways serving as enchanted portals to the courtly world the forest travelers have left behind. The cast is first rate, with the exciting countertenor Bejun Mehta in the title role. The robust bass-baritone David Pittsinger sings Zoroastro. Antony Walker conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115. ANTHONYTOMMASINI    'DER ROSENKAVALIER' Strauss's much admired opera has returned to the Met with some familiar and fresh faces in the cast. Susan Graham is in fine form for her signature role as Octavian, and Laura Aikin sings Sophie with a pure and silken tone. The beguiling newcomer here is the German soprano Angela Denoke, who brings an affecting sense of vulnerability to the world-weary Marschallin. Her performance is subtle, with high notes and a certain wistfulness wafting gently into the house. In the pit, Donald Runnicles stirs up the Met Orchestra, as if to remind us that ''Rosenkavalier'' has its modern edges, too, but he is also not afraid to bask in the more nostalgic moments of this beautiful score. The Met is still getting mileage off of Nathaniel Merrill's popular production, over three decades old and counting. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $315. JEREMYEICHLER    'TOSCA' The young Italian tenor Salvatore Licitra made a last-minute debut at the Metropolitan Opera in May of 2002, substituting for Luciano Pavarotti in Puccini's ''Tosca'' on what was assumed (incorrectly, it turned out) would be Mr. Pavarotti's farewell to the Met. On that night, Mr. Licitra, who was 33 at the time, seemed an immensely gifted tenor with an exciting but raw and unfinished voice. He is back at the Met for the first time since his dramatic debut, again as Cavaradossi in ''Tosca.'' Unfortunately, as an artist and singer he remains a work in progress. He still boasts a dusky-toned and powerful voice and sings with youthful energy and fervor. But he was vocally cautious on the first night of the Met's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's 1985 production and his phrasing was sometimes labored. His Tosca, the veteran soprano Maria Guleghina, as is her way, sacrifices beauty of sound and lyrical elegance for the sake of hard-edged power and dramatic intensity. The excellent baritone Mark Delavan makes a vocally robust and dramatically imposing Scarpia. James Conlon conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $200 to $315; returns, if available, are sold before the performance. TOMMASINI    Classical Music    AMERICAN FESTIVAL OF MICROTONAL MUSIC The principle that drives microtonality is that the Western scale need not be divided into only 12 notes -- it can just as usefully be divided into 20, 50, or any number a composer decides upon, so long as instruments can be made on which the pitches can be played, and as long as musicians are willing to learn them. There has long been a sufficiently large group of microtonal composers and performers in New York -- and listeners interested in what they are up to -- for the bassoonist and composer Johnny Reinhard to run an annual festival of the music. This year's Microfest includes three programs, the first of which includes some standard repertory (works by Telemann, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Schumann) played on instruments in non-standard tunings, as well as new works by Mordecai Sandberg and Mr. Reinhard. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Faust and Harrison Pianos, 205 West 58th Street. (212) 517-3550. Tickets: $15, $10 for students and 65+. KOZINN    BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC Ute Lemper has never sung at the Brooklyn Academy of Music; but this weekend, the unrelentingly striking German chanteuse will change that state of affairs by appearing in Kurt Weill's ''Seven Deadly Sins'' with the all-male a capella ensemble Hudson Shad. Since one appearance cannot be enough for Ms. Lemper, she will also perform a selection of French chansons. The accompanist -- and presenter -- is the Brooklyn Philharmonic, which is offering Hindemith's ''Kammermusik No. 1'' and Ravel's ''Tombeau de Couperin'' by way of contextualization of Ms. Lemper's offerings. Carl St. Clair, the conductor, will make his debut with the orchestra. Tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $60. MIDGETTE    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Kent Nagano is visiting the New York Philharmonic this week, conducting a program of Bach and Messiaen. Excerpts from Bach's ''Art of Fugue'' arranged for orchestra is simply one more way to approach a work that is more a summation of Bach's thoughts on counterpoint than music for public performance. It may be as good a way to go as any. Sheryl Staples and Sherry Sylar will be the soloists in Bach's Violin and Oboe Concerto. After intermission, the young and very busy American conducts Messiaen's ''Éclairs sur l'Au-Delà.'' This afternoon at 2, tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $22 to $74 today, $25 to $90 tomorrow night. HOLLAND    GARRICK OHLSSON This formidable pianist is, among other things, a veteran Beethovian, and this weekend he marshals his considerable expertise for an all-Beethoven recital featuring the Sonatas Nos. 4, 5, 21 and 27. The performance is presented by Peoples' Symphony Concerts, which means the ticket prices are amazingly low. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, 40 Irving Place, (212)586-4680. Tickets: $9, on sale in the high school lobby tomorrow at 6 p.m. EICHLER    POMERIUM This most venerable of New York's early-music vocal ensembles, founded in 1972 and led by Alexander Blachly, consistently presents programs that offer both beautiful singing and scholarly enlightenment. Its program at the Cloisters tomorrow is appropriately seasonal and includes chant for Easter, elaborations on chant melodies by Dufay and other composers and motets by Lassus, Monteverdi, Gesualdo and Byrd. Tomorrow at 1 and 3. The Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, (212) 650-2290. Tickets: $35.

Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    *JEROME BEL A French choreographer known for playful and sometimes irreverent productions offers the New York premiere of ''The Show Must Go On,'' a 90-minute piece that has been danced around the world. Its cast includes Mr. Bel's sisters and friends. Much of the work is antic, but there are also quiet moments of nostalgia to make audiences sigh as well as smile. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212), 924-0077. Tickets: $20. JACK ANDERSON    'I LOVE TANGO' This is the last weekend to see this ''tango musical,'' which boasts four dancers and live string, bandoneon, piano and vocal music. Tonight and tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718)729-3880. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+. JENNIFER DUNNING    JETTE PERFORMANCE COMPANY This jazz performance company fuses classical jazz, musical theater, and commercial jazz-funk in dances by the company director Jay T. Jenkins, whose credits include the choreography for music videos and tours by rock artists like Prince and Cyndi Lauper. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $20; $25, tonight, with reception. DUNNING    *'UR POCALYPSE!' More sad news from the arts scene in Williamsburg. Karinne Keithley and Chris Yon are closing Ur, a ''neighborhood dance palace,'' as they put it, that doubled as a lively storefront studio and theater. But they're going out with a bang, in a program of dances by Mr. Yon created in collaboration with Ms. Keithley, Taryn Griggs, Andrew Dinwiddie and Sara Smith, set to new music by Justin Jones, Ms. Keithley and Chris Lauterbach. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Ur, 445 Grand Street, Brooklyn, (347) 546-5079. Suggested donation: $10. DUNNING    WORK AND SHOW FESTIVAL The TriBeCa Performing Arts Center showcases the dances created by its resident dance, theater and music artists for the year in this series. The dance component includes choreography by Kraig Patterson and Christina Suarez (tonight); Ellis Wood and Richard Rivera (tomorrow) and a marathon program of work by all the residents (next Sunday). Tonight and tomorrow at 7 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, (212)220-1460. Tickets: $10 (dance and marathon events); $8 for students and 65+.

Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression, the emotions that reveal themselves after her best pictures leave their first impression, which is often alarm. She captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and -- this probably applies as much to Arbus as to any other photographer of the second half of the last century -- she captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some maddeningly dark, dense and absurdly theatrical galleries, like chapels, of memorabilia. That said, it touches her favorite subjects with grace. Even the shocking photographs of retarded women are sympathetic, implying that the world is full of wondrous things, if our eyes are open enough to recognize them, and that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $7 and 65+, $10. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    'BASQUIAT,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)683-5000, through June 5. In the 1980's, the hypertalented Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame, usually on the same surface. His loquacious, ugly-elegant ''letters to the world'' (Emily Dickinson's phrase) were in step with the 80's interest in collage and in redirecting the avant-garde strategies of Post-Minimalism into painting. But Basquiat also had an urgent subject: blackness, whose glories, histories and pain his art elucidates with extraordinary complexity, in volatile mixtures of ideas, emotions, colors and images that expand the viewer's experience of time and space. This generous retrospective has a few glitches -- too many works borrowed from too few collections and a slightly too empty look in some galleries -- but nothing really detracts from its power. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4. ROBERTA SMITH    *THOMAS DEMAND, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400, through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, so as to take his own cinematic photographs. He is really a sculptor, making models of places to produce pictures that have the presence of paintings. His subject is more than just photography's inherent unreliability, its slipperiness as truth. It also entails memory. He has reconstructed, from photographs, the blown-up room where plotters failed to kill Hitler, and the studio of an artist whom Baader-Meinhof terrorists assaulted during the 1970's in order to blow up the house of a prosecutor who lived next door. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students; children 16 and under and accompanied by an adult, free. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. KIMMELMAN    'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084, through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing jumbo survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, stress on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. ''Greater New York'' gladly services this giddy scene -- with its abundant gifts but, on the whole, its short-lived prospects. The show is a mirror of the current power structure, in which earnest and cunning students, not even yet graduated, are emerging already branded with signature styles. There's something rather depressing about such youthful professionalism, even while it is undeniably impressive.There are various trendlets: Henry Darger meets the Little Prince. Dystopian nature. Gaudy America. On the whole, the show, like the burbling young art world, seems almost too able to please. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+. KIMMELMAN    *TIM HAWKINSON, Whitney Museum of American Art, Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212)570-3676, through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Tim Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. Each requires some head-scratching decipherment, inviting admiration for its doggedness, while not straining too hard to earn a viewer's love. Feats of physical fancy, when so dizzily executed, can be their own justification. Mr. Hawkinson's larger purpose, you might say, is simply wonderment. At the same time the art borrows a healthy strain of ludicrous wit from Samuel Beckett, who knew a thing or two about how to clown around smartly. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Friday 1 to 9 p.m.; closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50; children 12 and under, free. KIMMELMAN    'RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE FITZWILLIAM MUSEUM, CAMBRIDGE,' the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700, through April 24. The third show recently mounted by the Frick devoted to small bronze sculptures, this one continues to enhance the notion that mini-bronzes can be as rewarding to the viewer as large-scale sculpture. The Fitzwilliam's elevation to world-class status in its holdings was helped materially by the donation, in 1995, of the superb collection built by Lt. Col. Mildmay Thomas Boscawen, an Englishman who ran sisal plantations in Africa. One of his prizes, shown here, is the finely wrought figure of an athlete doing a handstand, by the 16th-century French sculptor Barthelemy Prieur. Another splendid work given by a different donor is a pair of figure groups dating from 1717 by Massimiliano Soldani Benzi that derive from the classical myths of Jupiter's loves: ''Leda and the Swan With Cupid,'' and ''Ganymede and the Eagle With Cupid and a Dog.'' Though small, they have the charge of life-size works. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $5; and 65+, $8. GRACE GLUECK    *'PETER PAUL RUBENS (1577-1640): THE DRAWINGS,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through April 3. The show is sublime. It makes not the slightest difference that it has no grand thesis, provides no narrative arc, offers up a few newly discovered drawings and fresh, solid scholarship but no radical twist on the artist. If there is any artistic justice, the exhibition ought to inspire the sort of mobbish devotion that the Met show of Leonardo's drawings did two years ago. Reviewing the work seems a bit silly. What is there to say, except that the drawings illustrate the limits of what is humanly possible with a piece of chalk and a pen and paper? It is profoundly heartening. Rubens loved to draw and loved that he could draw like a god, and his joy is ours, in looking at what he drew. This includes a few drawings by other artists with which Rubens fussed, sticking in angels here, touching up a beard there. Rubens regarded drawings, other people's and his own, as organic, to be learned from and endlessly improved upon, like life. Hours and admission: See above. KIMMELMAN    Galleries: Uptown    NINA MUSHINSKY, Janos Gat, 1100 Madison Avenue, between 82nd and 83rd Streets, (212)327-0441, through April 2. Ms. Mushinsky is a New York-based painter who makes labor-intensive, all black-and-white pictures based on photographs she has taken in Central Europe. Her paintings of subjects like an antique dress in a history museum, a bleak highway ramp or blurry laughing people in a leafy backyard can take as long as two years to complete. They have a smudgy, dreamlike hyperreality. KEN JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    JOSÉ DAMASCENO: 'BEYOND CIRCUMSTANCE,' the Project, 37 West 57th Street, (212)688-4673, through April 2. To describe too fully the single work in this Rio de Janeiro-based conceptualist's exhibition would rob viewers of its mild surprise factor. Suffice it to say that it squeezes surrealistic proliferation into an otherwise ordinary situation; that it toys adroitly with the architecture of the gallery; and that its strictly black-and-white palette is très chic. JOHNSON    LAWRENCE WEINER: 'EN ROUTE,' Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through April 2. A founding guru of Conceptual Art, Mr. Weiner was one of the first American artists to ditch the fusty view of art as material object. He stopped painting in 1968 and took to a notebook, where he ''dematerialized'' the visual by making an object of language itself, trying thus to dispense with expensive materials and the status-y collector competition that has driven art prices into the stratosphere. In this show, he is up to his usual tricks: making cryptic statements in diagrammatic wall texts and schematic drawings. His graphic ingenuity is coupled with words that sometimes add up to concrete poetry; one could think of him as a quirky poet-designer with a moral imperative. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is a there there, but parsing it will get you nowhere. GLUECK    Galleries: Chelsea    MARK COHEN: 'GRIM STREET,' Bruce Silverstein, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 627-3930, through April 2. Mr. Cohen's famous photographs of a girl blowing a gum bubble so big it eclipses her face, of the extraordinarily gangly girl with the ball and bat and of the impish boy smoking a cigarette while his laughing friends look on are included here along with a selection of other oblique, mysterious, funny and sad pictures of children at play, people in cars, animals, street scenes and other subjects from ordinary life shot in the 70's in black and white and color. JOHNSON    STUART ELSTER, Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159, through April 16. The subject of Mr. Elster's sleek paintings is the ordinary American copper penny. Computer-scanned and digitally manipulated, it becomes the inspiration for spacey, glowing and pulsating fields of mottled coppery or silvery paint in which the bust of Abraham Lincoln and other distorted and fragmentary features of the coin have a ghostly presence. JOHNSON    LARRY ZOX: 'FIVE DECADES,' Stephen Haller Gallery, 542 West 26th Street, (212)741-7777, through April 5. Larry Zox's distinctive, color-drenched hard-edge canvases that made a splash in the Color Field movement of the 1960's form the bulk of this mini-retrospective, which covers his work from the late 50's to now. The signature 60's work, revealing his association with the group that included Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland, was based on a tricky geometrical scheme involving the interplay of diamonds and diagonals, which he worked with many variations and impressive results. His technique has since become much freer, and in his most recent, more emotive work, color seems more important than structure. It's been a long stretch between New York shows for Mr. Zox, and his return is welcome. GLUECK  Other Galleries    JEFF DAVIS: 'MY DEEP DARK PAIN IS LOVE,' KS Art, 73 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-9918, through April 16. Mr. Davis's nutty, finely made, neo-hippie colored pencil drawings and watercolors feature little bearded, long-haired, naked men who are equal parts Jesus and Charles Manson in all sorts of mysteriously ceremonial and often orgiastic configurations. The artist also presents a selection of comically monstrous wax candles cast from modified Halloween masks. JOHNSON    Last Chance    'JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT: IN WORDS ONLY,' Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, closing tomorrow. This excellent show concentrates on the cornerstones of Basquiat's art: language and a blocky, concise handwriting that amounts to a personal, almost digital typeface. The only images here are words, names, lists and phrases, often appropriated from odd places, like the index of a book on jazz or the title of a painting by Ter Borch. One nine-sheet work is simply a rewriting of the prolonged table of contents of ''Moby-Dick,'' suggesting a kind of poem. SMITH    'BODY PROXY: AN EXHIBITION BY NORMA JEANE,' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, closing tomorrow. Norma Jeane is the fictive persona in whose name a group of anonymous people produce works of conceptual art. This show includes a motorcycle that starts up and roars increasingly louder as you approach; a 100-kilometer-long strand of hair on a spool made by knotting together hairs from one person's head; and a round, flesh-colored sofa said to be saturated with sexually provocative pheromones that will get into your clothes if you sit on it. JOHNSON    IMRE KINSZKI, Klotz/Sirmon, 511 West 25th Street, (212)741-4764, closing tomorrow. Born in Budapest in 1901, Kinszki was a well-connected Modernist photographer whose works could stand up with pictures by more famous Hungarian peers like André Kertesz, Brassai and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. The tiny, velvety contact prints from the 20's and 30's in this show are formally exquisite and often emotionally poignant. They include a monumental close-up of chess pieces; studies of buildings and shadows; and a lovely picture of a sleeping baby. Kinszki never left Hungary, and he died in a concentration camp in 1945. JOHNSON    'STRANGER TOWN,' Dinter Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)947-2818, closing tomorrow. There's not much doubt that the definition of art is a lot more porous than it used to be, but the wind really blows through the cracks in this exhibition of drawings, paintings, videos, books, comic books, installations and T-shirts organized by the young artist Taylor McKimens. The talent hails from adjacent spheres like commercial illustration, graphic animation, Japanese manga and skateboarding. Standouts include the polymath drawings of Tomoo Gokita and the animated videos of Saiman Chow. And when the work isn't top-notch, it usually leads to something that is the music of the indie genius Daniel Johnston, for example.
