Austin Pendleton stars (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)    'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way'' a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Indifferently directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap operatic contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)    'ASCENSION' Brandon Ruckdashel makes a stunning debut in Edmund De Santis's clever comic mystery about a priest, a beautiful young man and a mother's accusation of sexual abuse (1:30). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates)    'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring André De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'SHAY DUFFIN AS BRENDAN BEHAN: CONFESSIONS OF AN IRISH REBEL' Mr. Duffin's uneven, often charming one-man show offers Behan's thoughts on drinking, great men, drinking, politics and drinking (1:15). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'THE VOYAGE OF THE CARCASS' The playwright Dan O'Brien succeeds admirably at evoking an atmosphere of tedium and claustrophobia. His play-within-a-play -- a vehicle for Dan Fogler -- is about a failed expedition of Arctic explorers frozen up together for seven years, who turn out to be a trio of sophomoric actors bickering in embarrassing dialogue about their lives, their relationships and their gas pains as they work together on a play about a failed expedition of Arctic explorers frozen up together for seven years. If this seems repetitive, it gives only a hint of the tedium in store for audiences (2:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515. (Anne Midgette)    Off Off Broadway    'THE CARTELLS' Douglas Carter Beane is giving some of his actor friends something constructive to do on Monday nights with this ridiculous staged soap opera about a dysfunctional oil family. Each week brings a different episode, rehearsal time is minimal, and the actors -- Brian d'Arcy James, Joanna Gleason and Elizabeth Berkley among them -- are having a great time (50 minutes). Comix, 353 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 524-2500. (Genzlinger)    'KRANKENHAUS BLUES' Sam Forman's bizarre tale of an actress, a playwright and a clown in a Nazi camp goes off the deep end fast, but there's a great monologue about cheese (1:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'TRUTH $(the heart is a million little pieces above all things$)'  The virtuoso storyteller Mike Daisey's new monologue, which addresses issues about lying, memoir and the James Frey scandal, is less funny than his previous work but just as engaging and intellectually curious (1:40). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line,'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    'BLUE DOOR' An African-American math professor struggles to reconnect to his cultural past in this small but densely packed new play by Tanya Barfield. Reg E. Cathey is the professor, abandoned by his wife and visited by the ghosts of his ancestors, all played by the vibrant young actor Andre Holland (1:35). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'HEART OF MY MYSTERY: THE HAMLET PROJECT' What could be a way to learn more about Shakespeare's longest play -- to interrupt an abridged version periodically with commentary from nearly 30 sources -- doesn't come off well on a stage. Still, because of their dramatic power, several scenes of this Wordplay production work in spite of the kibitzers (1:45). The Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, sixth floor, Clinton; (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    'HELL HOUSE' Les Freres Corbusier recreate evangelical Christian entertainments in this typically deadpan show (45 minutes). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closes on Sunday. (Gates)    'ME, MY GUITAR AND DON HENLEY' Krista Vernoff's saucy, satisfying black comedy is about six very different women in one dying man's complicated family tree (1:40). the 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tonight. (Gates)    'NICKEL AND DIMED' Joan Holden's play, based on Barbara Ehrenreich's book about the no-win jobs of the working poor, veers into cliché and propaganda. The 3Graces Theater Company production isn't helped by the somewhat confused direction, though several performers who portray service workers are quite winning (1:40). The Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, between Washington and West Streets, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Stevens)    * 'NIXON'S NIXON' Russell Lees's savory political satire takes place on the night before the president announced his resignation. Gerry Bamman and Steve Mellor created the roles of Nixon and Kissinger, respectively, in the original production from 1995, also directed by Jim Simpson, and they return to them with the ease of veteran vaudevillians slipping back into a comfortable partnership (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood)    'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    'TALE OF 2CITIES' Heather Woodbury's five-hour play about the ripple effect of the Dodgers' leaving Brooklyn is a timely and well-acted epic (6:00). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned punch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'être is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday.

'ALEX RIDER: OPERATION STORMBREAKER' (PG, 93 minutes) Based on the first in a series of best-selling kid lit adventure novels, the movie debut of Alex Rider, teenage super spy, is a James Bond flick for kids who have never heard of James Bond. (Nathan Lee)    'THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI' (No rating, 76 minutes) David Lee Fisher has used cinematic magic to superimpose living, speaking actors onto the original sets of the silent-film classic. It's discombobulating, but interesting. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Manohla Dargis)    'DRIVING LESSONS' (PG-13, 98 minutes) ''Driving Lessons'' belongs to that hardy niche of British comedies designed as star vehicles for distinguished actresses (preferably dames) of a certain age whose assignment is to win awards by devouring the scenery. If Julie Walters isn't yet a dame, her hammy portrayal of a retired actress who hires as her assistant a shy 17-year-old boy (Rupert Grint) from a strict Christian background is a step in that direction. (Stephen Holden)    'EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH' (PG, 103 minutes) A minimum-wage comedy chronicling the romance between a slacker box boy (Dane Cook) and a bodacious cashier (Jessica Simpson) working at a Costco-like megastore. Directed by Greg Coolidge with the creative flair of an entry-level training video, the movie is more tired than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (A. O. Scott)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    'FLICKA' (PG, 110 minutes) A ridiculous redo of Mary O'Hara's 1941 children's novel that confirms that nothing should ever come between a girl and her horse, especially a saddle. (Dargis)    'THE GRUDGE 2' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Puberty sets off an exponential increase in evil -- and incoherence -- in Takashi Shimizu's continuing saga about a Japanese wraith with a fondness for neck-snapping and Goth makeup. What's new is an Altmanesque cast of victims, vaporized according to stupidity and/or sluttiness. What's old are the defective light bulbs, scummy bath water and camerawork that makes even teenage flesh look mottled. What's sad is that ''The Grudge 3'' is already in the works. (Catsoulis)    * 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)    'INFAMOUS' (R, 118 minutes) Truman Capote -- again! -- on the trail of ''In Cold Blood.'' It is warmer and more stylish than last year's ''Capote'' -- with fine performances by Toby Jones as Truman and Sandra Bullock as his pal Harper Lee -- but also thinner. (Scott)    'JAAN-E-MANN' (No rating, 165 minutes, in Hindi) This good-natured Bollywood musical is a romantic triangle set in New York. Personable stars partly make up for the excesses of the genre. (Anita Gates)    * 'JONESTOWN: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PEOPLES' TEMPLE' (No rating, 85 minutes) The scariest aspect of this powerful, meticulously chronicled history of Jim Jones and his flock, who committed mass suicide in Guyana on Nov. 18, 1978, is that so many of the followers of this demented demagogue appear to have been intelligent, idealistic, life-loving people. Watch this documentary and shudder. (Holden)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    'MAN OF THE YEAR' (PG-13, 115 minutes) Robin Williams plays a comedian and talk show host who plunges into the presidential campaign, telling truths the timid politicians dare not utter. Not really. This would-be satire, written and directed by Barry Levinson, is hectic and tired, with too many plots and too few sharp insights. (Scott)    * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)    'THE MARINE' (PG-13, 93 minutes) Discharged from the Marine corps, John Triton returns home to find obnoxious yuppies, psychotic diamond thieves, a kidnapped wife and exploding gas stations. (Lee)    * 'THE PRESTIGE' (PG-13, 128 minutes) Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's new film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman) practicing their art in late-Victorian London. Scarlett Johansson is the lovely assistant. (Scott)    * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)    * 'REQUIEM' (No rating, 89 minutes, in German) Loosely based on the real-life story of a West German woman who died in 1976 after a series of failed exorcism attempts, ''Requiem'' traces the mental decline of a devout college freshman (a devastating Sandra Hüller) suffering from seizures and hallucinations. Directed in an intimate, naturalistic style by Hans-Christian Schmid, ''Requiem'' is a moving study of a tortured girl more at peace with medieval ritual than with modern medicine. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'RUNNING WITH SCISSORS' (R, 116 minutes) From Augusten Burroughs's best-selling memoir, this movie is a showcase of high-quality acting (especially from Annette Bening) without much in the way of dramatic coherence or emotional power. (Scott)    * 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)    'SLEEPING DOGS LIE' (R, 93 minutes) The uncomfortable message sent by Bobcat Goldthwait's lean, subversive comedy is how easy it is to gross out people who think they're so swinging and cool by confiding indiscretions from the past. The movie has the look and tone of a blunt, provocative sketch on the HBO series ''Lucky Louie.'' (Holden)    'SWEET LAND' (PG, 110 minutes) There's a tartness at the center of Ali Selim's sentimental tale of the prejudice faced by a German mail-order bride (Elizabeth Reaser) who arrives in 1920 Minnesota to marry a Norwegian farmer (Tim Guinee). The film's guileless, heartfelt style veers perilously close to corny at times, but the superb cast dares you to mock. Lovingly filmed in glorious 35-millimeter, the movie celebrates an old-fashioned love born of backbreaking work and shared difficulties, while the endless fields and magnificent skyline seem reason enough to endure. (Catsoulis)    'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash begs the question: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee)    'TIDELAND' (R, 120 minutes) Terry Gilliam, usually bold in his explorations of the boundary between fantasy and reality, here stumbles into a different frontier, the one that separates the merely bad from the utterly inexcusable. (Scott)    Film Series    'THE JAPANESE FILM: A TRIBUTE TO DONALD RICHIE' (Through tomorrow) The Museum of the Moving image honors Mr. Richie, the American-born screenwriter and film historian, with a two-weekend program of his selections and his own short films. This final weekend's features are Masaki Kobayashi's ''Samurai Rebellion'' (1967), a drama about a feudal kidnapping, and Hiroshi Teshigahara's ''Woman in the Dunes'' (1964), the story of an insect collector and a very strange woman. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    'KINO! 2006: NEW FILMS FROM GERMANY'  (Through Nov. 3) The Museum of Modern Art's 27th annual survey of contemporary German film began yesterday. This weekend's features include ''The Unknown Soldier'' (2006), Michael Verhoeven's documentary about a controversial photography exhibition, and Andreas Dresen's ''Summer in Berlin'' (2005), a comedy about a single mother, her roommate and the men in her life. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    'OTTO PREMINGER: NOTORIOUS' (Through Sunday) The Museum of Modern Art's nine-film retrospective of Preminger's work (he would have turned 100 this year) concludes Sunday. The closing-day feature is ''Exodus'' (1960), the story of the founding of the state of Israel, starring Paul Newman and Eva Marie Saint. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    'RESISTANCE AND REBIRTH: HUNGARIAN CINEMA, 50 YEARS AFTER '56'  (Through Nov. 15) On the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian revolution, the Film Society of Lincoln Center is screening more than two dozen films that reflect on that event. It begins today with Robert Vas's 1959 short ''Refuge England''; Mark Kidel's ''Hungary 1956: Our Revolution'' (2006), then Istvan Szabo's ''Apa'' (1966), a drama about a man searching for information about his dead father. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    SOROS/SUNDANCE DOCUMENTARY FUND: 'A 10th-ANNIVERSARY FILM SERIES' (Through Sunday) This program of 19 international documentaries that deal with human rights and social injustice is sponsored by the Open Society Institute and the Sundance Institute, with all screenings at Film Forum. The closing weekend's 15 films include Ra'anan Alexandrowicz's ''Inner Tour'' (2001), about Palestinians traveling throughout Israel, and Lindsay Fauntleroy's ''Still Standing'' (2006), about a survivor of Hurricane Katrina. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $5.50.

ALICE IN CHAINS (Wednesday and Thursday) In the late 1980's and early 90's, Alice in Chains helped create the Seattle grunge sound by slowing bluesy metal riffs into a lavalike sludge. Now, four years after the death of its singer, Layne Staley -- whose mastery of the nasal snarl remains unmatched -- the surviving members are touring with William Duvall in Mr. Staley's place. Hurt opens these shows. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario)    SUSANA BACA (Wednesday) Ms. Baca has made musicological studies of Afro-Peruvian songs, but she has also followed her clear, knowing voice in less purist directions, fusing the modal delicacy of her Peruvian band with musicians versed in jazz and rock. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $28 in advance, $32 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    BENEVENTO-RUSSO DUO (Tonight) The keyboardist Marco Benevento and the drummer Joe Russo have made a gradual rise on the jam-band circuit with kinetic meanderings that usually begin in peaceful soul-funk and end up in poundingly insistent climaxes that might as well be punk rock. With Tom Hamilton and American Babies. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $22. (Sisario)    JAY BENNETT, DEATH SHIPS (Monday and Tuesday) Mr. Bennett exited Wilco shortly before the release in 2002 of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,'' the big eureka moment when that band invented experimental alt-country. He's kept busy, going in the opposite direction: ''The Magnificent Defeat'' (Rykodisc), the newest of his four solo albums since leaving Wilco, has 13 clean, toe-tapping nuggets of countryish folk-rock. His backup band, Death Ships, also plays a set as the opening act. Monday at 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $15. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)    PETE BEST (Sunday) Yes, it's that Pete Best -- the drummer who was replaced by Ringo Starr in the Beatles. At 9 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500, rodeobar.com; no cover. (Pareles)    DR. JOHN (Tonight) Malcolm John Rebennack Jr., a k a Dr. John, is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and florid piano playing to jazz standards and songs with a conscience. At 8 and 10:30, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35. (Pareles)    FORRÓ IN THE DARK (Tomorrow) For about three years now, this group has been leading one of New York's best and lowest-tech dance parties at the East Village bar Nublu. The groove is a humble and sexy two-beat dance from northeastern Brazil called forró, made with accordion, hand-held percussion and, since this is New York, whiffs of distorted electric guitar. It travels well, and tomorrow the band comes to Tonic for a midnight show. 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $5. (Sisario)    * Dave Frishberg and Jessica MolaskeY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Frishberg, a great jazz songwriter and gruff interpreter of his own work, and Ms. Molaskey, a theatrical pop-jazz singer of tremendous range and depth, have teamed to deliver the year's smartest cabaret act. At 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $60 cover and $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden)    LISA GERMANO (Tonight) Ms. Germano, who emerged as John Mellencamp's fiddler in the 80's and has had an active solo career, writes ghostly waltzes and whispery ballads that probe intimate fears and memories. At 8 and 10, Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Pareles)    HAZMAT MODINE (Tomorrow) Scruffy old blues and swing become the vehicle in which this kitchen-sink New York band -- two harmonicas, guitars and a jungle gym of brass -- wanders the world in a kind of musical travelogue: now visiting Eastern European Gypsy sounds, now Jamaican rocksteady, now some Tuvan throat singing. Unlike a lot of high-concept globalists, Hazmat Modine makes it all work by maintaining a strong sense of home. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario)    * GEORGE JONES, KRIS KRISTOFFERSON (Tuesday) Frank Sinatra once called Mr. Jones ''the second-best white male singer,'' and among the many standards Mr. Kristofferson has written is the indelible ''Help Me Make It Through the Night.'' These titans of country music make extremely rare appearances at Carnegie Hall: Mr. Jones, who does not play New York very often at all, has not been there in 44 years, and it has been 36 years for Mr. Kristofferson. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $55 to $75. (Sisario)    AMJAD ALI KHAN (Tomorrow) One of India's great instrumentalists, Mr. Khan comes from a long line of virtuosos on the sarod (a fretless lute) -- in fact, he is a great-great-grandson of the man said to have invented it. With a delicate, weightless technique in even the most rapid-fire passages, he can make the sarod sound (to Western ears, anyway) almost bluesy. For his latest Carnegie Hall concert, Mr. Khan appears with his sons Amaan Ali Khan and Ayaan Ali Khan, also on sarod, and the tabla players Sukhvinder Singh and Samir Chatterjee. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $90. (Sisario)    ANGÉLIQUE KIDJO, YUNGCHEN LHAMO, SUSAN McKEOWN (Wednesday) There's not much to connect these three women besides their being pigeonholed in the catchall ''world music'' category, but with talents this strong -- and presented free, no less -- there is nothing to complain about here. Ms. Kidjo, a Benin-born New Yorker, brings a raw, powerful voice to sleek Afro-pop; Ms. Lhamo, long exiled from Tibet and an infrequent visitor here, sings tender and mournful prayers about struggle and forgiveness, set to soothing New Age sounds; Ms. McKeown, a regular in the New York Celtic scene, performs both traditional music and songs about the Irish immigrant experience in a confident, forthright voice. At 7 p.m., the Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com. (Sisario)    LADY SOVEREIGN (Sunday and Monday) Knowing that the odds might be against her a bit as a petite English woman trying to break into American hip-hop, Lady Sovereign -- born Louise Harman not quite 21 years ago -- embraces the fish-out-of-water role on her new album, ''Public Warning'' (Def Jam), rhyming about shepherd's pie cravings as well as her small bust and ''nonexistent bum.'' With the Epochs on Sunday, Kovas on Monday, and Young Love both nights. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)    JOHN LEGEND (Monday) This year he won three Grammy Awards, including best new artist, so John Legend has a right to be a little cocky. But on his follow-up album, ''Once Again'' (Sony), released this week, he still plays the gentleman -- for the most part, anyway. While graciously asking for his lady's affection on ''Save Room,'' the first single, channeling the most tasteful of 70's R&B, he permits himself the slightest racy double entendre, telling her that ''love hurts sometimes when you do it right.'' With Robin Thicke. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario)    Amanda McBroom (Tonight and tomorrow night) The singer-songwriter who is best known as the composer of ''The Rose'' is also a theatrical pop voice who conveys strong currents of empathy and humor. At 8, the Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $35 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden)    MANILAL NAG AND MITA NAG (Tomorrow) Manilal Nag, a master sitarist with a particular renown for rich, poignant improvisations, plays duets with his daughter and sitar disciple. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org or heartheworld.org; $32; $15 for students. (Sisario)    * MILTON NASCIMENTO (Tonight) A somewhat rare club appearance by Mr. Nascimento, one of Brazil's greatest songwriters as well as a singer of gentle and entrancing purity. His band includes Gastão Villeroy on bass, Wilson Lopes on guitar, Kiko Continentino at the piano and Lincoln Cheib on the drums. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $55 at tables, $35 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Sisario)    ROLLING STONES (Sunday and Tuesday) Nothing says ''forget about it'' like a Rolling Stones concert in a theater that seats about a tenth of their usual stadium audience. And if the tickets to these two shows at the Beacon Theater (capacity: 2,800), which are being filmed by Martin Scorsese, were not scarce enough already, the pool was further depleted when the Stones gave a block of tickets for Sunday's show to the Clinton Foundation, which is using them for fund-raising. (Presumably a lot of tickets here will be used for more private, and less accountable, forms of fund-raising -- caveat emptor.) At 8 p.m., 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; sold out. (Sisario)    SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Anyone who's heard a salsa band in New York City has probably seen some of the members of this group: they're the virtuosic journeymen who are one of New York's great musical resources. As the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, they reclaim salsa classics under the direction of the keyboardist Oscar Hernandez, who has worked with Ruben Blades and Paul Simon. At 8 and 10, with a dance lesson at 7, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $15. (Pareles)    ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. (Through Nov. 4.) At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Holden)    * TIGER LILLIES (Tuesday and Wednesday) Nothing inspires like horror and degeneracy. For Halloween, this ingenious Brecht-meets-Alice-Cooper cabaret-theater group from Britain, whose best known piece, ''Shockheaded Peter,'' was based on ''Struwwelpeter,'' the 19th-century collection of spectacularly gory bedtime stories, offers a new cycle partly based on the proto-sci-fi writings of H. P. Lovecraft. It might be a challenge -- Lovecraft's power to frighten comes through not in blood and guts but in ominous, mysterious suggestion -- though if anybody is up to it, it's the Tiger Lillies. At 8 p.m., St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org; $30. (Sisario)    DEREK TRUCKS BAND, SUSAN TEDESCHI BAND (Tomorrow) After years of juggling a family and two busy careers, these two guitarists, who happen to be married -- Mr. Trucks, who plays with the Allman Brothers, is one of the most graceful blues-rock players since Eric Clapton, and Ms. Tedeschi has had a strong if less remarkable career as a Bonnie Raitt-like woman-of-the-blues -- are finally on tour together. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35 and $45. (Sisario)    'ZAPPA PLAYS ZAPPA' (Tuesday) More than a decade after Frank Zappa's death, his transformation from rock composer to composer, period, seems about as complete as it can be. His vast output -- more than 60 albums -- is a repertory to be engaged and interpreted again and again, and for this tour, now on its second leg, his son, Dweezil, is playing his music with a roster that includes the former Zappa employees Steve Vai, Napoleon Murphy Brock and Terry Bozzio. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $42 and $90. (Sisario)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ERIC ALEXANDER (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Alexander, a tenor saxophonist with a yen for smart, surging hard bop, augments his working quartet -- the veteran pianist Harold Mabern, with the rhythm team of John Webber on bass and Joe Farnsworth on drums -- with a flexible frontline partner, the trumpeter-saxophonist-flutist Ira Sullivan.

J. Strickland. At 8:30 p.m., 10:30 p.m. and midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

''Lontano'' (ECM) is his third album, with a gifted younger rhythm section made up of the pianist Marcin Wasilewski, the bassist Slawomir Kurkiewicz and the drummer Michal Miskiewicz; it's a shimmering, gently abstract and warmly luminescent work, likely to sound even better in the flesh.

(Holland)    'The Elixir of Love' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American version of Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elisir'' is a delightful opera, and it's decently sung by Anna Skibinsky, an Adina with a little ribbon of a voice; John Tessier, an honest, solid, if North American Nemorino; and especially Jan Opalach, who has a lot of fun and sounds good as Dulcamara. George Manahan's conducting is not exactly Italianate. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Thursday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)    * 'IMPERMANENCE' (Wednesday and Thursday) The work of Meredith Monk, the pioneering composer-vocalist-choreographer, may be difficult to categorize, but it's always characterized by a kind of radiant honesty.

At 7:30 p.m., BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $50. (Midgette)    * 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tonight and Tuesday) In this visually beautiful production by the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella, the abstract staging deftly employs moveable screens, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-sized puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Franco Zeffirelli's crowd-pleasing production returns to the Met, this time starring the earthy and visceral soprano Andrea Gruber in the title role and the vocally and bodily muscular tenor José Cura as Cavaradossi.

(Holland)    LOS ANGELES MASTER CHORALE (Tomorrow) It's a pity that it's not Steve Reich's birthday more often.

At 7:30 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587, worksandprocess.org; sold out. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    American Folk Art Museum: 'A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.,' through Jan. 7. Few Early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Brewster was born deaf before remedial help or a common sign language existed. The case the show makes for Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    * Asia Society: 'Gilded Splendor: Treasures of China's Liao Empire (907-1125),' through Dec. 31. For a thousand years the Khitan, who established the Liao Empire, were dismissed by Chinese historians, but they have been redeemed by late-20th-century archaeological discoveries. The evidence is laid out in this show of more than 200 objects excavated from tombs, temples and walled cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. .Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Grace Glueck)    Brooklyn Museum: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE,1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Roberta Smith)    * Bronx Museum of the Arts, 'Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960's like a sunshower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. The Bronx Museum's absorbing, inevitably diffuse show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)    * Frick Collection: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING,' through Dec. 31. Weighing in at six works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Smith)    * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,'  through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck)    Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Americans in Paris: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in an exhibition that goes a little way toward reversing the fall season's trend of big, surveyish shows made up of splashy objects and bland ideas. In this case, the basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7719, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    * the MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck)    Museum of Modern Art: 'Eye on Europe: Prints, Books & Multiples, 1960 to Now,' through Jan. 1. This is a woolly, at times idiosyncratic assemblage of more than 350 prints and multiple editions by 118 European artists. Although they are still often considered secondary mediums, the show charts how prints and multiple editions rose to prominence in the 1960's as an essentially democratic strategy, having largely to do with accessibility and affordability, as artists explored alternatives to conventional painting and sculpture. Following this are displays of artwork by contemporary artists working in these mediums. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)    RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: Mark Grotjahn, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shieldlike frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)    The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Chelsea    * Karen Kilimnik Ms. Kilimnik's sharp, witty, low-key show is spun around a Napoleonic theme, with a full-scale battle tent sitting in the gallery and paintings of Géricaultian steeds and soldiers inside and out. But any incipient Romanticism is cut with impurities -- walk-ons from Hollywood, refugees from Allure magazine -- as if to keep everything off balance and confused. Although Ms. Kilimnik has a reputation as a celebrity fantasist, she's a conceptual artist with a cool, watchful, resistant eye. Everyone agrees that full recognition of her accomplishment and influence is long overdue. May it begin here. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, through Nov. 4. (Cotter)    KEN PRICE: SCULPTURE AND DRAWINGS, 1962-2006, through Nov. 4. The largest New York exhibition yet devoted to Mr. Price's polymorphous ceramic sculptures reviews four decades of progress, offers an array of powerful new small pieces and introduces his first attempt at something bigger. It invites us to contemplate his transubstantiation of Los Angeles finish fetish and the relationship of his jewel-like surfaces to the random vastness of Jackson Pollock's drip paintings. When will a New York museum give this amazing artist the retrospective he deserves? Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200. (Smith)    Last Chance    * Break Even This little firecracker of a show, organized by the artists Nicholas Guagnini and Gareth James, is a shrewd exercise in institutional critique. Highly conceptual and materially intense, it started with an advertisement in Artforum and incorporates original pieces by seven excellent artists to ask questions about the ties between art journalism, marketing, curatorial work and art-making. A result is an exhibition that is also an essay, that takes place in a gallery and in a magazine, that is a single work of art incorporating seven other works. And those other works are terrific. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    * Sheela Gowda This Indian-based artist began as a painter but has gone in many directions since, some of them evident in a show that includes drawings made with burning incense; a walk-in building made of flattened tar drums; a plumbing pipe sculpture that speaks; and a photo-based painting of a Bollywood pietà. The dual effects of harshness and lyricism, real life and fantasy, menace and tenderness, run through it all. Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, 11th floor, Chelsea, (212) 989-7074; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    Anish Kapoor: 'Sky Mirror' This immense, stainless steel dish by the British sculptor Anish Kapoor on view at Rockefeller Center is beautiful in design and is certainly one of the more successful artistic interventions in this narrow fissure of a space, a popular city stage for public art. The circular mirror weighs 23 tons, is 35 feet in diameter and tilts over on a 45-degree angle. Its concave side, angled upward, captures an inversion of the uppermost levels of the Rockefeller Center skyline; the other side, facing Fifth Avenue, reflects the busy street and adds a mood of wonder. (Genocchio)    Matthew Ritchie: 'The Universal Adversary' Mr. Ritchie presents his version of a prophecy of world destruction precipitated by a shadowy entity referred to only as the Universal Adversary. On view is a theatrical display of kaleidoscopic paintings, a hanging folded black aluminum latticework sky, a video piece and a 40-foot-long light box of illuminated images. Brave souls can ascend to the top of the latticework sky courtesy of a rickety spiral staircase, where there is a suspended viewing platform leading out to an oculus onto which is a projection of a parallel world. The precise meaning of all of this is not easy to grasp, but somehow, together, it feels agonizingly pertinent. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)    DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. In the end the visual results are too familiarly antique to seem worth the either the hidden effort, indirectness or destruction. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460; closes tomorrow.

LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.

Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners that include a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)    'ASCENSION' Brandon Ruckdashel makes a stunning debut in Edmund De Santis's clever comic mystery about a priest, a beautiful young man and a mother's accusation of sexual abuse (1:30). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates)    'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BLUE DOOR' An African-American math professor struggles to reconnect to his cultural past in this small but densely packed new play by Tanya Barfield. Reg E. Cathey is the professor, abandoned by his wife and visited by the ghosts of his ancestors, all played by the vibrant young actor Andre Holland (1:35). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates)    'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring André De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'NIXON'S NIXON' Russell Lees's savory political satire takes place on the night before the president announced his resignation. Gerry Bamman and Steve Mellor created the roles of Nixon and Kissinger, respectively, in the original production from 1995, also directed by Jim Simpson, and they return to them with the ease of veteran vaudevillians slipping back into a comfortable partnership (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned lunch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'être is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'HELL HOUSE' Les Freres Corbusier recreate evangelical Christian entertainments in this typically deadpan show (45 minutes).St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Brantley)    'KRANKENHAUS BLUES' Sam Forman's bizarre tale of an actress, a playwright and a clown in a Nazi camp goes off the deep end fast, but there's a great monologue about cheese (1:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'ME, MY GUITAR AND DON HENLEY' Krista Vernoff's saucy, satisfying black comedy is about six very different women in one dying man's complicated family tree (1:40). the 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'TRUTH $(the heart is a million little pieces above all things$)'  The virtuoso storyteller Mike Daisey's new monologue, which addresses issues about lying, memoir and the James Frey scandal, is less funny than his previous work but just as engaging and intellectually curious (1:40). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    '¡EL CONQUISTADOR!' Thaddeus Phillips's one-man show about a hapless Colombian doorman can be slow, but it's also ingenious and an excellent showcase for Mr. Phillips, who would have made a great silent-movie comedian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'DRUG BUDDY'  The aimless Texas drug dealers of David Folwell's slight slacker dramedy are one losers' club we wouldn't mind spending more time with, particularly the engaging lead, Matthew Stadelmann (51 minutes). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Rob Kendt)    'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    * 'THE TOOTH OF CRIME' This highly entertaining revival of Sam Shepard's musical comic-book melodrama about celebrity, mortality and rock 'n' roll may not be the slickest show around. But as directed by George Ferencz, it brings a demystifying clarity to a work often dismissed as a smoky head trip and makes a strong case for ''Tooth'' as one of Mr. Shepard's best plays (2:15). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org.; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ALEX RIDER: OPERATION STORMBREAKER' (PG, 93 minutes) Based on the first in a series of best-selling kid lit adventure novels, the movie debut of Alex Rider, teenage super spy, is a James Bond flick for kids who have never heard of James Bond. (Nathan Lee)    'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott)    * 'DELIVER US FROM EVIL' (No rating, 101 minutes) Amy Berg's urgent, hard-to-watch documentary looks at sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, interviewing victims and their families and, chillingly, a priest who preyed on several California parishes while his superiors apparently looked the other way. (Scott)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Manohla Dargis)    'DRIVING LESSONS' (PG-13, 98 minutes) ''Driving Lessons'' belongs to that hardy niche of British comedies designed as star vehicles for distinguished actresses (preferably dames) of a certain age whose assignment is to win awards by devouring the scenery. If Julie Walters isn't yet a dame, her hammy portrayal of a retired actress who hires as her assistant a shy 17-year-old boy (Rupert Grint) from a strict Christian background is a step in that direction. (Stephen Holden)    'EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH' (PG, 103 minutes) A minimum-wage comedy chronicling the romance between a slacker box boy (Dane Cook) and a bodacious cashier (Jessica Simpson) working at a Costco-like megastore. Directed by Greg Coolidge with the creative flair of an entry-level training video, the movie is more tired than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'THE GRUDGE 2' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Puberty sets off an exponential increase in evil -- and incoherence -- in Takashi Shimizu's continuing saga about a Japanese wraith with a fondness for neck-snapping and Goth makeup. What's new is an Altmanesque cast of victims, vaporized according to stupidity and/or sluttiness. What's old are the defective light bulbs, scummy bath water and camerawork that makes even teenage flesh look mottled. What's sad is that ''The Grudge 3'' is already in the works. (Catsoulis)    * 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)    * 'HAIR HIGH' (No rating, 78 minutes) Bill Plympton's gleefully outrageous animated feature has teenage romance, a big game with a halftime show that would make Janet Jackson blush, and, of course, a prom where death comes calling. It's eye-popping -- sometimes literally. (Neil Genzlinger)    'INFAMOUS' (R, 118 minutes) Truman Capote -- again! -- on the trail of ''In Cold Blood.'' It is warmer and more stylish than last year's ''Capote'' -- with fine performances by Toby Jones as Truman and Sandra Bullock as his pal Harper Lee -- but also thinner. (Scott)    'JUSTICE' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Portuguese) Maria Ramos's documentary following a few cases of petty crime through low-level Brazilian courts views editing as a vice; why indicate a walk down a hallway when you can show the entire long shuffle? The minimalist technique is deliberate, of course, and it admirably reveals the tedium of life for defendants, lawyers and judges alike, but any broader point is up to you. (Genzlinger)    'KETTLE OF FISH' (R, 93 minutes) Casting Gina Gershon as a mousy scientist (yeah, right) is the first mistake, though by no means the last, in this deeply misguided romantic comedy. (Lee)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    'MAN OF THE YEAR' (PG-13, 115 minutes) Robin Williams plays a comedian and talk show host who plunges into the presidential campaign, telling truths the timid politicians dare not utter. Not really. This would-be satire, written and directed by Barry Levinson, is hectic and tired, with too many plots and too few sharp insights. (Scott)    * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott) 'THE MARINE' (PG-13, 93 minutes) Discharged from the Marine corps, John Triton returns home to find obnoxious yuppies, psychotic diamond thieves, a kidnapped wife and exploding gas stations. (Lee)    * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)    'THE RITCHIE BOYS' (No rating, 90 minutes, in English, with some subtitled German) Though it may seem more like a History Channel special than a film for theatrical release, this documentary by Christian Bauer is an elegant entry in the Greatest Generation genre. It tells the story of a group of young Jewish men who fled Germany before the war, then volunteered for intelligence work with the American military when the fighting broke out. The ''boys'' -- named for the camp where they were trained, and now aging gentlemen -- tell their own story in a series of engaging anecdotes. (Genzlinger)    'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis)    * 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)    'SWEET LAND' (PG, 110 minutes) There's a tartness at the center of Ali Selim's sentimental tale of the prejudice faced by a German mail-order bride (Elizabeth Reaser) who arrives in 1920 Minnesota to marry a Norwegian farmer (Tim Guinee) she has never seen. The film's guileless, heartfelt style veers perilously close to corny at times, but the superb cast dares you to mock. Lovingly filmed in glorious 35-millimeter, the movie celebrates an old-fashioned love born of backbreaking work and shared difficulties, while the endless wheat fields and magnificent skyline seem reason enough to endure. (Catsoulis)    'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash begs the question: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee)    'TIDELAND' (R, 120 minutes) Terry Gilliam, usually bold in his explorations of the boundary between fantasy and reality, here stumbles into a different frontier, the one that separates the merely bad from the utterly inexcusable. (Scott)    Film Series    THE JAPANESE FILM: A TRIBUTE TO DONALD RICHIE (Through Oct. 28) The Museum of the Moving Image honors Mr. Richie, the American-born screenwriter and film historian, with a two-weekend program of his selections and his own short films. This weekend's features include Akira Kurosawa's ''Rashomon'' (1951), the classic about one crime from four points of view, and Yasujiro Ozu's ''Tokyo Story'' (1953), about an elderly couple visiting their grown children in the big city. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates)    POLICE PARIS NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL: FROM THE STREETS TO THE SCREEN (Through tomorrow) The French Institute Alliance Française is sponsoring a three-day series of French films written and directed by former police officers. This weekend's features include Claude Zidi's comedy sequel ''Ripoux 3'' (2003), about old police department pals on a money laundering case in Paris's Chinatown; Alain Corneau's drama ''Le Cousin'' (1997), about a narcotics officer; and Olivier Marchal's ''36 Quai des Orfèvres'' (2004), starring Daniel Auteuil and Gérard Depardieu as ambitious cops competing for a promotion. Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $9. (Gates)    PORDENONE SILENT FILM WEEKEND (Through Sunday) BAMcinématek's four-day selection of highlights from the annual Pordenone silent-movie festival in Italy continues. Features include a Lillian Gish double feature, ''Enoch Arden'' (1915) and ''The Lily and the Rose'' (1915); ''The Triumph of the Rat'' (1926), starring Ivor Novello as a jewel thief trying to go straight in high society; and Anthony Asquith's masterpiece ''A Cottage on Dartmoor'' (1929), about a small-town romantic triangle. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    OTTO PREMINGER: NOTORIOUS (Through Oct. 29) The Museum of Modern Arts's nine-film retrospective of Preminger's work (he would have turned 100 this year) continues this weekend with three films. ''Laura'' (1944) is his classic Manhattan murder mystery. ''Carmen Jones'' (1954) is an African-American musical version of Bizet's opera. And ''Skidoo'' (1968) is an odd little comedy starring Jackie Gleason and Carol Channing as car-wash owners. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10.

BETTIE SERVEERT (Wednesday) Bettie Serveert -- a Dutch band led by Carol van Dijk, who sings in fluent English -- has persevered since the early 1990's on the collegiate-rock circuit. Ms. van Dijk writes and sings observant songs about romantic ups and downs, continually expanding a musical vocabulary that now stretches from pop tunefulness to indie-rock guitar furor to the easy-rolling incantations of Van Morrison. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    FRANK BLACK (Tonight and Monday) Don't expect those baby-crying-in-hell screams that Frank Black (as Black Francis) relied on to spike his Pixies songs with terror and raw sexual angst. As a solo artist, he has been veering into gentle and reflective, if sometimes cheerlessly dry, territory. His most recent two albums, ''Honeycomb'' and ''Fast Man Raider Man'' (Back Porch) -- both underrated -- were recorded in Nashville with master country-soul session men like Spooner Oldham and Steve Cropper. Also on the bill is his longtime New York opening act, the gravelly-voiced grumbler Reid Paley. Tonight at 9, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; Monday at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Ben Sisario)    ROSANNE CASH (Tonight) Always an introspective songwriter, Ms. Cash has said that the songs on her latest album, ''Black Cadillac'' (Capitol) -- about the deaths, in quick succession, of her father, Johnny Cash; her stepmother, June Carter Cash; and her mother, Vivian Liberto Cash Distin -- represent a shift to even deeper and more personal material. She plays an acoustic set of songs from ''Black Cadillac'' and throughout her career. At 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $43. (Sisario)    CELTIC FIDDLE FESTIVAL (Sunday) Three master fiddlers offer a collaborative primer of three branches of the Celtic style. Kevin Burke, born in London to Irish parents, plays in the ornamental Sligo style of Ireland; Christian Lemaître represents Brittany, France's Celtic region. André Brunet, a young Canadian player, has the daunting task of replacing Johnny Cunningham, a pillar of the international Celtic scene who began touring with Mr. Burke and Mr. Lemaître in the early 90's, and who died three years ago at 46. They are accompanied by the English guitarist Ged Foley. At 7 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 545-7536, symphonyspace.org or heartheworld.org; $27, $15 for students. (Sisario)    CHEETAH GIRLS (Tonight and tomorrow) Behold the new teenage pop: it is female, its reference points are sexed-up strutters like the Pussycat Dolls and Christina Aguilera, and it has the Disney seal of approval. The Cheetah Girls began as a Disney Channel movie, and the group's latest album (the soundtrack to the sequel) opened in the Top 5. Also on the bill is Vanessa Anne Hudgens, one of the never-frowning stars of ''High School Musical,'' the smash Disney Channel movie whose soundtrack is the best-selling album this year. Tonight at 7, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; tomorrow at 4 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $25.50 to $42. (Sisario)    DEICIDE (Tonight) For all its militancy -- lyrics vilifying Christianity, studded breastplates, beefy arms -- this Florida band makes unremarkable meat-and-potatoes death metal: buzz-saw guitar themes in minor modes give way to fast, narrow two-beat drum thrashing. Glen Benton, the leader and demagogue, uses the genre's generic low growl; it's business as usual, no big deal. (He also prefers to present himself as being against organized religion rather than, uh, pro-Satan.) With Nachtmystium, Daath, Embalmer, Desolation, Annunaki and Dimentianon. At 8, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $25. (Ben Ratliff)    FLOETRY (Wednesday and Thursday) Cooing melodies meet socially conscious rapping in this English duo, which allies a rapper, Natalie Stewart, and a singer, Marsha Ambrosius. They boast, preach positive thinking and delve into love, articulating uncertainties along with lust. With Emily King. At 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Pareles)    THE FRAY (Wednesday and Thursday) This Denver band has the No. 1 song on iTunes with ''How to Save a Life,'' a gushy piano ballad that, like all the Counting Crows, Wallflowers, Coldplay and Keane songs whose template it studiously follows, features a man meekly apologizing to the woman who dumps him. (Maybe she grew tired of creepy let's-be-friends lines like, ''I would have stayed up with you all night.'') At 7:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; sold out. (Sisario)    GOOGOOSH (Tomorrow) In pre-revolutionary Iran, Googoosh was Iran's Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Édith Piaf and Madonna rolled into one: not just a magnificent singer but also a fashion trailblazer and a symbol of modernity. Her songs were romantic, not political, and while they drew on Western styles, they held onto both the fervor of Persian love poetry and the sliding, quivering, impassioned phrasing of traditional Persian music. With Mehrdad. At 9 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $54.50 to $254.50. (Pareles)    GOTAN PROJECT (Wednesday) Tango meets late-night chill-out electronica in the music of this stylish Paris trio, and thanks to tasteful restraint and some studio finesse, the gimmick works. Its latest album, ''Lunático'' (XL), expands the palette a bit further with guest appearances by the mariachi-and-surf-guitar Arizona band Calexico and some rap. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)    JOLIE HOLLAND (Tonight) With a playful quiver of a voice, like a countryfied Billie Holiday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming and deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. With David Dondero. At 7:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. (Sisario)    * THE KILLERS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Big-league arrogance is nothing new in a rising rock band, but not many have the songwriting chops to back it up the way the Killers do. Two years ago this Las Vegas quartet became instant stars with ''Hot Fuss,'' a hit-packed album whose adrenalized update of new-wave pop cloaked some of the blasé cynicism of its lyrics (''Dreams aren't what they used to be''). This month the band released ''Sam's Town'' (Island/Def Jam), which is grandiose and aloof where its predecessor was sharp and hungry, though it still has a few songs you won't easily get out of your head. With Red Romance. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; sold out. (Sisario)    MARITIME (Tomorrow) Founded by former members of the Promise Ring and the Dismemberment Plan, two bands that in the mid-90's did as much as any to establish the emo sound, Maritime plays understated and effortlessly catchy songs with minimal touches of acoustic guitar and new-wave keyboards. With Bound Stems, the Secret Life of Sofia and Heather Duby. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)    * MILTON NASCIMENTO (Monday through Thursday) A somewhat rare club appearance by Mr. Nascimento, one of Brazil's greatest songwriters as well as a singer of gentle and entrancing purity. His band will include Gastão Villeroy on bass, Wilson Lopes on guitar, Kiko Continentino at the piano and Lincoln Cheib on the drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $55 at tables, $35 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Sisario)    * JOHNNY PACHECO TRIBUTE (Tonight) The Fania All-Stars, the great salsa mafia that ruled New York Latin music in the 70's, pays tribute to its founder and musical director, the Dominican flutist and bandleader Johnny Pacheco, who is celebrating 50 years of making music. The lineup spans several generations of Latin stars: Bobby Valentín, Ismael Miranda, Jimmy Bosch, Roberto Roena, Papo Lucca, Adalberto Santiago, Yomo Toro, Nicky Marrero, Eddie Montalvo and others. At 8, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $69.50 to $109.50. (Sisario)    SCISSOR SISTERS (Tomorrow) You would be forgiven if you didn't know that the Scissor Sisters were one of the most popular New York City bands in the world: despite Top 10 success in Britain with its almost parodically falsetto-heavy disco-soul, the group has struggled for attention at home. Its main songwriters, the singer Jake Shears and the bassist Babbydaddy, can crank out some very entertaining dance-floor anthems, but as its recently released second album, ''Ta-Dah'' (Universal), makes clear, this sound can go on forever without much development, and the Bee Gees and George Michael wrote better songs. With Small Sins. At 8 p.m., the Grand Ballroom at Manhattan Center, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; sold out. (Sisario)    SIERRA LEONE'S REFUGEE ALL STARS  (Tuesday) These six musicians, ranging from a teenage rapper to a guitarist in his 50's, fled civil war in their homeland for a refugee camp in rural Guinea. They formed a band there four years ago, and tell their stories in songs tinged with soul and reggae. A documentary about them, made by Zach Niles and Banker White, will be shown at 7:30 p.m., and the band will go on at 9. S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)    PAUL SIMON (Tomorrow) At 64, Mr. Simon, who in the 1960's conquered the dorm rooms of the world with a sweetened, sharpened revision of coffeehouse folk, and in the 80's virtually created the idea of the world-music crossover, this year released one of his most adventurous albums, ''Surprise'' (Warner Brothers). Produced by Brian Eno (David Bowie, Talking Heads, U2) along with Mr. Simon, it accompanies his voice with bubbly and slightly disorienting electronics, and the two elements interact as discrete, parallel planes. With Jerry Douglas, a master of the bluegrass Dobro. At 7:30 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $39.50 to $129.50. (Sisario)    PATTI SMITH (Tonight) Fresh from her appearance at CBGB as the club's eulogist -- singing her own otherworldly rhapsodies, like ''Birdland,'' as well as raw-throated punk-rock classics like the Dead Boys' ''Sonic Reducer'' -- Ms. Smith heads to another, quieter New York institution, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to celebrate heroes of French culture. Baudelaire, Rimbaud and Juliet Greco are among those she and a circle of friends are to honor with poetry and music, but the focus of the evening will be Joan of Arc, specifically Jules Bastien-Lepage's enormous and endlessly mesmerizing 1879 painting of her, in the Met's permanent collection. At 8, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Sisario)    THE STRAWBS (Tomorrow) Led by David Cousins, the Strawbs were part of the British trad-rock movement of the late 1960's and 70's, reaching back to modal Celtic melodies and the lore of ancient ballads. This version of the band is unplugged, with Mr. Cousins, Dave Lambert and Chas Cronk. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Pareles)    ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. (Through Nov. 4.) At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden)    * SUISHOU NO FUNE (Tuesday and Thursday) This Tokyo group, whose name means ship of crystal, carries on a decades-long tradition in underground Japanese rock of immersion in both tranquil, spooky psychedelia and rumbling sonic chaos. Like Fushitsusha, its earliest ancestor on the Japanese scene, Suishou no Fune is transcendent in either extreme. Tuesday at 9 p.m., with Malkuth and Titan, Club Midway, 25 Avenue B, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 253-2595, clubmidway.com; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. Thursday at 9 p.m., with Magik Markers, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    AHMED ABDULLAH'S EBONIC TONES (Tomorrow) On the recent album ''Tara's Song'' (Tum), the trumpeter Ahmed Abdullah led this ensemble in an exploration of themes by Thelonious Monk and Ornette Coleman, among others. Mr. Abdullah reconvenes the group at Sista's Place, the fiercely independent Brooklyn arts space that he partly oversees. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 756-7600; sistasplace.org; cover, $25 in advance, $30 tomorrow.

(Chinen)    * MARILYN CRISPELL (Tomorrow) Ms. Crispell, a pianist equally celebrated for aggressive atonality and delicate lyricism, reunites with the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Paul Motian, the same team as on her superb 2004 album ''Storyteller'' (ECM). There's a welcome X factor, too: the tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano, a musician capable of shifting from a murmur to a shriek, though he's most comfortable somewhere between the two. At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com; $25. (Chinen)    EDDIE DANIELS 65TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight through Sunday night) The clarinetist Eddie Daniels just reached standard retirement age, though he shows little interest in laying back. Along with Joe Locke on vibraphone, David Finck on bass and Joe La Barbera on drums, he revisits music from a new album, ''Mean What You Say'' (IPO), and records material for a forthcoming live release. At 8:30 and 10:30, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum.

At 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    JIM HALL TRIO (Tonight through Sunday night) Jim Hall's economical style and deep harmonic command have made him a quiet hero of jazz guitar; he leads his regular trio with the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Terry Clarke. At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    JOEL HARRISON (Monday) As a singer as well as a guitarist, Mr. Harrison leans on American roots traditions.

The album's most valuable players, the guitarist Adam Rogers and the drummer Brian Blade, are appearing with him. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30; $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)    MADELEINE PEYROUX/ODETTA (Wednesday) Ms. Peyroux is a coyly reticent songbook crier whose songbook includes Leonard Cohen as well as Johnny Mercer, as she demonstrates on a likable new album called ''Half the Perfect World'' (Rounder). Odetta may as well be her polar opposite: regal and unequivocal, with a voice that emits a deep and certain authority. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $48.50 and $62.50. (Chinen)    ANDREW RATHBUN QUARTET (Wednesday) Andrew Rathbun is a sure-footed tenor and soprano saxophonist, but it is as a composer that he makes his mark, especially when his music is entrusted to improvisers like his fellow tenor player George Garzone, a featured guest here. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8.

(Chinen)    TYSHAWN SOREY'S OBLIQUE/DAN WEISS TRIO (Tomorrow) Tyshawn Sorey is an often explosive drummer, but he brings some compositional subtlety to his main ensemble, which includes the alto saxophonist Loren Stillman and the trombonist Ben Gerstein. Dan Weiss, also a drummer, is well versed in Indian classical music, as well as in rock and modern jazz; he plays a later set with his frequent colleagues the pianist Jacob Sacks and the bassist Thomas Morgan. At 8 and 10 p.m., Rose Live Music, 345 Grand Street, near Marcy Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-0069, newlanguages.org; $10. (Chinen)    * TOMASZ STANKO QUARTET (Wednesday and Thursday) The Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko is one of Europe's most heralded jazz musicians, and he has roundly earned his accolades. ''Lontano'' (ECM) is his third album with a gifted younger rhythm section made up of the pianist Marcin Wasilewski, the bassist Slawomir Kurkiewicz and the drummer Michal Miskiewicz; it's a shimmering, gently abstract and warmly luminescent work, likely to sound even better in the flesh. (Through Oct. 28.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    GERALD WILSON AND THE JUILLIARD JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Wilson, the venerable composer and arranger, last appeared in New York as a guest conductor of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. This club engagement is less of an occasion, but it should place his gift as an educator in clearer focus. (Through Oct. 29.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.

Opera    'LA BOHÈME' (Tonight and Wednesday) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of the New York City Opera's best productions. A new cast has taken over for the rest of this run, which ends on Wednesday, including two singers new to the company, Inna Dukach as Mimi, and Robert Gardner as Marcello. Dinyar Vania will sing Rodolfo, Dana Beth Miller is the Musetta, Kyungmook Yum is Schaunard, and Eric Jordan is Colline. Steven Mosteller conducts.

(Anne Midgette)    'CARMEN' (Sunday and Thursday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, the New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. The high point of this cast is Latonia Moore as a radiant-voiced Micaëla. On Thursday night, a new cast takes over: Vanessa Cariddi, Kerri Marcinko and Daesan No will make their company debuts as Carmen, Micaëla and Escamillo, and Gary Thor Wedow will replace Ari Pelto in the pit. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 tickets remaining on Sunday, $25 to $125 on Thursday. (Midgette)    'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA'/'PAGLIACCI' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) Even for its war horses, the Metropolitan Opera is pulling out some big vocal stops. Of interest in this classic double bill is the appearance of Salvatore Licitra, a tenor who has the vocal goods but has not always fully shown them, as Leoncavallo's Canio, alongside the Nedda of the luminous Patricia Racette, and the always dramatic Maria Guleghina as Santuzza in ''Cavalleria.'' Marco Armiliato conducts. Tonight and Thursday night at 8, Monday night at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $275. (Midgette)    'COSÌ FAN TUTTE' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Mozart's fantastic battle of the sexes arrives in a New York City Opera production, with a cast that includes Julianna Di Giacomo as Fiordiligi; Sandra Piques Eddy as Dorabella; Ryan MacPherson as Ferrando; Kyle Pfortmiller as Guglielmo and James Maddalena as Don Alfonso. Julius Rudel returns to its podium for this production. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.; Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 tickets remaining tomorrow, $25 to $125 on Tuesday. (Allan Kozinn)    'THE ELIXIR OF LOVE' (Tomorrow) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American version of Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elisir'' is a delightful opera, and it's decently sung by Anna Skibinsky, an Adina with a little ribbon of a voice; John Tessier, an honest, solid, if North American Nemorino; and especially Jan Opalach, who has a lot of fun and sounds very good as Dulcamara. George Manahan's conducting is not exactly Italianate. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)    'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow) The Metropolitan Opera's barn-burning, old-fashioned production has a Saturday matinee, still with Violeta Urmana in the title role, and now offering Olga Savova as Laura and Eduardo Villa as Enzo. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; remaining tickets, $42 to $375. (Bernard Holland)    * 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The abstract staging of Anthony Minghella's visually beautiful production of ''Madama Butterfly'' deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-size puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly, and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Lieutenant Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)    'RIGOLETTO' (Wednesday) Otto Schenk's grimly realistic production of Verdi's ''Rigoletto,'' will provide a showcase for a veritable night of debuts at the house. The German soprano Ekaterina Siurina as Gilda, the Malta-born lyric tenor Joseph Calleja as the Duke of Mantua, and the Austrian conductor Friedrich Haider are all making their company debuts. In the title role the veteran baritone Juan Pons should be a steadying influence on his new colleagues. At 8 p.m., the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Tommasini)    Classical Music    * ALARM WILL SOUND (Tonight and tomorrow night) Even in the lively world of new-music ensembles, few groups assemble programs as imaginatively, or perform with as much zest, as Alarm Will Sound. For its residency at the Kitchen, the group is performing works by Harrison Birtwistle, Benedict Mason and Dennis DeSantis, one of several composers who also perform in the group, as well as arrangements of Conlon Nancarrow's player-piano pieces and a group of rhythmically complex works from the 14th century. At 8:30, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; $12.

(Holland)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) Robert White, the Irish tenor, is the George Hamilton of the vocal world: an unbowed, ageless veteran. This weekend Bargemusic is celebrating his birthday. (The organizers aren't saying, but it's his 65th.) They are presenting songs, works for piano trio and a few pieces that combine both. Mr. White will sing; the composer Lowell Liebermann will be the pianist (the program includes two of his works); Mark Peskanov, Bargemusic's president and executive director, and Darrett Adkins will join in on violin and cello. Tonight, before the celebration begins, the cellist Robert Cohen and the pianist Paul Ostrovsky offer a varied program, from Mozart to Bruch. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students.

The first program offers works by Schubert, Mendelssohn and Schumann and culminates in Brahms's lushly scored and elegant String Sextet in G. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Tommasini)    * CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA (Wednesday) This opening concert in Kent Tritle's superb Sacred Music in a Sacred Space series includes Handel's Coronation Anthem, ''The King Shall Rejoice''; Carl Philip Emanuel Bach's ''Magnificat''; and Randall Thompson's exquisite setting of texts from Isaiah, ''The Peaceable Kingdom.''

At 8 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212) 288-2520, saintignatiusloyola.org; $35 to $45, and $25 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)    BEN HEPPNER (Wednesday) If any tenor has the voice to command a vocal recital in Carnegie Hall it is Mr. Heppner, who sings Grieg, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky and Tosti. The pianist is Thomas Muraco. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $25 to $82. (Holland)    * KIROV ORCHESTRA (Monday and Tuesday) Last spring Valery Gergiev began his survey of the complete 15 symphonies by Shostakovich, part of Lincoln Center's tribute to the composer for the centennial of his birth. The series continues this week with Mr. Gergiev conducting the Kirov Orchestra of the Maryinsky Theater in Nos. 11 (''The Year 1905'') and 6 on Monday night, and Nos. 12 (''The Year 1917'') and 14 on Tuesday. Mr. Gergiev's spring performances were by turns volatile, bitter, searing and darkly beautiful. Expect the same. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $69. (Tommasini)    BRAD LUBMAN'S ELECTRIC FUZZ (Tonight) The American Composers Orchestra is looking into the world of composer-performers this season, presenting several composers and their ensembles at Joe's Pub.

At 7, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, americancomposers.org; $20. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) There are two more chances this weekend to see Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 cinematic masterpiece ''Alexander Nevsky'' at Avery Fisher Hall, with Prokofiev's pulsating score played live by the Philharmonic under its dynamic young associate conductor, Xian Zhang. On Thursday the British-born conductor Jonathan Nott, a champion of contemporary music, comes to the Philharmonic for a program that juxtaposes two works by Beethoven, the seldom-heard ''King Stephen'' Overture and his Fifth Symphony, with two 20th-century scores, Gyorgy Ligeti's atmospheric ''Lontano'' and Bartok's rhapsodic Piano Concerto No. 1. The pianist Peter Serkin is the soloist. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96.

Vladimir Ashkenazy conducts the NHK and the Dessoff Symphonic Choir, and Hélène Grimaud is the pianist. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $26 to $87. (Holland)    IVO POGORELICH (Thursday) This iconoclastic Croatian pianist has struck some listeners as brilliantly original, and others as purely perverse, but in any case, his interpretations of the great 19th-century keyboard works are unlike anyone else's. He appears here this week with a hefty program that includes sonatas by Chopin (No. 3), Rachmaninoff (No. 2) and Scriabin (No. 4). At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $60.

Then the birthday boy and the ensemble he founded, Steve Reich and Musicians, will join Synergy Vocals to play ''Music for 18 Musicians.'' On Sunday Mr. Reich will perform ''Cello Counterpoint'' (with Maya Beiser), ''Piano/Video Phase'' and ''Drumming.''

(Vivien Schweitzer)    * RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Wednesday) The impressive Riverside Symphony, conducted by George Rothman, opens its 26th season with a typically intriguing lineup. Stravinsky's eclectic Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra precedes the early Symphony No. 1 by the living French master Henri Dutilleux, a composer this orchestra has championed. Two lesser-known Prokofiev works conclude the program: the Chant Symphonique and a suite from the ballet score ''The Prodigal Son.'' At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, riversidesymphony.org; $30 to $50; students, half-price.

Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; Wednesday at 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $60. (Holland)    SPHINX CHAMBER ORCHESTRA/HARLEM QUARTET (Tuesday) The goal is to get black and Hispanic students involved with classical music. A continuing result, or a part of it, can be heard in the Carnegie Hall performance by winners of the Sphinx competition. The winners -- as soloists, members of the Sphinx Chamber Orchestra or as the Harlem Quartet (in its Carnegie debut) -- play Mozart, Marsalis and a range of music in between. The orchestra is an outgrowth of the Sphinx Organization, a 10-year-old nonprofit that has provided scholarships and instruments to thousands of students, and its last Carnegie gala was said to be first-rate. At 6 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 to $80. (Midgette)    YSAE QUARTET (Sunday) This string quartet, formed more than two decades ago by students at the Paris Conservatory, returns to the Frick Collection's music room with a program that includes Haydn's Quartet in F (Op. 77, No. 2); Debussy's Quartet in G minor; and Schumann's Quartet in A. The concert by the Ysae can also be heard free via a sound system in the Garden Court. At 5 p.m., 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'A DEAF ARTIST IN EARLY AMERICA: THE WORLDS OF JOHN BREWSTER JR.,' through Jan. 7. Few Early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Brewster was born deaf before remedial help or a common sign language existed. The case the show makes for Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    * ASIA SOCIETY: 'GILDED SPLENDOR: TREASURES OF CHINA'S LIAO EMPIRE (907-1125),' through Dec. 31. For a thousand years the Khitan, who established the Liao Empire, were dismissed by Chinese historians, but they have been redeemed by late-20th-century archaeological discoveries. The evidence is laid out in this show of more than 200 objects excavated from tombs, temples and walled cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. The first major display of Liao objects outside China, the show gives the lie to the idea of the Khitan as cultural nobodies. .Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Grace Glueck)    * BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, 'TROPICALIA: A REVOLUTION IN BRAZILIAN CULTURE,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960's like a sunshower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. The Bronx Museum's absorbing, inevitably diffuse show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING,' through Dec. 31. Weighing in at six works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Roberta Smith)    * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,'  through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck)    * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. The artist will discuss his works Sunday afternoon at the museum. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck)    * THE MET: SET IN STONE: THE FACE IN MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE, through Feb. 19. This show brings together nearly 80 carved, mostly limestone heads, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries. There are excellent side trips, into the grotesque, the influence of the antique, the glimmers of the Renaissance and a new isotope-matching technique helping to divine which heads come from where. The treatments of hair and beard with which medieval sculptors were more at ease than they were with, say, eyes or smiles, are almost a show within a show. (See above) (Smith)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'LUMINIST HORIZONS: THE ART AND COLLECTION OF JAMES A. SUYDAM,' through Dec. 31. These days Mr. Suydam is remembered, if at all, as a 19th-century American Luminist painter whose reputation has all but sunk quietly into the New England salt meadows that he loved to paint. This exhibition has a few aims, one of which is a kind of art historical search and rescue operation. Mr. Suydam's early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were an extremely talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)    * NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)     RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)    * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: MARK GROTJAHN, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shieldlike frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)    THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Chelsea    * KAREN KILIMNIK Ms. Kilimnik's sharp, witty, low-key show is spun around a Napoleonic theme, with a full-scale battle tent sitting in the gallery and paintings of Géricaultian steeds and soldiers inside and out. But any incipient Romanticism is cut with impurities -- walk-ons from Hollywood, refugees from Allure magazine -- as if to keep everything off balance and confused. Although Ms. Kilimnik has a reputation as a celebrity fantasist, she's a conceptual artist with a cool, watchful, resistant eye. Everyone agrees that full recognition of her accomplishment and influence is long overdue. May it begin here. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, through Nov. 4. (Cotter)    Last Chance    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu; closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)    GUILD HALL MUSEUM: 'ELIZABETH PEYTON PRINTS 1998-2006,' Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Jacqueline Kennedy and her young son, John, are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. Romantic feeling connects the form and content in Ms. Peyton's work. To paint, her works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806, guildhall.org/museum.ihtml; closes on Sunday. (Ken Johnson)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'NADINE ROBINSON: ALLES GRAU,' 'QUID PRO QUO: RASHAWN GRIFFIN, KARYN OLIVIER AND CLIFFORD OWEN: 2005-06 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE' AND 'BEYOND SIGHT,'  The Studio Museum is looking sharp with three concurrent shows, the outstanding one being a single big sound-sculpture by Nadine Robinson. It expands her political purview from imperialism to Armageddon, with hundreds of speakers embedded in an 11-foot-high gray-black wall unit that generate a sampling of satanic film scores (''The Omen,'' ''The Matrix''), mixed with funeral chants and Rastafarian dance music. ''Quid Pro Quo'' is a showcase for the 2005-6 artists in residence, all interdisciplinarians with a sweet-and-sour Dadaist touch. Mr. Owens, with performance, looks intriguingly volatile. And you won't want to leave the museum without checking out ''Beyond Sight,'' the work of 14 teenagers. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseuminharlem.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)    DONA NELSON The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, Chelsea, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com; closes tomorrow.

'THE VOYAGE OF THE CARCASS' In previews; opens on Monday. Dan Fogler (''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'') plays one of the three surviving members of the SS Carcass. Or is he just an actor in a play within a play (2:30)? SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515.    Broadway    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners that include a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)    'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BLUE DOOR' An African-American math professor struggles to reconnect to his cultural past in this small but densely packed new play by Tanya Barfield. Reg E. Cathey is the math prof, abandoned by his wife and visited by the ghosts of his ancestors, all played by the vibrant young actor Andre Holland (1:35). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'DRUG BUDDY'  The aimless Texas drug dealers of David Folwell's slight slacker dramedy are one losers' club we wouldn't mind spending more time with, particularly the engaging lead, Matthew Stadelmann. But ''Drug Buddy'' leaves barely a bruise, let alone a buzz (51 minutes). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Rob Kendt)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Zinoman)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates)    'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring André De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'NIXON'S NIXON' Russell Lees's savory political satire takes place on the night before the president announced his resignation. Gerry Bamman and Steve Mellor created the roles of Nixon and Kissinger, respectively, in the original production from 1995, also directed by Jim Simpson, and they return to them with the ease of veteran vaudevillians slipping back into a comfortable partnership (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    * 'THE TOOTH OF CRIME' This highly entertaining revival of Sam Shepard's musical comic-book melodrama about celebrity, mortality and rock 'n' roll may not be the slickest show around. But as directed by George Ferencz, it brings a demystifying clarity to a work often dismissed as a smoky head trip and makes a strong case for ''Tooth'' as one of Mr. Shepard's best plays (2:15). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Brantley)    'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)    'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned lunch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison-d'etre is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    '¡EL CONQUISTADOR!' Thaddeus Phillips's one-man show about a hapless Colombian doorman can be slow, but it's also ingenious and an excellent showcase for Mr. Phillips, who would have made a great silent-movie comedian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley)    Last Chance    'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday.

(Gates)    'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH'  A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie.

(Isherwood)    'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00).

'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott)    'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)    'BLACK GOLD' (No rating, 78 minutes, in English, Oromifa and Amharic) This documentary tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story. The giants in this case are multinational corporations that control the worldwide coffee market. The heroic little guy, Tadesse Meskela, who represents the Oromo Coffee Farmers Co-op Union, devotes himself tirelessly to traveling the world looking for buyers who will pay a fair price for the beans harvested by the country's 70,000 coffee farmers. (Stephen Holden)    'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julián Hernández's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)    'EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH' (PG, 103 minutes) A minimum-wage comedy chronicling the romance between a slacker box boy (Dane Cook) and a bodacious cashier (Jessica Simpson) working at a Costco-like megastore. Directed by Greg Coolidge with the creative flair of an entry-level training video, the movie is tireder than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott)    'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee)    'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)    * 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)    'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott)    * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)    'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)    * 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee)    'JET LI'S FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee)    'KETTLE OF FISH' (R, 93 minutes) Casting Gina Gershon as a mousy scientist (yeah, right) is the first mistake, though by no means the last, in this deeply misguided romantic comedy. (Lee)    'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)    'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern)    * 'OUT OF PLACE: MEMORIES OF EDWARD SAID' and 'EDWARD SAID: THE LAST INTERVIEW' (No rating, 138 minutes and 114 minutes, in English, Arabic and Hebrew) Two documentaries about the Palestinian writer and thinker Edward Said explore his life, his chronic alienation and his sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Loosely framed by readings from Mr. Said's 1999 memoir of the same title, ''Out of Place: Memories of Edward Said'' is less a biography than a rambling meditation on exile, identity and the psychological scars of dispossession. More satisfying is the complex portrait provided by ''Edward Said: The Last Interview,'' a riveting record of Mr. Said's 2002 conversation with the journalist Charles Glass. Engrossing and wide-ranging, the film proves that a couch, a camera and a great mind can be all the inspiration a filmmaker needs. (Catsoulis)    * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)    'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis)    * 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott)    * 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)    'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash begs the question: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee)    'WRESTLING WITH ANGELS: PLAYWRIGHT TONY KUSHNER' (No rating, 98 minutes) In this entertaining but shallow documentary portrait of the playwright Tony Kushner, its likable subject contradicts the cliché image of the left-wing intellectual as a grim, preachy commissar of political correctness. He comes across as a welcoming public figure who has a gift for being very funny and serious at the same time. (Holden)    Film Series    'ÉCLATS DE RIRE' (Through Oct. 31) The French Institute Alliance Française is screening French comedies every Tuesday. This week's films are Josiane Balasko's ''Gazon Maudit'' (1995), about a husband-wife-lesbian ménage à trois, and Albert Dupontel's ''Bernie'' (1996), about a 30-year-old orphan in search of his parents.

(Gates)    'MADE IN NY; (Through Dec. 31) The Museum of Modern Art's three-month series of notable films made in the city continues this weekend with a half-dozen features. They include Woody Allen's ''Manhattan'' (1979), with its adoring shots of bridges, parks and gardens; Louis Malle's two-man feast, ''My Dinner With André'' (1981); and Gordon Parks's ''Shaft'' (1971), about detective style in Harlem.

Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    'OTTO PREMINGER: NOTORIOUS' (Through Oct. 29) The Museum of Modern Art's nine-film retrospective of Preminger's work (he would have turned 100 this year) continues this weekend with ''Advise and Consent'' (1962). The film, about Washingtonians who maneuver, stars Henry Fonda and a scene-stealing Charles Laughton. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock 'n' roll needs to celebrate as well as ridicule its own mythology, and Art Brut, sarcastically but exuberantly singing about the thrill of plugging in and making a ruckus -- ''Formed a band, we formed a band/Look at us, we formed a band!'' -- is one of the rare groups that can do both. With Spinto Band. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $17.50 in advance, $19 at the door.

(Ben Sisario)    BECK (Wednesday) Since he broke through with the slacker anthem ''Loser'' in 1994, Beck has waffled between snidely ironic hip-hop pastiche and glum acoustic balladry. His latest, ''The Information'' (Interscope), is in the hip-hop category, with the kind of pop-culture crazy-quilt lyrics that only Beck could come up with: ''I got a silicon Bible song/Paranoid Jumbotron.'' With Spank Rock. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $54.50. (Sisario)    * CBGB (Tonight through Sunday) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the storied Bowery dive that in the 1970's incubated New York's greatest generation of punk rock. The club must close by the end of the month, and the shows this weekend have been billed as its last. The Dictators, whose muscular three-chord chants are paragons of tidy melody and obnoxious humor, play tonight and tomorrow night. Also tomorrow, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie offer an acoustic set. Sunday night is the big blowout with Patti Smith and her band. At 8 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; sold out. (Sisario)    C. J. CHENIER (Sunday) The son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, C. J. Chenier picked up his father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Jon Pareles)    DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND (Tonight) The magnificent ensemble that revitalized New Orleans brass-band music. It swaggers through the city's whole musical heritage: parades, rumba, swing, bebop and modern jazz, for starters. Solos can head for the far side of tonality, but the band never loses touch with gutbucket, danceable funk. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $19.

(Sisario)    VINCE GILL (Monday) This sweet-voiced country classicist is touring with a 17-piece band and an especially big addition to his repertory: on Tuesday he will release ''These Days'' (MCA Nashville), a four-CD set of all new material, featuring Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, Michael McDonald, Gretchen Wilson, LeAnn Rimes and enough other stars to fill a downtown Nashville honky-tonk. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35 to $50.

(Sisario)    JOLIE HOLLAND (Wednesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming, deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. With David Dondero. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door.

With Roman Candle. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $30 and $40. (Pareles)     * LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO (Tuesday) This great South African vocal group, which introduced so much of the world to close, bass-heavy Zulu harmony on Paul Simon's ''Graceland,'' is at Carnegie Hall for the first time since appearing with Mr. Simon there 19 years ago. Guests include Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, the Mahotella Queens, Vusi Mahlasela and Pete Seeger. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $21 to $72. (Sisario)    JENNY LEWIS (Tonight) Already the sad-eyed, short-skirted princess of indie rock as the lead singer of Rilo Kiley, Jenny Lewis made an inspired step with her first solo album, whose luscious country-gospel ruminations of romantic and spiritual doubt (''It's not that I believe in your almighty/But I might as well as insurance or bail'') made her its Dusty Springfield as well. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25. (Sisario)    PET SHOP BOYS (Tomorrow) The British duo that perfected the pouty and aloof techno-pop of Human League returned this year with ''Fundamental'' (Capitol), a reunion with Trevor Horn, one of its 1980's producers. Only the Pet Shop Boys can sing jabberwocky lines like ''I thought I heard a train/Down in the cemetery/Cellophane'' and make them sound sexy and evil. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $29.50 to $99.50. (Sisario)    RASCAL FLATTS (Tomorrow) The sweetest, most tooth-rotting bubblegum is always the best. This pop-country trio -- big emphasis on pop -- specializes in a kind of mawkish sentimentality that has to be admired for sheer shamelessness, as in ''Skin (Sarabeth),'' an after-school special with a waltz beat about a girl with leukemia: ''It would be a mistake/For someone to take/A girl with no hair to the prom.'' (Her date shaves his head in sympathy.) At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $44.50 to $84.50. (Sisario)    RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, MARS VOLTA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Though their transformation from sex-mad punk-funk pranksters to crooning penitents is pretty much complete, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are not above the occasional appearance dressed only in tube socks (not on their feet). With the Mars Volta, leaders of the unlikely renaissance of byzantine prog-metal. At 8 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $63. (Sisario)    ROYAL DRUMMERS OF BURUNDI (Tomorrow and Monday) First heard by most Western listeners as the spooky, lusty pulse on Joni Mitchell's 1975 album ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' these musicians and dancers -- who sometimes call themselves the Master Drummers of Burundi, or simply the Drummers of Burundi -- conjure an elemental musical force through ritualized unison percussion. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. Sunday at 3 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $20 to $35. (Sisario)    EARL SCRUGGS (Tonight) Bluegrass banjo as we know it simply would not exist without Earl Scruggs, who joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys in 1945 and proceeded to revolutionize banjo playing with a three-finger picking style that accelerates to ballistic speeds. At 7:45 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40. (Pareles)    ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Thursday) The sitarist Anoushka Shankar, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. At 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $55. (Pareles)    SOCIAL DISTORTION (Tonight) Formed in 1978 by its songwriter, Mike Ness, Social Distortion plays punk-rock with a roots-rock twang. In his songs Mr. Ness is still trying to figure out the meaning of life, chronicling everything from anti-fashion stubbornness to feeling his age. At 8:30, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out.

It includes Daqqa Roudania, a group from Morocco, performing ecstatic, percussion-driven Sufi music and dance; Gerard Edery singing Sephardic songs that hark back to Renaissance music; Susan Hellauer from Anonymous 4, singing Gregorian chant; the South Indian classical singer Aruna Sairam, with Hindu devotional music; and Arabic music from Zafer Tawil, playing oud and violin, and Jamey Haddad on percussion.

(Pareles)    ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden)    TILLY AND THE WALL (Tuesday) An indie-rock band playing tuneful, yearning anthems of sexuality and confusion is nothing new, but this Omaha quintet has one truly unusual (and effective) gimmick: the percussion comes from the manic tap-dancing of one of its members, Jamie Williams. With Northern State. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)    TV ON THE RADIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) One of Brooklyn's most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. With Grizzly Bear. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)    YOU AM I (Wednesday and Thursday) With its exhilarating rave-ups and Tim Rogers's windmill guitar slashes -- both recalling the best of the Who -- You Am I is one of the most exciting bands to come out of Australia in a decade, though it has struggled for recognition here. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15.

She performs here in celebration of her 70th birthday, with instrumental support from the pianist Onaje Allan Gumbs, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Victor Lewis. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)    CHRIS BOTTI/JOHN PIZZARELLI (Tonight) Mr. Botti has emerged as the lite-jazz hero of our time, a trumpeter whose photogenic presence and brooding sensuality both suit the current notion of the standard songbook as a lifestyle accessory. His low-gloss polish is likable, and in concert he tends to stretch out a bit with his band, which is first-rate. For a more buoyant take on jazz-pop crossover, though, look to the other half of this bill, featuring Mr. Pizzarelli, the ever-breezy guitarist and singer. At 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Chinen)    DON BYRON PLAYS JUNIOR WALKER (Tonight through Sunday night) The clarinetist Don Byron has lately been playing more tenor saxophone, a development that motivated his latest concept album, ''Do the Boomerang'' (Blue Note). It's a tribute to the Motown saxophonist-singer Junior Walker, by a clutch of musicians equally at home playing jazz and soul: the guitarist David Gilmore, the keyboardist George Colligan, the bassist Brad Jones and the drummer Rodney Holmes. One of the two vocalists on the album, Chris Thomas King, will also appear. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25; $30 tonight and tomorrow. (Chinen)    REGINA CARTER (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Carter is a jazz violinist of uncommon accomplishment: a few years ago she became the first African-American musician to play Paganini's cherished instrument in Genoa, Italy, and a few weeks ago she received a prestigious ''genius grant'' from the MacArthur Foundation. Her recent album ''I'll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey'' (Verve) honors the memory of her mother by reinterpreting some of the prewar popular songs she loved. (Through Oct. 21.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    STEVE COLEMAN AND FIVE ELEMENTS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Coleman's alto saxophone cuts cleanly through the angular free-funk of his signature ensemble, which includes Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet, Tim Albright on trombone, Jen Shyu on vocals, Tyshawn Sorey on drums and, on Wednesday only, Thomas Morgan on bass. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; members, $10. (Chinen)    COOPER-MOORE QUARTET/MATANA ROBERTS QUARTET (Tomorrow) The man known as Cooper-Moore, an extreme polyglot even by avant-garde standards, leads a band that features his own handmade instruments alongside the alto saxophone of Darius Jones and the percussion of Juma Santos and Chad Taylor. Matana Roberts, a husky-toned alto saxophonist and junior member of the A.A.C.M., is at her best when responding to ensemble actions; her group, performing in a later set, includes the tenor saxophonist Matt Bauder, the bassist Tom Abbs and the drummer Tomas Fujiwara. At 7:30 and 9 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez SEA Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; cover, $20 a set. (Chinen)    EDDIE DANIELS's 65TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Thursday) The clarinetist Eddie Daniels will reach standard retirement age on Thursday, though he doesn't seem to have much interest in laying back. The first of his four nights at Iridium will feature numerous guests, including his fellow clarinetists Ken Peplowski, Ron Odrich and Paquito D'Rivera (who also plays alto saxophone). The house rhythm section will consist of Joe Locke on vibraphone, David Finck on bass and Joe La Barbera on drums. (Through Oct. 22.)

Tonight the trumpeters John McNeil and Ron Horton jointly present a group that also includes a third trumpeter, the festival's founder, Dave Douglas; tomorrow there will be sets led by Butch Morris and then Ted Daniel. The series finale, a benefit for music programs in New York public schools, will feature an honor roll of guests, including the composer and alto saxophonist John Zorn, the bassist Henry Grimes and the Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band.

(Chinen)    DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band -- which has a strong recent album, ''Dizzy's Business'' (Telarc) -- includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Paquito D'Rivera. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a natural choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    * JIM HALL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Jim Hall's economical style and deep harmonic command have made him a quiet hero of jazz guitar; he leads his regular trio with the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Terry Clarke. (Through Oct. 22.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.net; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    STEFON HARRIS (Wednesday) ''African Tarantella: Dances With Duke'' (Blue Note) is the sixth album by the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, and one of his strongest; it's an interpretation of music from two Duke Ellington suites, along with several original themes. As he does on the album, Mr. Harris augments his working quartet here with the trombonist Steve Turre, the clarinetist Mark Vinci, the flutist Anne Drummond, the cellist Louise Dubin and the violist Junah Chung. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Chinen)    JIMMY HEATH'S 80TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight through Sunday night) The saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath will turn 80 this month, and the Blue Note is celebrating the occasion with an engagement replete with such special guests as the trumpeter Clark Terry (tonight and tomorrow) and the saxophonist and flutist James Moody (Sunday), who have both infused their octogenarian years with youthful brio. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    RODNEY KENDRICK (Tonight) Mr. Kendrick is a commanding pianist who has gradually been returning to the spotlight after a bit of a hiatus. He appears as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattn, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20. (Chinen)    * LATIN JAZZ CONCERT USA (Thursday) A rich bonanza of Afro-Caribbean and Latin American artists, including the conga legend Candido Camero, the flutist Dave Valentin, the singer Xiomara Laugart and the guitarist and singer David Oquendo, among many others.

(Chinen)    BEN MONDER (Wednesday) ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), the most recent album by the guitarist Ben Monder, is a small-scale but ambitious suite of original music that doesn't sound quite like anything else. He will present some of the same material here, with the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Ted Poor. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    MARK MURPHY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Murphy is a singer known mainly for sly insouciance, but on his recent album ''Once to Every Heart'' (Verve), he opted for a burnished and broken romanticism. He is performing with a small group featuring the pianist Misha Piatigorsky. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with a midnight set tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    MICHAEL MUSILLAMI TRIO (Wednesday) Serpentine lyricism and angular forms are major attributes of ''Dachau,'' an album released last year by the guitarist Michael Mussillami on his own Playscape label. Joined by the bassist Joe Fonda and the drummer George Schuller, he'll revisit that recording, as well as a newer one, ''Fragile Forms,'' also on Playscape. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    TED NASH QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The saxophonist Ted Nash has proved to be a smart and resourceful bandleader, especially for ensembles like this one, which has Marcus Printup on trumpet, Frank Kimbrough on piano, Ben Allison on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (AUM Fidelity), the latest recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    AARON PARKS QUARTET (Tonight) Aaron Parks, a promising young pianist who has turned heads for the past few years in Terence Blanchard's working band, leads a quartet full of fine players: the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Rodney Green. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)    SECTION QUARTET/TRAVIS SULLIVAN'S BJORKESTRA (Thursday) Two young ensembles, each focused on repertory of a contemporary strain: the Section Quartet takes a crack at the Radiohead album ''OK Computer,'' while the Bjorkestra scores the music of Bjork for big band. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 ($20 in advance). (Chinen)    US FREE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The drummer Andrew Cyrille and the bassist Henry Grimes are members of an avant-garde jazz generation that came of age in the 1960's and 70's, while the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry is a comparably newer arrival who has earned respect in his peer group and beyond. The trio has a goofy name that will probably ring true, with collectivity and freedom high on the agenda. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)    * BEBO VALDÉS (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Valdés, a pianist, composer and august figure in the history of Cuban music, won a Grammy and a Latin Grammy last year for his superlative album ''Bebo de Cuba'' (Calle 54). The centerpiece of that album is ''Suite Cubana,'' an opus for big band; he will conduct it here with the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, a resident ensemble of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Mr. Valdés, who turned 88 this week, will also play the piano with musicians culled from the ranks of the orchestra, including some who appeared on the album.

Opera    'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of the New York City Opera's best productions. A new cast has taken over, including two singers new to the company, Inna Dukach as Mimi and Robert Gardner as Marcello. Dinyar Vania will sing Rodolfo; Dana Beth Miller is the Musetta; Kyungmook Yum is Schaunard; and Eric Jordan is Colline. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette)    'CARMEN' (Wednesday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who made his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Midgette)    'The ELIxIr of love' (Tonight, Sunday and Thursday) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elixir'' is a delightful opera, and it's decently sung by Anna Skibinsky, an Adina with a little ribbon of a voice; John Tessier, an honest, solid, if North American Nemorino; and especially Jan Opalach, who has a lot of fun and sounds very good as Dulcamara. George Manahan's conducting is not exactly Italianate. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)    'FAUST' (Monday and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. The cast includes Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. On Thursday Darina Takova takes over the role of Marguerite, and Fernando de la Mora replaces Mr. Vargas. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn)    'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) This wild and woolly exercise in hate and mayhem continues at the Metropolitan Opera, with stirring music, old-fashioned production values and a strong cast that includes Violeta Urmana, Olga Borodina and Aquiles Machado. On Wednesday Aprile Millo replaces Ms. Urmana. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Bernard Holland)    * 'IDOMENEO' (Tomorrow) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. The rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson is Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. In the crucial role of Ilia, Nicole Heaston takes the place of Dorothea Röschmann in tomorrow's performance. James Levine conducts. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini)    * 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tuesday) The abstract staging in Anthony Minghella's 0visually beautiful production deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and a life-size puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)    'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tonight and tomorrow, and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up, including a revised version of ''Thérèse Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Met. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of this frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Lehar operetta. It will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini)    'ORPHEUS' (Tonight) Next season at Glimmerglass is under the star of Orpheus, not figuratively but literally: All four operas represent different takes on the Orpheus legend, from Offenbach's irreverent satire to Philip Glass's ''Orphée.'' In a kind of preview recital tonight, excerpts from all five operas (the others are by Monteverdi, Gluck and Haydn) will join other Orpheus songs by Vaughan Williams and Schubert. Among the good young singers are the sopranos Caroline Worra and Michael Maniaci -- yes, he's a man, and he will sing the lead in the Gluck/Berlioz version. At 7:30, Morgan Library, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 590-0392, www.themorgan.org; $45; $35 for members. (Midgette)    * 'DIE TOTE STADT' (Tomorrow) Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera has revived its 1975 production of this work, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini)    'VIOLET FIRE' (Wednesday) Jon Gibson, best known as an early and steadfast member of the Philip Glass Ensemble, has created this multimedia opera about Nikola Tesla, the early-20th-century scientist and inventor who made early breakthroughs in radio broadcasting, electricity and robotics. Miriam Seidel wrote the libretto, and Terry O'Reilly (a director of the Mabou Mines theater company) directs the impressionistic staging. At 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Kozinn)    'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberflöte'' is under way at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and believable Pamina, and Nathan Gunn uses his vibrant baritone and dramatic energy to create an instantly appealing Papageno. Their charisma somewhat overshadows Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Vivien Schweitzer)    Classical Music    * AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) This orchestra opens its season with the world premieres of Michael Gantonska's ''After the Wings of Migratory Birds,'' Evan Ziporyn's ''Big Grenadilla,'' Brad Lubman's ''Fuzzy Logic'' and Corey Dargel's ''All the Notes and Rhythms I've Ever Loved.'' Also on the program are recent works by Michael Gandolfi and Susie Ibarra, and an oldie -- O.K., an American classic -- by Charles Ives. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 and $40. (Kozinn)    APOLLO'S FIRE BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Thursday) ''Bach in Context'' is the title of the Miller Theater series, and this installment contextualizes Johann Sebastian by presenting him in tandem with his friend and rival Telemann, and letting the audience judge between them. The news is the New York debut of the renowned, Cleveland-based and reportedly excellent baroque orchestra Apollo's Fire. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $15 for students. (Midgette)    CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA (Wednesday and Thursday) The estimable Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff brings his cutely named ensemble to Alice Tully Hall for two all-Mozart programs. At 8 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $56. (Holland)    * LEON FLEISHER (Thursday) After a neurological condition rendered his right hand nearly useless more than 40 years ago, the pianist Leon Fleisher, now 78, spent years performing only left-hand repertory. But thanks to new treatments, he has been making a remarkable comeback. His Carnegie Hall recital features some works from his new CD, ''Leon Fleisher: The Journey'' (Vangard Classics), including Bach's ''Capriccio on the Departure of His Most Dearly Beloved Brother'' and Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor (BWV 903) and Stravinsky's Serenade in A. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $88. (Schweitzer)    ANNE-MARIE MCDERMOTT (Thursday) Ms. McDermott, one of New York's more interesting pianists and musicians, has a go at Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. At 10:30 p.m., Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30. (Holland)    MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Sunday) A new piece by the unquenchable Elliott Carter called ''In the Distances of Sleep'' will be offered by this adventurous and accomplished offshoot of James Levine's Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. The program includes Mozart's G Minor Piano Quartet and the Mendelssohn Octet. At 5 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $58 and $68. (Holland)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Young People's Concerts may not have the high profile that Leonard Bernstein once brought to them, but they tend to be well-planned and engaging. Tomorrow Delta David Gier conducts ''The Ages of Music: Baroque,'' the first in a series of programs that will survey music history. On the regular subscription series this week the brilliant American conductor David Robertson leads works by Stravinsky and Mozart, including a violin concerto by each, with Gil Shaham as soloist. Then on Thursday Avery Fisher Hall becomes a movie palace when the dynamic young Xian Zhang conducts Prokofiev's pulsating score for Sergei Eisenstein's epic film ''Alexander Nevsky'' (1938), while that cinematic masterpiece is screened. Don't bring popcorn. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 2 (Young People's Concert) and 8 p.m., and Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96; remaining tickets for the Young People's Concert are $8 to $24. (Tommasini)    'PROMENADE CONCERT' (Tonight) The ever-inventive George Steel has assembled a program of rarities, both light and serious, in the tradition of the popular (and popularly priced) Promenades concerts. For the occasion, Mr. Steel is conducting the Vox Vocal Ensemble and the Gotham City Orchestra, with Tiffany Jackson, soprano, and Alexandra Cooke, mezzo-soprano. The program includes music by Lalo, Gounod, Chabrier, Villette, Schmitt and Messiaen. At 8, Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $10. (Kozinn)    STEVE REICH TRIBUTE (Sunday) As part of its celebration of Steve Reich's 70th birthday, the Whitney Museum has assembled a four-hour concert of his music and the works of younger composers whose music he influenced. The selections run from Mr. Reich's early phase piece ''It's Gonna Rain'' (1965), through his classic scores of the 1970's and 80's (among them ''Clapping Music,'' ''Music for Mallet Instruments, Voice and Organ'' and ''Vermont Counterpoint'') and more recent works. The performers include several superb new-music bands -- Alarm Will Sound, the Prism Saxophone Quartet, So Percussion and Tactus -- as well as the flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson, and the guitarist Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth. At 2 p.m., 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639, whitney.org; free with admission to the museum, which is $15; $10 for students and 62+.

(Schweitzer)    * PIETER WISPELWEY (Sunday) Beethoven's complete works for cello and piano have increasingly shown themselves to be a fine large-scale concert for a gifted cellist. Now taking on the corpus -- five sonatas and three sets of variations, with two intermissions -- is this Dutch cellist, whose last cycles in New York have been of the Bach suites. However, he has recorded the Beethoven, to great acclaim, with a regular recital partner who appears with him this weekend, the Croatian pianist Dejan Lazic. At 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $50. (Midgette)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Wednesday and Thursday) The company's more venturesome fall season gets under way on Wednesday with a gala and continues with regular mixed-repertory programs, from Thursday through Nov. 5.

(John Rockwell)    BETONTANC (Thursday) This Slovenian company's press materials say it is composed of ''self-described dissidents, egocentrics, pop-demons, ideologists, pragmatists, humorists, etc.'' It comes to New York as part of the European Dream Festival. The dissidents and egocentrics will take on Dostoyevsky's ''Crime and Punishment'' in ''Wrestling Dostoyevsky.'' Sounds promising. (Through Oct. 21.) At 8.30 p.m., St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15. (Roslyn Sulcas)    YANIRA CASTRO & COMPANY (Thursday) Ms. Castro's ''(fetus)twin fet(us)twin'' journeys through installations in a catacombslike performance space to explore loss, union and physical separation.

(Dunning)    COMPLEXIONS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This group, formed by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, is known for attracting superb dancers who tend to be stronger than the choreography on offer. That may not be true this time, since the troupe is presenting Ulysses Dove's rarely seen ''Dancing on the Front Porch of Heaven,'' originally choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet. Also on the program is a new work, ''Hissy Fits,'' by Mr. Rhoden, and an excerpt from his hyperactive ''Anthem.'' Tomorrow at 7.30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. (Sulcas)    * MERCE CUNNINGHAM DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The repertory includes the latest in Merce Cunningham's technological experiments.

(Rockwell)    'FOOD FOR THOUGHT' (Tonight through Sunday night) What was it Emma Goldman said about social revolutions and dance? Feed the hungry is the message of this program, whose many participants were chosen by Miguel Gutierrez (tonight), Wendy Blum (tomorrow) and Heidi Latsky (Sunday). At 8:30, Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $10; $5 with two cans of food. (Dunning)    'FRIDAYS @ NOON' (Today) Choreography by Karen Reedy and Sarah Van't Hul will be performed in this informal dance and discussion series. At noon, 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; free. (Dunning)    * GARTH FAGAN DANCE (Tuesday through Thursday) Garth Fagan's limpid, calligraphic dances will include a world premiere during this one-week run at the Joyce. Among other pieces from Mr. Fagan's repertory is last year's very briefly seen ''Life: Dark/Light,'' to the jazz violinist Billy Bang's ''Vietnam: The Aftermath.'' (Through Oct. 22.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $42. (Sulcas)    HENNING RUBSAM'S SENSEDANCE (Thursday) A new work, ''Merciless Beauty,'' from the German-born, New York City-based Mr. Rubsam, who works mostly in a balletic idiom but also draws from the worlds of jazz and social dance. His work can be uneven but almost always holds rewards. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 p.m., Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $25; artists and students, $15. (Sulcas)    * SYLVIE GUILLEM AND RUSSELL MALIPHANT (Tonight through Sunday) This star French ballerina, now segueing into modern dance, joins forces with the British dancer and choreographer Russell Maliphant for a four-part program called ''Push,'' the first result of the newly announced collaboration between City Center and the Sadler's Wells Theater in London. There will be two Guillem solos, one Maliphant solo and a duet. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $35 to $85. (Rockwell)    RENNIE HARRIS (Tonight) Mr. Harris blends hip-hop poetry, rap music and movement and traditional African dance in ''Prince ScareKrow's Road to the Emerald City.'' A preview of the work is part of the Impact Festival, which focuses on human rights, social justice and political activism. At 8, Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 253-7017, theatermania.com; $15 to $35. (Dunning)    ANNABELLA LENZA AND DAMAN HARUN (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Lenza will present a new work that deconstructs the ritual of the Roman Catholic Mass, and Mr. Harun will explore spirituality and religion in another new piece. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning)    * SARAH MICHELSON (Wednesday and Thursday) This star of downtown experimental modern dance gets her big Next Wave festival break with four performances of a piece called ''Dogs,'' commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and designed for its Harvey Theater space. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Rockwell)    MOLLIE O'BRIEN/MOB PRODUCTIONS (Thursday) Ms. O'Brien's quartet, ''Mammal,'' explores how aggression and force relate to intimacy and connection. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning)    'PEAK PERFORMANCES' (Thursday) This series aims to provoke, and its choice, Jan Fabre, is said to be a first-rate provocateur. His new ''Quando l'uomo principale e una donna'' (''When the Leading Man Turns Out to Be a Woman'') is an homage to Yves Klein, who used nude women as paintbrushes. Mr. Fabre takes things further by coating the stage floor with olive oil. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, Normal Avenue, Montclair, (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $35. (Dunning)    STEPHEN PETRONIO AND RACOCO PRODUCTIONS (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mr. Petronio and his quicksilver choreography company are featured tomorrow in the Dance at the Winter Garden series.

Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 12:30 p.m., World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, stephenpetronio.com, racoco.org; free. (Dunning)    SPRINGDANCE DIALOGUE (Tonight and tomorrow night) The American component of this international festival based in the Netherlands ends with work by Myriam Gourfink and Nami Yamamoto tonight and Kristyna Lhotakova, Tatiana Gordeeva and Levi Gonzalez tomorrow.

At 8 p.m., Morocco's Academy of Middle Eastern Dance, 6 West 20th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'A DEAF ARTIST IN EARLY AMERICA: THE WORLDS OF JOHN BREWSTER JR.,' through Jan. 7. Few early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Brewster was born deaf before remedial help or a common signing language existed. The case the show makes for Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)     * ASIA SOCIETY: 'GILDED SPLENDOR: TREASURES OF CHINA'S LIAO EMPIRE (907-1125),' through Dec. 31. For a thousand years the Khitan, who established the Liao Empire, were dismissed by Chinese historians, but they have been redeemed by late-20th-century archaeological discoveries. The evidence is laid out in this show of more than 200 objects excavated from tombs, temples and walled cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. The first major display of Liao objects outside China, the show gives the lie to the Khitan as cultural nobodies. .Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Grace Glueck)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING,' through Dec. 31. Weighing in at six works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Roberta Smith)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'BRUSH AND INK: THE CHINESE ART OF WRITING,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    * THE MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Glueck)      * NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)     RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)     * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: MARK GROTJAHN, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)    THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Chelsea     DONA NELSON The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter)    DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith)    Last Chance     BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE'  Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu; closes on Sunday. (Smith)    * GERALD DAVIS Growing up can be hell, especially if you're an art-loving sissy. This is more or less the story told by Mr. Davis's auspicious New York solo debut. The show is titled ''1986,'' for the year the artist entered his teens, and in several polished autobiographical drawings it illustrates a state of social and psychological crisis already in progress. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    ALICE KÖNTIZ Ambiguity is the thread in this compact show. Its various small sculptures do double duty as furniture, specifically as supports for other art. Formally, each piece looks at once designer-chic and job lot cheap. The gallery installation could be either a showroom or a living room. Or both, which is the point. Hudson Franklin, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1189; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    ADAM MCEWEN Most of the more interesting artists these days work in several media and tend to approach ideas at a slant. The British-born Adam McEwen qualifies on both counts in a solo show of abstract paintings made with chewing gum and photographs of an apartment complex in Queens. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    TAYLOR MCKIMENS: 'THE DRIPS' In his second show this artist continues to make highly effective full-scale figures and installations that seem to have escaped from a comic book, which they have. His vision of down-and-out America has intensified and is now dominated by oozing, hairy, often faceless blobs called the Drips. Clementine, 623 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-5937; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    WALLPAPER LAB In this show 15 artists (including Douglas Gordon, Gary Simmons, Fred Tomaselli and Phoebe Washburn) adapt their art to the wallpaper format. The results vary tremendously, but it is always interesting to see how artistic ideas translate from one medium to another. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 941-0012; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    AARON YOUNG Before the opening of this show, Mr. Young hired a biker to rev up in the gallery and lay down DeKooningesque tracks of burnt rubber. He also installed painted bronze casts of street curbing and invited skateboarders to perform on them until some of the paint wore off and the gold-colored metal came through. Four ''trick,'' audience-participation paintings hang in the back gallery. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari and Katharina Fritsch, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org; closes on Monday.

Cynthia Nixon takes on the juicy title role made famous by illustrious actresses like Zoe Caldwell, Vanessa Redgrave and Maggie Smith (in the film version) in the New Group's revival of Jay Presson Allen's adaptation of Muriel Spark's novel about a passionate teacher in a conservative Scottish school (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.    'SOUTHERN COMFORTS' In previews; opens on Oct. 18. Judith Ivey directs this drama about a widow and a widower who meet late in life. Presented by Primary Stages (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.    'TALE OF 2CITIES' Opens on Thursday. Heather Woodbury's sweeping two-part, six-hour epic about urban displacement -- which features an ensemble cast -- was inspired by the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles (6:00). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101.    'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' In previews; opens on Oct. 26. Bob Dylan has come back in vogue just in time for his Broadway show, staged by Twyla Tharp (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100.    'TRUTH $(the heart is a million little pieces above all things$)' The master storyteller Mike Daisey addresses J. T. LeRoy, James Frey and his own history with lying (1:40). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444.    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' In previews; opens on Thursday. Judy Gold gives the Jewish mother's point of view in this solo show, which returns for an open-ended run (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.    'THE VOYAGE OF THE CARCASS' In previews; opens on Oct. 16. Dan Fogler (''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'') plays one of the three surviving members of the SS Carcass. Or is he just an actor in a play within a play (2:30)? SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515.    'WRECKS' In previews; opens on Tuesday. Neil LaBute is back at it with a new play -- a solo -- about love, marriage and other sources of pain. The movie star this time is Ed Harris (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555.    Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime ''Soap'' star, gives a pocket history of the craft in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings '''My Way,''' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. ( Zinoman)    'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH'  A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). HERE Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)    'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)    'wasps in bed' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ALLENDE: THE DEATH OF A PRESIDENT'  A dry history lesson about the final hours of Salvador Allende, the Marxist president of Chile who died in 1973 during a military coup (1:15). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger)    'OFF-STAGE: THE WEST VILLAGE FRAGMENTS' A warm-hearted and well-researched mix of walking tour and performance that offers a sampling menu of excerpts from plays from the origins of Off Off Broadway (2:00). Various locations throughout Greenwich Village, (212) 529-3626; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)    * 'SEVEN GUITARS' Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closes tomorrow. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott)    'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)    'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julián Hernández's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee)    'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee)    'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)    * '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott)    'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee)    'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)    * 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)    'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott)    'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis)    'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)    * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Stephen Holden)    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)    'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)    * 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee)    'jet li's FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee)    'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)    'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)    'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern)    * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)    'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis)    * 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott)    * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)    * 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)    'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott)    Film Series    J'AIME LE CINÉMA AMÉRICAIN: AGNÈS B SELECTS (Through Wednesday) The French fashion designer Agnès B. reveals a taste for unusual American movies in a weeklong series of screenings sponsored by BAMcinématek. The program, which began on Monday, continues this weekend with Tod Browning's ''Freaks'' (1932), David Lynch's ''Lost Highway'' (1996) and John Waters's ''Pink Flamingos'' (1972). Those three treat audiences to the stories of homicidal circus sideshow performers, a musician who turns into a mechanic and a transvestite competing with everything she's got in a Filthiest People Alive contest. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10.

(Chinen)    * BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday night) Branford Marsalis leads one of the most athletic working bands in the jazz mainstream, a point of pride he playfully acknowledges with the locker-room photograph on the cover of his new album, ''Braggtown'' (Marsalis Music). The ensemble -- with Joey Calderazzo on piano, Eric Revis on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums -- doesn't work often in clubs, which makes this engagement all the more significant. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $35. (Chinen)    * BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) The pianist Brad Mehldau recently renovated the sound of his longstanding trio, with help from the powerfully expressive drummer Jeff Ballard. The group's luminous brand of lyricism has survived, but its repertory is slightly more pop-oriented, and its rhythmic tumble more pronounced. (Through Oct. 15.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    PETE ROBBINS (Sunday) The choral music of the Italian Renaissance composer Carlo Gesualdo has recently provided inspiration for the creative energies of Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist. His ''Gesualdo Adaptations'' feature a modernistic ensemble of two saxophonists, two guitarists and an electric keyboard, along with bass and drums. At 8 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, bar4.net; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen)    * KURT ROSENWINKEL QUINTET (Tonight through Sunday night) Kurt Rosenwinkel's electric guitar has an airy tone that offsets the cerebral twinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. The two musicians are backed by Aaron Parks on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Jeff Ballard on drums. At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    MATT WILSON QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Wilson, a mischievous and nimble drummer, leads a rugged quartet with the trumpeter Jon Sneider, the saxophonist Jeff Lederer and the bassist Martin Wind. At 10, Detour, 349 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 533-6212; cover, $5. (Chinen)    * A TRIBUTE TO RAY BARRETTO (Tomorrow) This salute to the conga player Ray Barretto, who died this year, features a version of his orchestra, with guests including the singers Adalberto Santiago, Tito Allen and Ray De La Paz; the percussionist Giovanni Hidalgo; the bassist Andy Gonzalez; the pianist Oscar Hernandez, who doubles as musical director; and the tenor saxophonist Chris Barretto, who follows in his father's footsteps as a jazz musician. Also on hand is the Machito Orchestra, led by Mario Grillo. At 8 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $35 to $45. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, the New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who was too nervous to be judged at his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla who seems to belong to a world apart from this rather pedestrian production. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Anne Midgette)    'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The director Jonathan Miller updates Donizetti's lively comic opera from a rustic Italian setting to a 1950's American diner in this New York City Opera production. The cast includes Anna Skibinsky as Adina, and Erin Morley as Giannetta (both making their company debuts), John Tessier as Nemorino, Paulo Szot as Belcore and Jan Opalach as Dulcamara. George Manahan conducts the New York City Opera orchestra in Donizetti's tuneful score. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Vivien Schweitzer)    'FAUST' (Tonight and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. In the cast: Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. Tonight at 8 and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Allan Kozinn)    'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow) Grand opera does not get much grander or more theatrical or more violent than this. The traditional production by the Metropolitan Opera stars Violeta Urmana and Olga Borodina, with Marcello Giordani taking over as Enzo. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; metopera.org; $42 to $375. (Bernard Holland)    * 'IDOMENEO'  (Tuesday) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' staged by the Metropolitan Opera. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. Other standouts in the cast include the exquisite soprano Dorothea Röschmann as the captured princess Ilia and the rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson as Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. James Levine conducts a refined account of a work he clearly loves. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's elegantly stylized 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $275. (Anthony Tommasini)    'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tonight through Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its charmingly tiny quarters on the Bowery. This weekend it continues its run of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' with a rotating cast. The quality varies and depends largely on who is singing that night, but the spirit is often there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)    'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up for this season, including a revised version of ''Thérèse Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Metropolitan Opera. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of the frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Franz Lehár operetta ''The Merry Widow.'' The production will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini)    'DIE TOTE STADT' (Sunday) The composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at the age of 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera, which has been a champion of this neglected work, has revived its 1975 production, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)    'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Tomorrow and Monday) Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's fairytale opera ''Die Zauberflöte,'' introduced in 2004, did not please everyone, including this critic. But overall it was an enormous hit with Met audiences. To me the production was so packed with nonstop stage effects, so overly busy and so peopled with dancers, extras, gargantuan puppets and kitelike animals of every sort that the fine musical performances by the conductor James Levine and cast took a back seat to the stage show. The conductor Scott Bergeson takes the podium for the Met's current revival. The promising cast includes Isabel Bayrakdarian as Pamina, Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino and Nathan Gunn as Papageno. Tomorrow at 1:30 and Monday at 7:30, the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Tommasini)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and its programs are growing more varied all the time. Tonight Katya Mihailova, a pianist; William Harvey, a violinist; and Chris Gross, a cellist, play piano trios by Haydn, Dvorak and Adolphus Hailstork. Tomorrow and Sunday another ensemble -- Naoko Tanaka, a violinist; Masao Kawasaki, a violist; Joseph Lee, a cellist; and Rita Sloan, a pianist -- play Mozart's Piano Quartet No. 1 (K. 478) and works for violin and piano by Mozart and Shostakovich. And on Thursday the pianist Hamish Milne plays Bach's Partita No. 4, Beethoven's Sonata in E (Op. 109) and works by Medtner and Chopin. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday at 4.

(Kozinn)    BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) To start its Carnegie Hall appearances in James Levine's third season as music director, the orchestra is performing the Viennese Schools, first and second, in two piano concertos, one by Beethoven (the fourth), one by Schoenberg. Both feature as soloist another conductor with a wide and ambitious range, Daniel Barenboim. Also on the program is the string-orchestra version of Schoenberg's ''Verklärte Nacht.'' At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $127. (Midgette)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Thursday) If you think that the Chamber Music Society's usual home, Alice Tully Hall, is too big for this intimate repertory, here's a chance to hear the ensemble in closer confines. Stephen Taylor, the oboist; Jose Franch-Ballester, the clarinetist; Peter Kolkay, the bassoonist; Stewart Rose, the hornist; and Inon Barnatan, the pianist, recombine in various configurations to play the Francaix Divertissement, the Poulenc Trio and Beethoven's Quintet in E flat for Winds and Piano (Op. 16). At 6:45, the Rose Studio, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; sold out. (Kozinn)    * VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Tuesday and Thursday) In a surprising shift from his modern piano comfort zone, this thoughtful artist is performing all of Mozart's piano sonatas on a modern copy of a Mozart-era Walter fortepiano. The five recitals are split between the New School and the Mannes College of Music. In the final two installments, Mr. Feltsman will play the Sonatas in F (K. 533), C (K. 545) and C minor (K. 457), and the Fantasia in C minor (K. 475), on Tuesday at Mannes; he will perform the Sonatas in B flat (K. 570) and D (K. 576), as well as the Fantasia in D minor (K. 385), the Rondo in D (K. 485) and the Adagio in B minor (K. 540) on Thursday at the New School.

James DePriest, Juilliard's director of conducting and orchestral studies, leads the program.

(Schweitzer)    LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The orchestra's Beethoven cycle with Bernard Haitink begins with the Second and Third Symphonies and will continue through the week. If recordings are an indication, these should be honest, sturdy and ultimately winning performances. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $85. (Holland)    LEON MCCAWLEY (Sunday) This British pianist is active across Europe, but has not yet been heard in recital in New York. He will perform a few signature pieces, including a suite by Hans Gál, an émigré Austrian composer whose complete piano works Mr. McCawley has recorded, and the K. 311 sonata by Mozart. (A complete sonata cycle is due out soon.) The program also includes Schubert's D. 537 sonata and some pieces by Rachmaninoff.

The lineup also includes the soprano Jessica Jones, the mezzo-sopranos Isabel Leonard and Kelley O'Connor, the baritone Ian Greenlaw, the tenor Philippe Castagner (all making their Philharmonic debuts) and the bass Kevin Deas. The second half of the program features Saint-Saëns's Symphony No. 3, ''Organ.'' The Philharmonic's organist, Kent Tritle, is the soloist. At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org; $28 to $94. (Schweitzer)    * ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S (Thursday) The Bach specialist Mary Dalton Greer conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the New York Baroque Soloists in ''Bach Dialogues for Soprano and Bass,'' the first of three programs in the ''Cantatas in Context'' series, now in its seventh season. Dominique Labelle, a soprano, and Christopheren Nomura, a baritone, will sing Bach's ''Liebster Jesu, mein Verlangen'' (BWV 32), ''Ich geh und suche mit Verlangen'' (BWV 49) and ''Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid'' (BWV 58).

At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $100. (Holland)    DOROTHEA RÖSCHMANN/GRAHAM JOHNSON (Thursday) In recital, American singers tend to want to show their versatility (''Look, Ma, I can sing in five languages!'') This fine German soprano is, by contrast, sticking to her home language with an all-Viennese program. She strays afield only with some of Schubert's Scottish songs -- including all three of ''Ellen's Gesänge,'' one of which is better known as ''Ave Maria.'' The program also includes a set of Mahler and Berg's ''Sieben frühe Lieder.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $42.

Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Roberta Smith)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Jan 7. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter)    International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    * the MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Paint disports in the tiny crevices between the bars to give an effect of luminosity. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    * the MET: SET IN STONE: THE FACE IN MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE, through Feb. 19. One of those revelatory close-ups at which the Metropolitan Museum of Art excels, this show brings together nearly 80 carved, mostly limestone heads, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries, mostly torn during bouts of iconoclasm from the sculptures and reliefs that turned Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches into Bibles in stone. The treatments of hair and beard with which medieval sculptors were more at ease than they were with, say, eyes or smiles, are almost a show within a show, as, in their own way, are the haunting, seemingly modernist works that look like nothing else here. (See above) . (Smith)    RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: Mark Grotjahn, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)    The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Notwithstanding the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Chelsea    Ken Gonzales-Day In the process of researching a book called ''Lynching in the West: 1850-1935,'' this Los Angeles artist assembled an archive and made a discovery: in the more than 350 California lynchings he found records for, most of the victims were Latinos. His photographic show at Cue Foundation is an interpretive response to this fact, largely through altered historical photographs, in which the hanged figure is erased, and the spectators left intact. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, cueartfoundation.org, through Oct. 14. (Cotter)    Dona Nelson The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter)    * RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this young Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith)    DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith)    * SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented young artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size but also reveals it to be a Pandora's box of ideas. Max Ernst, Paul Outerbridge, Karen Kilimnik and Carol Bove are among the ghosts in these diminutive machines, which nonetheless run on their own steam. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 14. (Smith)    Last Chance    Guillermina Baiguera and Julian Gatto This gallery has changed its location but not its smallness, which is important to its craft-based, private-feeling, nostalgic-utopian aesthetic. The work of Guillermina Baiguera and Julian Gatto, from little watercolors to hand-size embroideries, exemplifies it. Little Cakes, Little Gallery, 625 East Sixth Street, Apartment 1B, East Village, littlecakes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    'The Filipino Roots of Minimalism: Leo Valledor and Mario Yrisarry' We owe Mitchell Algus for yet another historical rescue with this show of two painters who had a strong New York moment decades ago, then disappeared. Based on what's here, their shared Filipino background was less important to their interesting, and unalike art than the fact that they were both born in the 1930's, were abstract painters in the city in the 1960's, and exhibited at the Park Place gallery, along with Sol Lewitt, Edwin Ruda, Robert Smithson and Mark di Suvero. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Suite 206, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    * DANIEL LEFCOURT Against most odds, these beautifully made paintinglike configurations of strips of medium-density fiberboard painted black transcend their resemblance to the Minimalist get-me-out-of-painting paintings of the late 1960's. Their variety and needle-thin incised lines add layers of ideas about measurement, drawing and space, both real and illusionistic. They land squarely in the present, where abstraction is neither a dead horse nor a sacred quest, because they are primarily about looking. Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3540; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    'Mapquest' Elena Sorokina organized this group show for the activist art Web site artwurl.org. Most of what's in the gallery, by individual artists and collectives, is graphics-oriented, information-intensive and, in the current ''interventionist'' way, obliquely polemical. The show continues on artwurl.org itself. Performance Space 122 Gallery, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 228-4249; closes on Monday. (Cotter)    NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer  . Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous, Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org, closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)    SARAH OPPENHEIMER: 554-5251 In the latest labor-intensive, wall-piercing installation to treat the gallery space as a malleable object, portions of the white cube have been sliced open and seemingly formed into two enormous tubes. Part tunnel, part basket and mostly plywood, these cut through the space, revealing the storage area and windows normally hidden from view, and requiring some walking in a crouched position. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1077, ppowgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde -- collagists, collaborators and co-founders of the Booklyn Artists Alliance -- may or may not make money from their art, but for sure they make their art from money. Mr. Wagner works with green-and-white United States currency, Mr. Wilde with a rainbow of international tender. From tiny pieces of both they assemble intensely detailed pictures of staggering virtuosity, with Mr. Wilde specializing in cut-and-paste remakes of Goya's ''Disasters of War.'' Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7490, pavelzoubok.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    ANDY WARHOL: MAO Whoever added the colors and brushwork to Andy Warhol's silkscreen images of the chairman, now 30 years dead, seems to have been having a good time. The surfaces have more life than usual for the master of art-as-business production, even if the show lacks one of Warhol's really, really big Maos. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    ALEXI WORTH: COUPLES A prominent bald head, somewhere between a boxed-in apple by Magritte and the smooth pate of a de Chirico mannequin, dominates several of these quirky paintings, which are as notable for the weirdness ascribed to both representation and human relations as for the discreet formalism of space, scale, tone and surface. D C Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-2111; closes tomorrow.
