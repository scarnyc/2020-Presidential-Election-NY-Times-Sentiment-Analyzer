This little-musical-that-could about an unscrupulous Broadway producer in the 1920's (some things never change) began at the Toronto Fringe Festival and now makes its unlikely premiere on the Great White Way (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.    'FAITH HEALER' Opens May 4.

David Henry Hwang wrote the book (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100.    Broadway    * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THREE DAYS OF RAIN'  (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who re-tailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)    'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'GUARDIANS'  Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY'  This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Góes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SHOW PEOPLE'  Paul Weitz's eyebrow-pencil-thin comedy about a man who hires actors to impersonate his family feels like one long, occasionally amusing party game whose players don't know when to call it a night. The excellent four-member cast, led by Debra Monk and directed by Peter Askin, finds charm and energy amid the vaporous bait-and-switch plot reversals (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood)    * 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)    'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'CHAMPION' and 'THE STUTTERING PREACHER'  Two new one-act plays, one a well-drawn family drama and the other a brash and ribald romantic comedy, from the New Federal Theater and Black Spectrum Theater. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Hunka)    'LITTLE WILLY' A slickly produced and paper-thin character study of Hitler's nephew, who moved to Long Island before World War II (1:05). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB'  David Calvitto is fun and scary as a television game-show host who turns sadistic, and Nancy Walsh and Bill Coelius are suitably airheaded as his contestants, but the play, by C. J. Hopkins, feels like a familiar comic skit that takes aim at an easy target (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'FAHRENHEIT 451'  A visceral version of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, staged by the Godlight Theater Company. No, firefighters don't burn books these days, but still you end up saying, ''Dang, that man had vision'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'MEN OF CLAY' In a play that Jeff Cohen, the author, says is based on his father, four Jewish men gather to play tennis in early-1970's Baltimore and watch their way of life disappear. The play seems to want to generate nostalgia, but since these four are racist, sexist pigs, it's hard to wish them anything but ill (2:15). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 268-4444; closing Sunday.(Genzlinger)    'ON THE LINE' In a theater culture that is more likely to produce a play set in a well-heeled living room than on a factory floor, Joe Roland's unflinching portrait of a strike in New Jersey is a refreshing anomaly (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    'THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE MASTER RACE' Bertolt Brecht's middle-period classic in a robust new translation by Binyamin Shalom and a spare and powerful production by the Roust Theater Company, directed by James Phillip Gates (2:45). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by clichés and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger)    'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (A. O. Scott)    * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens)    'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Stevens)    * 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Stephen Holden)    * 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)    'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)    * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)    'KINKY BOOTS' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In this silly, quasi-inspirational British comedy, a staid shoe factory in Northern England avoids ruin by switching from the manufacture of men's dress shoes to that of thigh-high, stiletto-heeled boots worn by drag queens. The recipe for this feel-good movie, which cries out to be made into a musical, comes from the same cookbook that gave us ''The Full Monty.'' (Holden)    'LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO' (R, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Zoë (Bárbara Mori) is a gorgeous, vapid wife who longs for children, but her distant spouse (Christian Meier) makes love only on Saturdays. Enter the rebellious brother-in-law (Manolo Cardona), a smoldering artist whose schedule is less regimented. Bubbling with incest, adultery, religion and homosexuality, ''La Mujer de Mi Hermano'' is an overheated telenovela that considers procreation more important than honesty, and what we want more important than who we are. (Catsoulis)    * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)    'LOOK BOTH WAYS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Written and directed by the Australian animator Sarah Watt, ''Look Both Ways'' follows a group of disparate and desperate characters over the course of one of the most depressing weekends in movie history. The principal sufferers are Meryl (Justine Clarke), a morbid illustrator, and Nick (William McInnes), a terminally ill photographer, who discover that a mutual fixation on catastrophe can be quite the aphrodisiac. Bogged down by stylistic gimmickry, ''Look Both Ways'' aims for existential drama but succeeds only in reminding us that misery loves company. (Catsoulis)    'LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN' (R, 110 minutes) This star-studded jigsaw puzzle of revenge and mistaken identity thinks that it's terribly smart, although it amounts to an empty, self-satisfied imitation of ''Pulp Fiction'' that reputable actors like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley can't salvage. (Holden)    * 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)    'ON A CLEAR DAY' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Set in and around the dockyards of Glasgow, ''On a Clear Day'' follows Frank (the great Peter Mullan), a laid-off shipbuilder who decides to fix his life by swimming the English Channel. Despite a familiar crop of lovable eccentrics and a predictably inspirational thrust, the movie balances the sentimentality with excellent performances and a healthy dose of working-class vulnerability.(Catsoulis)    'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Nathan Lee)    'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee)    'SISTERS IN LAW' (No rating, 106 minutes, in English and pidgin) Grass-roots feminism thrives in a Cameroon village, thanks to the pair of warmhearted, tough-minded women of law profiled in this excellent verité documentary. (Lee)    * 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)    'TAKE THE LEAD' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Hip-hop and ballroom dancing styles fuse in a South Bronx high school at which a dance teacher, Antonio Banderas, turns gawky ducklings into gliding swans. It's sloppy but mildly endearing. (Holden)    'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)     'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)     'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)    'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)    Film Series    COMEDY FORTNIGHT (Through Wednesday) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater's festival offers nightly screenings of ''Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story,'' starring Rob Corddry of ''The Daily Show'' as a disgraced paintball champion, and two more ''Best of First Sundays: A Hilarious Retrospective'' programs of film shorts.

THE WATER (Through Tuesday) BAMcinématek concludes its tribute to Winters, who died in January at 83, with ''The Poseidon Adventure'' (1972).

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    THE ATARIS (Tuesday) The Ataris play pop-punk at its most suburban and apple-cheeked. They have been around since 1997, but their concerns haven't evolved much beyond those of the harmless skateboard rats next door. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Laura Sinagra)    JOE BATAAN (Tonight) Since the 1970's, this keyboardist has been playing Latin soul that mixes mambo and jazzy R & B. 9, BAMcafé, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; no cover. (Sinagra)    DAN BERN, KAKI KING (Tomorrow) Dan Bern is a wry singer-songwriter. Like Loudon Wainwright III, he puts his bitterness in the foreground, usually in the service of a pointed joke with a lefty edge. Kaki King is a multifaceted guitarist whose style is grounded in driving yet intricate rhythms. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)    BLACK EYED PEAS, FLIPSYDE, PUSSYCAT DOLLS (Tonight) The Black Eyed Peas make lightweight hip-hop that revolves around the brash sexiness of the singer Fergie. Flipsyde is a socially conscious rap crew that incorporates some alt-rock. The Pussycat Dolls, a burlesque crew turned hit dance-pop act, make enticingly sassy boasts about their man-stealing skills. 7:30, Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $54.50. (Sinagra)    MARSHALL CHAPMAN, JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight) The songwriter Marshall Chapman has been at it since 1973, and her songs, from ''Betty's Bein' Bad'' to ''Last Mango in Paris'' have been recorded by the likes of Crystal Gayle and Jimmy Buffet. The violinist Jenny Scheinman leads a combo with the guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist and guitarist Tony Scherr. 7:30, Housing Works Used Book Cafe, 126 Crosby Street, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3324; $20. (Sinagra)    CHIMAIRA, GOD FORBID (Wednesday) The hard-core metal band Chimaira mixes macabre themes with Greek mythology. God Forbid offers waves of apocalyptic thrash. 6 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 777-6800 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20.

Doors open at 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, $25. (Sinagra)    ELECTRIC SIX (Tuesday and Wednesday) Three years ago this Detroit garage band generated buzz with the smirking but rocking song ''Danger! High Voltage.'' Its latest album, ''Señor Smoke'' (Warner), never achieves dance-punk command, but the histrionic singer Dick Valentine and his boys know how to be manic. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $10. (Sinagra)    BANNING EYRE WITH COUMBA SIDIBÉ (Tomorrow) The playing of the guitarist, author and African-music scholar Banning Eyre takes its cues from the fluid, nimble style of the West African guitarists who populate his CD ''In Griot Time.'' Tomorrow he will be joined by the deep-voiced Malian singer Coumba Sidibé and will play as part of her backing combo. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $10. (Sinagra)    BELA FLECK & THE FLECKTONES (Tonight) Bela Fleck, a banjoist, has moved far beyond bluegrass technique. His own tunes feature odd meters and tricky structures, though his band can make them sound briskly mechanical. He has also applied his technique to the classical repertory for one more kind of crossover. 11:30, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Jon Pareles)    KIRK FRANKLIN (Tomorrow) Kirk Franklin is a preacher, not a singer, but that hasn't kept him from selling millions of albums. He leads a troupe that meshes P-Funk grooves with messages of uplift, putting hip-hop rhythms behind the old-fashioned gospel dynamics of wide-open belting and jubilant choir singing, updating the music without sacrificing it to slickness. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $37 to $65. (Pareles)    GHAZAL (Tuesday) Kayhan Kalhor, who plays a spike fiddle, and Shujaat Husain Khan, who plays sitar, weave classical Persian and Indian styles into improvisatory jams.

(Sinagra)    GHOSTFACE KILLAH, DJ PREMIER, SLICK RICK (Tomorrow) There is lots of rapping lately about drugs and dealing, but the Wu Tang Clan alum Ghostface Killah brings a particular pathos to the rap game on his new ''Fishscale'' (Def Jam), cutting pure thrill with whiffs of regret. He is joined on the bill by the jazzy DJ Premier and the smooth storyteller Slick Rick. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $33. (Sinagra)    GUSTER (Tonight) Guster, a band from Boston, has followed the Dave Matthews Band's playbook for building an audience: touring constantly and singing unabashedly earnest folk-rock songs about the painful uncertainties of friendship, love and growing up. 7, Hiro Ballroom, 366 West 17th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Pareles)    SEU JORGE (Thursday) This Brazilian singer may be best known here for his lilting samba covers of David Bowie songs in the movie ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou'' and his role as Knockout Ned in ''City of God.'' His music avoids the traditional Brazilian styles, favoring crowd-pleasing funk-pop and loverman R & B. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan; (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra)    HUGH MASEKELA (Tuesday) The South African flugelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)    VAN MORRISON (Monday) Van Morrison has flirted with country music before, but his latest album, ''Pay the Devil'' (Lost Highway), offers his slanted take on songs like Hank Williams's ''Your Cheatin' Heart'' and Rodney Crowell's ''Till I Gain Control Again.'' He's better at his own classic, agitated R & B but can certainly work up a surly-cowboy pique. 7:30 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 3 (212) 307-7171; $79.50 and $149.50.(Sinagra)    NOUVELLE VAGUE (Tonight) These French multi-instrumentalists have hit upon a lucrative shtick, covering jittery post-punk gems like Joy Division's dark, swirling ''Love Will Tear Us Apart'' as bossa nova chill-out music. 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sinagra)    SCISSOR SISTERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) These performance-artist glam rockers have both a healthy sense of irony and pop chops. Their exuberant ''Take Your Mama Out'' gained them a mainstream following. Tomorrow at 10 p.m., Sunday at 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)    SECRET MACHINES (Wednesday) This psych-rock act harks back to both Led Zeppelin-style pummel and the ragtag explorations of the Flaming Lips, prizing epic live sound as much as headphone spaciousness. 9 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)    SUPERSUCKERS (Thursday) The Supersuckers play amiable Satanist speed-metal patterned on Motorhead's ''Ace of Spades.'' 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 777-6800 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50.

(Sinagra)    TOOTS & THE MAYTALS (Tonight) Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand-new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $27.50.

But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; cover, $60, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow.

(Holden)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs.

(Holden)    BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)    * MARY CLEERE HARAN  (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) A wonderful no-frills singer with a sophisticated wit, Ms. Haran has a remarkable talent for simultaneously interpreting standards in the spirit in which they were written and looking at them through 21st-century eyes. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $60 tonight and tomorrow; $50 Tuesday through Thursday.

A similar time warp occurs every time the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra performs Chico O'Farrill's ''Afro-Cuban Suite,'' as it plans to do here. 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $130.

(Chinen)    JOÃO BOSCO (Tuesday through April 30) Known in his early career as a hit-making songwriter for the Brazilian songbird Elis Regina, Mr. Bosco has been a popular singer on his own merits for some 20 years.

(Chinen)    RON CARTER /KARRIN ALLYSON (Through Sunday) Mr. Carter, an august and influential bassist, has had mixed success as a bandleader; his best efforts usually involve the articulate pianist Stephen Scott, who joins him in this quartet. Ms. Allyson comes bearing a new album, ''Footprints'' (Concord), which delves into Jon Hendricks-style vocalese; as on the album, she digs in here with a strong ensemble spearheaded by the pianist Bruce Barth. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    GEORGE COLEMAN QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Fluent and fiery hard bop, from a well-traveled saxophonist and a rhythm section that includes the sharp pianist Anthony Wonsey and the hard-driving drummer Louis Hayes. 8, 10 and 11:30 p..m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $30. (Chinen)    FREESTYLE JAZZ (Thursday) The avant-garde series formerly established at CBGB's Lounge now takes place every Thursday in a cozy side room adjoining an unassuming pub. This week's program offers three texture-minded trios, led by the trombonist Joe Fiedler, the trumpeter Roy Campbell Jr. and the multireedist Andrew Lamb. 8 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    BILL FRISELL QUINTET (Through Sunday, and Tuesday through April 30) On his latest Nonesuch releases -- ''East/West'' and ''Further East/Further West,'' both partly recorded at the Village Vanguard -- the guitarist Bill Frisell conjures a compelling hallucination of the American popular songbook, with Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen on bass and drums. The addition of the saxophonist Greg Tardy and the trumpeter Ron Miles alters the ensemble's chemistry as well as its size. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 on Fridays and Saturdays; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    MONCEF GENOUD (Tonight) Tunisian-born, Swiss-raised and blind from birth, Mr. Genoud applies an uncommon perspective to his acoustic piano playing, as he demonstrates on a strong new album, ''Aqua'' (Savoy). He performs here with a trio, his most comfortable setting. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    ROBIN HOLCOMB (Tomorrow) Ms. Holcomb seeks out meditative spaces as both a pianist and a singer, and she softens her experimental urges with an enveloping sort of lyricism. For this rare unaccompanied performance, she revisits old pieces and introduces some new ones. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen)    DAVE KIKOSKI QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) A well-rounded pianist in the modern mainstream, Mr. Kikoski often does his best work as an accompanist, which is only one reason to applaud this group's inclusion of the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    PAT MARTINO QUINTET (Through Sunday) The guitarist Pat Martino's new Blue Note album, ''Remember: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery,'' does exactly what it purports to do. And it works, because of the untroubled self-assurance of the emulation and the simple satisfaction of a hard-swinging band. 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    RENÉ McLEAN (Tonight) Mr. McLean, a saxophonist, leads an acoustic quartet in memory of his father, the alto saxophone legend Jackie McLean, who died three weeks ago. 7, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen)    MYRA MELFORD (Tonight) Ms. Melford's solo piano playing is a study in subtle coloration and shifting grain, but it can also deliver the solid punch of the blues. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen)    FRANK MORGAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) Now in his 70's, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan is one of the last survivors of the bebop era (and in his case, survivor is truly the appropriate term). He leads a sympathetic group consisting of John Hicks on piano, Curtis Lundy on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    MY EARS ARE BENT (Tuesday) This three-piece band, consisting of Ted Reichman on acoustic piano and electronics, Mary Halvorson on guitar and Ben Perowsky on drums, fashions an engrossingly layered chamber-music aesthetic that suggests more than a passing interest in independent rock. 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (Aum Fidelity), the new recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one of them, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight and Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. Tonight she plays and sings in a group featuring Bill Frisell and Tony Scherr on guitars, and Peter Scherr on bass, as part of the ''Live From Home'' series at the Housing Works Bookstore; on Tuesday she plays with yet another guitarist, Adam Levy, along with the pianist Art Hirahara and the bassist Matt Penman. Tonight at 7:30, Housing Works Bookstore, 126 Crosby Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-3324, www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe; cover, $20. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    SIMONE: A TRIBUTE TO NINA SIMONE (Tonight) An intensely personal tribute on the third anniversary of Nina Simone's death, featuring her daughter, the accomplished Broadway actress known simply as Simone, and her closest musical partner, the guitarist Al Shackman. The setting is Town Hall, site of a pivotal concert in her early career. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 and $37.50.(Chinen)    TIERNEY SUTTON /LOSTON HARRIS (Thursday through April 29) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer, as she has demonstrated on a number of recent engagements. She shares a bill with Mr. Harris, a singer and pianist with a style patterned after Nat King Cole. 7:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Chinen)    TERRASSON-OKEGWO-PARKER TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) Throughout the latter half of the 1990's, the pianist Jacky Terrasson led one of jazz's fresher-sounding acoustic piano trios, distinguished not only by his fluid pianism but also by the resonant bass tone of Ugonna Okegwo and the pared-down percussive drive of Leon Parker. Regrouping here, the musicians present themselves as a collective, which could well have positive implications for the music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with additional 11:30 shows next Friday and April 29, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and April 29. (Chinen)    CHARLES TOLLIVER'S MUSIC INC. CONTINUUM (Tomorrow) In the 1970's, Music Inc. was a heavy-gauge quartet designed to showcase the exertions of a blazing young trumpeter named Charles Tolliver. This reincarnation features Mr. Tolliver, whose recent re-emergence has been a welcome bit of news, and Cecil McBee, his original bassist; the continuum comes in the form of two youngbloods, the pianist Robert Glasper and the drummer E. J. Strickland. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766 ; cover, $20. (Chinen)    * RANDY WESTON AND THE GNAWA MASTER MUSICIANS OF MOROCCO (Tuesday) Mr. Weston, the leading practitioner of a distinctly African approach to jazz piano, has a history of serious collaboration with the Gnawa Master Musicians of Morocco. This free concert aims to capture the fire of a performance in Mr. Weston's native Brooklyn seven years ago, which has been issued on CD as ''Spirit! The Power of Music'' (Sunnyside). 7 p.m., World Financial Center Winter Garden, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'LA BOHÈME' (Sunday) James Robinson's City Opera production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. Yunah Lee sings Mimi, Eric Fennell steps in as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black is Musetta, and Philip Torre sings Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Jeremy Eichler)    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) On opening night at the New York City Opera, Kate Aldrich came through in the title role, capturing not only Carmen's devilish seductiveness but also her radical protofeminist pride in her own independence. Unfortunately, there was scant chemistry between her and Robert Breault as Don José. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Eichler)    'DON GIOVANNI' (Tonight) The second cast will offer the season's final performance of Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Timothy Kuhn, new to the company this season, sings the title role; also making a debut on this stage is Claudia Waite, as Donna Anna. 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Anne Midgette).    * 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he accomplished this vividly. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko, the dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $205 tickets remaining tonight, $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LOHENGRIN' (Monday) While Wagner's sprawling opera is playing at the Met, the Alliance Players offer the New York premiere of ''Lohengrin'' by the Italian avant-gardist Salvatore Sciarrino. This one-act opera is entirely introspective, based on what the composer calls the ''invisible action'' unfolding inside Elsa's mind. In his music, Mr. Sciarrino often paints with the finest of brushes, hinting at deep emotion through compressed whispers and the rustling of wind. For adventurous listeners, his interiorized postscript to Wagner promises to be fascinating. 8 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100; $35. (Eichler)    'MISS LONELYHEARTS' (Wednesday) Juilliard has done much commissioning to celebrate its centennial this year, including a new opera that's been in progress for some time. Lowell Liebermann's piece is based on Nathanael West's novella, with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, who has written or helped write librettos for significant works -- Tobias Picker's ''Emmeline,'' Lorin Maazel's ''1984,'' Ned Rorem's ''Our Town'' and Elliot Goldenthal's ''Grendel'' (opening at the Los Angeles Opera next month). Andreas Delfs conducts. 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 769-7406; $20, $10 for students and 65+. (Midgette).    * 'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) After five months' absence, Jonathan Miller's handsome production has returned to the line-up at the Met with an almost entirely new cast. The soprano Andrea Rost and the bass-baritone John Relyea are endearing as Susanna and Figaro. And the mezzo-soprano Alice Coote, in her first appearances at the Met, has been winning praise for her rich-voiced portrayal of the hormonal page boy Cherubino. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Thursday. (Tommasini)    'SUSANNAH' (Tonight through Sunday) It's easy to poke fun at Carlisle Floyd's opera for its folksy score, run through with hymn tunes, square dances and Appalachian ditties. Yet the opera, more sophisticated than it appears, about a sensual young woman in rural Tennessee who inadvertently stirs up envy and desire among the townspeople, has been moving audiences since its premiere in 1956. The Dicapo Opera Theater presents a 50th-anniversary production, directed by Michael Capasso and conducted by Steven Osgood. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438 ext. 10; $47.50. (Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Floria Tosca, opera's quintessential diva, is not a role for the fainthearted. Deborah Voigt, still searching for the perfect fit, role-wise, for her silvery voice, is taking it on at the Met for the first time. Franco Farina and James Morris can match her volume-wise if not with stylistic elegance. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $175 tickets remaining on Wednesday. (Midgette)    Classical Music    ALEXANDER STRING QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) With lots of Beethoven under its collective belt, this San Francisco-based ensemble is no stranger to marathon performance cycles, and this coming week, it begins another lightning traversal, this time of Shostakovich's 15 string quartets. Tuesday's performance features Nos. 1, 2 and 3; Wednesday brings Nos. 4, 5 and 6. The five-concert series runs through May 1. 8 p.m., Baruch College Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (646) 312-4085; $25. (Eichler)    AXIOM (Tonight) Jeffrey Milarsky conducts this newly hatched new-music chamber ensemble in Takemitsu's ''Tree Line,'' Birtwistle's ''Tragoedia,'' Webern's ''Konzert'' (Op. 24) and Steve Reich's ''City Life.'' 8, Studio 309, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, (212) 769-7406; free. (Allan Kozinn)    OLGA BORODINA and ILDAR ABDRAZAKOV (Tuesday) The creamy-voiced, languid Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina is one of the best we have today, although her gifts as a recitalist are mixed; the voice is beautiful, the presentation has been somewhat passive. Her husband, a bass, joins her for a program of Russian music, including songs and arias by Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and others. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Midgette)    BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC  (Tomorrow) Michael Christie, this orchestra's new music director, leads his charges in a program of symphonic pieces and songs celebrating contemporary urbanity, with the German cabaret star Ute Lemper as his soloist. Mr. Christie offers classic works by Bernstein, Gershwin, Copland, Eisler and Piazzolla, as well as more recent pieces by Heiner Goebbels, Kander and Ebb, and Chava Alberstein and Ms. Lemper's ''Ghosts of Berlin.'' 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Kozinn)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) ''Discoveries and Masterworks'' is the name of this two-part program that combines staples of the repertory with less-known works. Sunday's program juxtaposes Schoenberg and Brahms, Kurtag and Schumann; Tuesday's, Brahms's Piano Quartet in G minor with Chausson and Boccherini. Sunday at 5, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Midgette)    * EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary, and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. The quartet will perform them all, in chronological order, on five programs starting on Thursday. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)    * MIDORI (Tuesday) Is Midori maturing into an adventurous performer? Her hefty contemporary program -- Judith Weir's ''Music for 247 Strings,'' Isang Yun's Violin Sonata, Lutoslawski's Partita and works by Gyorgy Kurtag and Alexander Goehr -- suggests a willingness to leave the instant crowd pleasers behind and take some chances. Her longtime accompanist, Robert McDonald, is at the piano. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $48 to $54. (Kozinn)    * NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Monday) Joel Sachs leads his expert student ensemble in their final concert of season. The program, like many of Mr. Sachs's adventures, is international and far-flung, with works by Andrew Ford, from Australia; Ryan Francis, from the United States; Bernd Franke, from Germany; Jose Maceda, from the Philippines; and Milica Paranosic, from the former Yugoslavia. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)    * NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) Mstislav Rostropovich approaches the music of Shostakovich with more authority and close personal knowledge than just about anyone. He returns to the Philharmonic to lead the composer's 10th Symphony and his gripping First Violin Concerto, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $33 to $104. (Eichler)    'POCKET CONCERTOS' (Tomorrow) It's one thing to commission a new concerto; it's another to commission 12 of them. This weekend, Miller Theater introduces the first concert in a three-year project conceived to create works for soloists and sinfonietta by some of the theater's favorite composers. Two of the concertos on this first program are for piano -- John Musto will perform his own, and Ichizo Okashiro's will be played by his sister, Chitose -- one is for accordion, by Julia Wolfe; and Benedict Mason has written a double concerto for bass and tuba. George Steel, who runs the theater and conceived the project, conducts. 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $25. (Midgette)    CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Not many pianists can give their own preconcert lecture with the erudition that Charles Rosen will very likely muster as he concludes his series on ''Mozart Within History.'' The theme of this third installment is Mozart's influence on later generations of Romantic composers. The talk begins at 1:30 p.m., followed by the recital at 3 p.m., with works by Mozart, Schubert, Chopin and Liszt. Fred Sherry (cello) and David Bowlin (violin) join along the way. 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Eichler)    * VOICES OF ASCENSION (Wednesday) This superb church choir, led by Dennis Keene, goes ecumenical in a program devoted to Hebrew sacred settings, namely Bernstein's ''Chichester Psalms'' and Ernest Bloch's ''Avodath Hakodesh,'' a setting of the Sabbath morning service. 8 p.m., Church of the Ascension, Fifth Avenue at 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 358-1469; $10 to $45. (Kozinn)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

(Jennifer Dunning)    URSULA EAGLY AND REBECCA DAVIS (Thursday) Ms. Eagly and her ''Nobody Try to Be a Hero,'' inspired by the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002, return for another viewing in a shared program with Ms. Davis, whose ''The birds are here. I hear them.'' was inspired partly by Japanese classical poetry and chemical compounds.

(Dunning)    MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Today and Tuesday) The big event in the company's slightly threadbare 80th-anniversary season came earlier this week, but ancillary activities continue.

(Rockwell)    SYMPHONY SPACE DANCE SAMPLER (Tomorrow) What looks like a roster of hundreds of dance companies and individuals in all styles, some hot and some not, will perform in this 12-hour marathon. 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10 per three-hour segment. (Dunning)    AYNSLEY VANDENBROUCKE MOVEMENT GROUP (Wednesday) Circles symbolize communities in ''Full Circle,'' to be danced in the round with flashlights providing the only lighting. (Through April 29.) 8 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444 or www.smarttix.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Anderson)    YOUTH AMERICA GRAND PRIX 2006 GALA (Tomorrow and Sunday) Professional ballet dancers share the stage with winners of the Youth America ballet competition in ''Stars of Today Meet the Stars of Tomorrow,'' the contest's culminating gala. The already starry types include Igor Zelensky of the Kirov Ballet, Darcey Bussell of the Royal Ballet, and the Americans Karine Plantadit, fresh from ''Movin' Out''; Wendy Whelan of the New York City Ballet; and Marcelo Gomes and David Hallberg of American Ballet Theater. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.nycitycenter.org; $35 to $150. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY): FEMALE RESPONSES TO THE CLASSICAL IDEAL IN AMERICAN DECORATIVE ARTS,' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)    * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Smith)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman)     * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)    * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)     METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)    Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)    THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)      * The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (See above.) (Cotter)    National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)    NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)     P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through May 1. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter)     * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art, abstraction. This show is stylishly installed (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    * ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. & J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733, through May 6. (Smith)    '1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab where he was working. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    'When Artists Say We' This timely sociological experiment of a show features 17 artists or artist groups who were invited to create wall-diagrams or mini-exhibitions reflecting on the social networks out of which contemporary art emerges. Artists Space, 38 Green Street, (212) 226-3970, through April 29. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'B-Side' This engaging group show includes Tim Spelios's beautifully made Surrealistic drum set in which the components are square rather than round; Matt Freedman's life-size sculpture of a boy with a lion's teeth and elephant eyes; Mary Carlson's crocheted works, resembling splats of blood on the wall; Joyce Pensato's expressionistically painted clown face; Judith Page's ghoulish and viscous small portraits; Meredith Allen's funny and scary photographs of dogs; and a painting by Jim Torok that declares: ''You have no worries. Things are going well. Don't wake up.'' Sarah Bowen, 210 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-4517, through April 30. (Johnson)    'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)    Last Chance    PETER BEGLEY Parisian esprit enlivens Peter Begley's latest multipanel paintings. Their motif is the cornice: a ubiquitous emblem of Baron Haussmann's grand boulevards, which, abstracted and made delicately ornate, permits Mr. Begley to add illusory depth to his usual richly worked, waxy fields of warm color. Partly the filigree, partly the gentle rapture with his recently adopted city give to these new works a bit of the élan of old Raoul Dufy. Salander-OReilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606; through tomorrow. (Kimmelman)     'JANE FREILICHER: NEAR THE SEA: PAINTINGS 1958-63 The beautifully relaxed, nearly abstract paintings that were Jane Freilicher's initial response to the vistas of eastern Long Island add a surprising piece to the unruly puzzle of late-1950's art and sharpen your sense of her ambition and achievement. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050; through tomorrow. (Smith)     NAN GOLDIN: 'CHASING A GHOST' A riveting if flawed three-screen video projection titled ''Sisters, Saints & Sibyls'' hauntingly details the trauma that drives Ms. Goldin's invasive, yet oddly solitary photographs, as well as her lifelong battle with addiction.Its unalloyed honesty offers extreme evidence that most art begins in an attempt to heal a deep psychic wound. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200; through tomorrow. (Smith)    Markus Hansen: 'Other People's Feelings Are Also My Own' In high-definition video projections of pairs of photographs, Mr. Hansen, a Paris-based German artist, dresses like and adopts the facial expression of the man, woman or child in the picture next to his. Whatever his project means to say about modern identity, it is absorbing to study how closely he is able to match other people's feelings. Virgil de Voldere, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-9694; through tomorrow. (Johnson)    * MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark. GBE @ Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-5258; through tomorrow. (Smith)    Susie Rosmarin Proving that Op Art still is not dead, Ms. Rosmarin creates densely layered, gridded compositions of thin colored bands. The tautly frontal, vibrating patterns and pulsating spots of light engender a gripping retinal intensity. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227; through tomorrow.

Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' Opens Sunday. John Guare, never satisfied with an overly tidy play, throws comedy, tragedy, satire and mystery into this cult drama, which first opened almost three decades ago. Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott star (2:15). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.    'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB' Opens Sunday. C. J. Hopkins's dark drama, a hit at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival, is about a game show host even more bizarre than Bob Barker (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.    'AWAKE AND SING!' Opens Monday. Lincoln Center Theater revives Clifford Odets's classic fist-shaking drama about a Jewish family struggling to survive during the Depression. The impressive cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Ben Gazzara and Zoë Wanamaker (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST' Opens Tuesday. Closes May 14. Sir Peter Hall stages Oscar Wilde's indestructible comedy. Lynn Redgrave stars as Lady Bracknell (2:25). Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100.    'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' Opens Wednesday. Julia Roberts stars in this year's most closely watched star vehicle, a revival of the Richard Greenberg time-traveling drama about how we divide the legacy of our parents. Paul Rudd also stars (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Opens Thursday. If any Broadway theater was made for a revival of Brecht's classic, it's the cabaret-style Studio 54, which is host to an intriguing cast that includes Alan Cumming and Cyndi Lauper (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300.    'THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL' Previews start today. Opens May 7. Try not to think of Ross from ''Friends'' when you see David Schwimmer in this revival of Herman Wouk's adaptation of his Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about a lawyer who defends a Navy lieutenant accused of mutiny. Jerry Zaks directs (2:15). The Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' Opens May 1. This little-musical-that-could about an unscrupulous Broadway producer in the 1920's (some things never change) began at the Toronto Fringe Festival and now makes its unlikely premiere on the Great White Way (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.    'FAITH HEALER' Previews start Tuesday. Opens May 4. Ralph Fiennes, Cherry Jones and Ian McDiarmid make up the dream cast of this revival of Brian Friel's classic collection of ''Rashomon''-like monologues about a man peddling salvation, his long-suffering wife and his manager (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' Opens April 27. Redemption is a major theme of this musical fantasy adapted from a Peter S. Beagle novel about a recluse who lives in a Bronx cemetery (2:00). York Theater, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444.

The National Theater's artistic director Nicholas Hytner directs (2:45). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'HOT FEET' Previews start Thursday. Opens April 30. Earth, Wind and Fire get in on the jukebox musical trend with this new show about a woman who dreams of dancing on Broadway. Maurice Hines directs and choreographs (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100.    'LESTAT' Opens April 25. Elton John and Bernie Taupin have a good track record for making pop hits, but can they find success in the cursed genre of the vampire musical? Hugh Panaro stars (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, (212) 307-4100.    'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Previews start Wednesday. Opens May 3. The Atlantic Theater Company's acclaimed production of Martin McDonagh's very bloody, exceptionally black comedy about Irish terrorism moves to Broadway (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'SHINING CITY' Previews start Thursday. Opens May 9.

Phil Collins lends his invisible touch to the score of the latest Disney musical. David Henry Hwang wrote the book (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100.    'THE WEDDING SINGER' Opens April 27. Stephen Lynch plays the goofy title character in this musical adaptation of the Adam Sandler film about leg warmers, Billy Idol and other artifacts from the 1980's. John Rando (''Urinetown'') directs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who re-tailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)    'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LOS BIG NAMES'  In the lesbian comic Marga Gomez's friendly new solo show, she measures out affection and mockery in equal doses as she recalls her parents, Willy and Margarita, a comic and a dancer who lived a splashy life on a small scale in the circumscribed world of New York Latino culture in the 1960's. Ms. Gomez pairs stories of their performing careers with comic tales of her own struggles to pursue success in the entertainment industry. A sendup of the movie ''Sphere'' is particularly delicious (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Goes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SHOW PEOPLE'  Paul Weitz's eyebrow-pencil-thin comedy about a man who hires actors to impersonate his family feels like one long, occasionally amusing party game whose players don't know when to call it a night. The excellent four-member cast, led by Debra Monk and directed by Peter Askin, finds charm and energy amid the vaporous bait-and-switch plot reversals (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)    'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE MASTER RACE' Bertolt Brecht's middle-period classic in a robust new translation by Binyamin Shalom and a spare and powerful production by the Roust Theater Company, directed by James Phillip Gates (2:45). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. (Hunka)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE CATARACT' Though it begins promisingly -- a funny Midwestern noir in the style of the Coen brothers -- Lisa D'Amour's play about Southern drifters unsettling upright Minnesotans soon loses its balance, swamped by a torrent of magical realism and psychobabble (2:15). Women's Project/Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Miriam Horn)    'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555; closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    'PEN'  David Marshall Grant's sometimes preachy new three-character play is about an unhappy Long Island family in 1969. J. Smith-Cameron is fascinating to watch as she exposes the anguish behind the tough, angry exterior of the wheelchair-bound mother; Dan McCabe is uneven but believable as the troubled teenage son who wants to get away from her; and Reed Birney is less persuasive as the ex-husband who has already left. The title object is a gift from the author to himself: it allows something impossible to happen (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON'  A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger)    'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by clichés and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. ( Genzlinger)    'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)    'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis)    'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Dana Stevens)    * 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Stephen Holden)    * 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who co-stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)    'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)    * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)    'LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO' (R, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Zoë (Bárbara Mori) is a gorgeous, vapid wife who longs for children, but her distant spouse (Christian Meier) makes love only on Saturdays. Enter the rebellious brother-in-law (Manolo Cardona), a smoldering artist whose schedule is less regimented. Bubbling with incest, adultery, religion and homosexuality, ''La Mujer de Mi Hermano'' is an overheated telenovela that considers procreation more important than honesty, and what we want more important than who we are. (Catsoulis)    'LOOK BOTH WAYS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Written and directed by the Australian animator Sarah Watt, ''Look Both Ways'' follows a group of disparate and desperate characters over the course of one of the most depressing weekends in movie history. The principal sufferers are Meryl (Justine Clarke), a morbid illustrator, and Nick (William McInnes), a terminally ill photographer, who discover that a mutual fixation on catastrophe can be quite the aphrodisiac. Bogged down by stylistic gimmickry, ''Look Both Ways'' aims for existential drama but succeeds only in reminding us that misery loves company. (Catsoulis)    'LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN' (R, 110 minutes) This star-studded jigsaw puzzle of revenge and mistaken identity thinks that it's terribly smart, although it amounts to an empty, self-satisfied imitation of ''Pulp Fiction'' that reputable actors like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley can't salvage. (Holden)    'MARILYN HOTCHKISS BALLROOM DANCING AND CHARM SCHOOL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) John Goodman plays a dying crash victim on his way to a 40-year-old appointment, and Robert Carlyle is the widowed baker entrusted with keeping it. Instead, he meets Marisa Tomei, who teaches him to dance and, more important, throw away his wife's ashes. Toggling back and forth between past and present, ''Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School'' is a soggy, endless wallow in nostalgia and the healing power of very bad dancing. (Catsoulis)    'ON A CLEAR DAY' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Set in and around the dockyards of Glasgow, ''On a Clear Day'' follows Frank (the great Peter Mullan), a laid-off shipbuilder who decides to fix his life by swimming the English Channel. Despite a familiar crop of lovable eccentrics and predictably inspirational thrust, the movie balances the sentimentality with excellent performances and a healthy dose of working-class vulnerability. (Catsoulis)    'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Nathan Lee)    '16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis)    'SISTERS IN LAW' (No rating, 108 minutes, in English and pidgin) Grass-roots feminism thrives in a Cameroon village, thanks to the pair of warm-hearted, tough-minded women of law profiled in this excellent verité documentary. (Lee)    * 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)    'TAKE THE LEAD' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Hip-hop and ballroom dancing styles fuse in a South Bronx high school at which a dance teacher, Antonio Banderas, turns gawky ducklings into gliding swans. It's sloppy but mildly endearing. (Holden)    'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)    'TORO NEGRO' (No rating, 87 minutes, in Spanish) A disturbed young matador stabs animals, beats his wife and drinks himself to the edge of oblivion in this harrowing, deeply suspect documentary set in rural Mexico. (Lee)    * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)    'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)    'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)    * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or a turnoff.

His turns of phrase establish him as an MC, but by singing his own hooks in a deep authoritative voice, he stands out among his peers. Lil' Flip is another Houston luminary with a sing-song flow and class-clown snaps. 9 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    ABDULLAH CHHADEH (Wednesday) Abdullah Chhadeh plays the qanun (an 81-string zitherlike instrument) with his ensemble Nara. The group uses jazz double bass and Western percussion, as well as the nay (reed flute), darbuka (hand drum) and Arabic accordion. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)    CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH (Tonight and tomorrow) The Brooklyn quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah recalls the shamanic whine and thrum of the mid-1990's lo-fi rockers Neutral Milk Hotel, and sometimes the slippery paranoid quirk of the Talking Heads. 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; (sold out). (Sinagra)    THE COUP (Tomorrow) The funky, political Coup took flak in 2001 for a pre-9/11 album cover featuring exploding twin towers. But the group's main man, Boots Riley, has lost none of the oppositional fervor. 10 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484; $25 general admission; $15 for New York University faculty and staff; $7 for N.Y.U. students. (Sinagra)    LILY CUSHMAN CULHANE, THE REPUTATION (Monday) Lily Cushman Culhane sings dry, breathy torch songs over rattletrap grooves that recall Tom Waits's early-90's albums. Elizabeth Elmore of the Reputation writes punchy melodic rock anthems about tricky romance. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $8. (Sinagra)    ELBOW, THE CLOUD ROOM (Thursday) Elbow is one of many British bands that have emerged in the wake of Radiohead and Spiritualized, mixing cinematic sonic drift with pointillist emotional disclosure. The new-wave-influenced naïf rockers the Cloud Room garnered wild, though deeply underground, buzz for their best song, ''Hey Hey Now,'' which never broke into the larger indie-pop consciousness. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $2o in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE FIERY FURNACES (Wednesday) This brother-and-sister art-rock duo's music cuts melodies with carnivalesque keyboard vamps and digressive skronk. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sinagra)    FIGURINES (Wednesday) The Danish rock band Figurines distinguishes itself from the current glut of post-punk formalists by aping instead the frustrated eeriness of Northwestern indie-rock bands like Modest Mouse. The vocalist Christian Hjelm balances art-song archness and lonely busker frailty. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra)    FRANZ FERDINAND, DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE (Tonight) At the vanguard of the post-post-punk trend, the poker-faced Franz Ferdinand plays herky-jerky party music. Death Cab is a decorous diarist-rock band whose sound gets added alternative-rock heft on the recent ''Plans'' (Atlantic). 6, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212) 564-4882; $40. (Sinagra)    JAMMY AWARDS (Thursday) This is the night when the jam band world proves that its vision extends beyond Grateful Dead approximations. This year's performers include a grab bag of classic rock vets (Little Feat, Peter Frampton); legends of quick-fingered instrumentalism (Bela Fleck, Joe Satriani); and beat scientists (Mad Professor, DJ Logic), as well as the Senegalese great Baaba Maal, the august folkie Richie Havens and the road-tested heroes of the jam scene, Blues Traveler. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $54.50. (Sinagra)    SHOOTER JENNINGS, DIAMOND NIGHTS (Tuesday) Mr. Jennings follows the outlaw tradition of his legendary father, Waylon, and shares his rough-hewn singing style. But while the younger Mr. Jennings's music is decidedly country, he adds his own classic-rock-informed sensibility. The Diamond Nights of New York play 70's hard-rock with a dollop of new wave. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $17.50 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)    ROBERT EARL KEEN (Tomorrow) This gravel-voiced Texas songwriter, a contemporary of Lyle Lovett and Nanci Griffith, is a storyteller who can unfurl a sad-luck tale with genuine heart and a sardonic twinge. Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra)    R. KELLY (Tuesday) Few artists have turned their personal travails into unique pop music like R. Kelly, whose multi-part R&B saga ''Trapped in the Closet'' is a singularly strange psychosexual ramble. He is billing himself as Mr. Showbiz for this ''Light It Up'' tour, presenting a parade of hits that downplays any voyeuristic weirdness without skimping on the up-front sexuality that has made him famous and dangerous. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 247-4777; $39.50 to $89.50. (Sinagra)    TALIB KWELI (Tomorrow) The brainy rapper Talib Kweli's agile attack still lacks Jay-Z's precision, 50 Cent's swagger and Nas's anguish. But his thrust can be raw and his struggle beautiful when he laments things like Lauryn Hill's absence from the music scene. 11 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra)    LADYTRON (Tomorrow) Influenced by 1980's synth-pop's great songwriting as well as its style, Ladytron arrived before New York's fleeting electroclash moment, and it has survived it, playing dark, droning dance-pop cut with a romantic sense of alienation. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; (sold out). (Sinagra)    ALAN LICHT AND THE PRIX (Monday) For this get-together of indie-rock vets, the experimental guitarist Alan Licht will be backed by the guitarist Chris Brokaw (formerly of Come and Codeine), the bassist Doug McCombs (of Tortoise), and the drummer Elliott Dicks. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $8. (Sinagra)    THOMAS MAPFUMO AND THE BLACKS UNLIMITED (Tuesday) A musical pioneer with a rebel's courage, Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled government from what was Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe. The music transferred the brisk patterns of traditional thumb-piano music to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. 9 and 11:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    JOAN OSBORNE (Tuesday) Best known for her hit song musing on the Almighty, ''One of Us,'' Joan Osborne has since focused on the blues and R&B tradition in which she got her start. Expect lots of classic covers and possibly a display of the Qawwali singing she learned from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. 8 p.m., Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $25. (Sinagra)    ROBERT POLLARD, RICHARD DAVIES (Thursday) The prolific recording maven Robert Pollard may have disbanded his much beloved band, Guided by Voices, but he continues to record and perform with undeterred gusto. The Australian singer-songwriter Richard Davies has pursued a solo career after playing in the baroque-pop outfit the Cardinal. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    Sufi music with AHMET OZHAN AND THE WHIRLING DERVISHES (Tomorrow) Accompanied by the ritual Sufi dancers of the Istanbul Mevlevi Order, the singer Ahmet Ozhan will perform songs in the classical mystic tradition. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20 to $100. (Sinagra)    TV ON THE RADIO (Tuesday) TV on the Radio tops its jittery rhythms and paranoid guitars with the haunting vocal yelps of Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone. They are soon to release a major-label debut, reportedly even more out-there than their indie releases. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; (sold out) . (Sinagra)    DAR WILLIAMS (Tuesday) This adorable coffeehouse singer-songwriter augments her sweet voice with that rare quality of seeming like a real person. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or Ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $30. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    * KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit. But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $60 cover, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden)    BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $75, including brunch at noon. (Holden)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)    BABY JANE DEXTER (Tomorrow) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)    * MARY CLEERE HARAN  (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) A wonderful no-frills singer with a sophisticated wit, Ms. Haran has a remarkable talent for simultaneously interpreting standards in the spirit in which they were written and looking at them through 21st-century eyes. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $60 tonight and tomorrow; $50 Tuesday through Thursday. (Holden)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Tuesday) As the name implies, this 18-piece big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a sound that suggests Steve Reich minimalism as well as orchestral jazz in the lineage of Bob Brookmeyer (one of Mr. Argue's mentors). The ranks of the band include such hale improvisers as the trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin and the trombonist Alan Ferber. 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, between Houston and Bleecker Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 614-0505; cover, $12. (Nate Chinen)    OMER AVITAL GROUP (Thursday) The bassist Omer Avital, a staple of the West Village club Smalls during its premillennial first run, is back after a spell in his native Israel, with new music and a new stable of bands. This one consists of Joel Frahm on tenor saxophone, Avishai Cohen on trumpet, Omer Klein on piano and Greg Hutchinson on drums. 10 p.m. and midnight, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $20; includes two drinks. (Chinen)    TIM BERNE'S BIG SATAN (Wednesday) Mr. Berne, a vigorous and exploratory alto saxophonist, makes interplay the driving force in his band with the guitarist Marc Ducret and the drummer Tom Rainey. This one-night stand kicks off a month of touring. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)    RON CARTER/KARRIN ALLYSON (Tuesday through April 23) Mr. Carter, an august and influential bassist, has had mixed success as a bandleader; his best efforts usually involve the articulate pianist Stephen Scott, who joins him in this quartet. Ms. Allyson comes bearing a new album, ''Footprints'' (Concord), which delves into Jon Hendricks-style vocalese; as on the album, she digs in here with a strong ensemble spearheaded by the pianist Bruce Barth. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    LARRY CORYELL, VICTOR BAILEY AND LENNY WHITE (Through Sunday) Their recent album, ''Electric'' (Chesky), works hard to deserve the moniker; it relies equally on Mr. Coryell's searing guitar, Mr. Bailey's electric bass and Mr. White's earthy drumming. 8 and 10 p.m., with 11:30 sets tonight and tomorrow night. Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    STEVE DAVIS QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) A trombonist steeped in precise and pugnacious hard bop, with a group consisting of Steve Nelson on vibraphone, Larry Willis on piano, Nat Reeves on bass and Joe Farnsworth on drums. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    THE FRANK AND JOE SHOW (Wednesday) Exuberance is the currency of this four-piece band, which finds equal inspiration in swing (both the American and Gypsy varieties) and Latin music (or some approximation thereof). Frank is Frank Vignola, a guitarist; the Joe in the equation is Joe Ascione, a drummer. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    * BILL FRISELL QUINTET (Tuesday through April 23; April 25 through 30) On his latest Nonesuch releases -- ''East/West'' and ''Further East/Further West,'' both partly recorded at the Village Vanguard -- the guitarist Bill Frisell conjures a compelling hallucination of the American popular songbook, with Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen on bass and drums. The addition of the saxophonist Greg Tardy and the trumpeter Ron Miles should alter the ensemble's chemistry as well as its size. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 on Fridays and Saturdays, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    EDDIE GALE'S NOW BAND (Tomorrow through Monday) Mr. Gale is a trumpeter with serious avant-garde credentials, having worked closely with the trailblazers Cecil Taylor and Sun Ra, among others. Visiting from the West Coast, he makes three stops in as many days, with a group of estimable players including the trombonist Dick Griffin and the bassist Todd Nicholson.

(Chinen)    MARY HALVORSON AND JESSICA PAVONE (Thursday) Ms. Halvorson plays guitar in this duo, and Ms. Pavone plays viola. Their experimental instincts, sharpened by an affiliation with Anthony Braxton, commingle with a folksy lyricism; sometimes they even sing, without a trace of protective irony. 8 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village; cover, $10. www.thestonenyc.com. (Chinen)    BILLY HART QUARTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Hart, a loose but focused drummer with a sterling résumé, fronts a dream team of younger players: the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the bassist Ben Street. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Tomorrow) This improvising chamber ensemble pursues texturally oriented and often contrapuntal exploration; Mr. Hollenbeck's drumming is one color on a palette that also includes Chris Speed's clarinet and tenor saxophone, Ted Reichman's accordion, John Hebert's bass and Matt Moran's vibraphone. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    DAVID LIEBMAN QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) An incantatory saxophonist working in the post-Coltrane idiom, Mr. Liebman plays here with a group featuring a frequent foil, the guitarist Vic Juris. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    LIONEL LOUEKE TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Loueke, a distinctive guitarist and vocalist, favors a form of global jazz deeply informed by his West African homeland, Benin; his bandmates are the bassist Massimo Biolcati and the drummer Ferenc Nemeth. 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen)    RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA QUARTET (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Mahanthappa uses both his razor-sharp alto saxophone tone and his compositional acumen in this group, with the pianist Vijay Iyer, the bassist François Moutin and the drummer Dan Weiss. The group is introducing ''Code Book,'' a work created with support from Chamber Music America, that will be the substance of Mr. Mahanthappa's next release. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen)    REBECCA MARTIN (Thursday) A singer-songwriter with no small affinity for jazz harmony, Ms. Martin gets more than the usual support from her ensemble, which includes the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry and the bassist Larry Grenadier, her husband. She shares a bill with Trevor Exter, a cellist and vocalist riding the contemporary current of acoustic pop. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    PAT MARTINO QUINTET (Thursday through April 23) The guitarist Pat Martino's new Blue Note album, ''Remember: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery,'' does exactly what it purports to do. And it works, because of the untroubled self-assurance of the emulation and the simple satisfaction of a hard-swinging band. 8 and 10 p.m., with 11:30 sets on Friday and Saturday, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    MULGREW MILLER QUARTET (Through Saturday) Mr. Miller is a smart pianist with roots firmly planted in jazz tradition, especially the blues.

(Chinen)    FRANK MORGAN QUARTET (Tuesday through April 23) Now in his 70's, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan is one of the last survivors of the bebop era (and in his case, ''survivor'' is truly the appropriate term). He leads a sympathetic group consisting of John Hicks on piano, Curtis Lundy on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    JENNY SCHEINMAN TRIO (Tuesday) As a violist and violinist, Ms. Scheinman often goes for rustic charm, but she never ceases to be an exploratory improviser. Her more experimental side is purposefully exposed in this setting, featuring the darkly consonant bass playing of Todd Sickafoose and the explosively elastic drumming of Jim Black. 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    JANIS SIEGEL (Wednesday through April 21) With her new album, ''A Thousand Beautiful Things'' (Telarc), Ms. Siegel applies her self-assured alto to songs by Raul Midón, Suzanne Vega and Nellie McKay. It's the same sort of popular eclecticism she enjoys in Manhattan Transfer, but a few degrees less cloying. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30; $40 on April 21; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    JOHN TCHICAI TRIO (Sunday) The Danish saxophonist and clarinetist John Tchicai developed a reputation for fiery exertions during the first wave of free jazz, but ''Good Night Songs'' (Boxholder), his new double CD with the saxophonist Charlie Kohlhase and the guitarist Garrison Fewell, conveys an often tenderhearted intimacy. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $12, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'ACIS AND GALATEA'  (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) Mark Lamos's enchanting production of Handel's opera, introduced in 2001, returns to the New York City Opera with two artists making their company debuts in the leading roles. The soprano Sarah Jane McMahon is Galatea, the sea nymph hopelessly in love with a young sailor, Acis, sung by the tenor Philippe Castagner. Ransom Wilson conducts. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $110. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LA BOHèME' (Tonight) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. A mostly new cast at the City Opera has taken over, with Yunah Lee as Mimi, Gerard Powers as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black as Musetta and Philip Torre as Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $110. (Jeremy Eichler)    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Devilish is what you want in a Carmen, and on opening night at the New York City Opera, Kate Aldrich came through in that role, capturing not only Carmen's seductiveness but also her radical proto-feminist pride in her own independence. Unfortunately, there was scant chemistry between her and Robert Breault as Don José. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out tomorrow; $25 to $120 on Wednesday. (Eichler)    'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow) A new cast takes over for the end of the spring run of Mozart's nearly perfect opera at the New York City Opera. Timothy Kuhn will make his company debut in the title role; Claudia Waite will make hers as Donna Anna; and Caroline Worra should be a credible Donna Elvira. Steven Mosteller conducts, adequately. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 to $79. (Anne Midgette)    'DON GIOVANNI' (Tonight and tomorrow night) Amato's venerable recipe -- no rehearsals, changing casts at every performance -- should make for an unusual version of Mozart's classic dish, but at least the theater's small scale represents a kind of period fidelity. 7:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)    * 'DON PASQUALE' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk understands that the way to make a rich, comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he taps into the emotions -- jealousy, yearning, fear of death -- that swirl below the surface of this farcical tale about a miserly bachelor who foolishly decides to take a young wife and disinherit his shiftless nephew. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko, the dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. (On Tuesday, Lyubov Petrova sings Norina in place of Ms. Netrebko, and John Del Carlo replaces Mr. Alaimo.) Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Tommasini)    'LOHENGRIN' (Monday and Thursday) Robert Wilson's luminous production of this luminous opera is not to every taste, but many find that it shines, and Karita Mattila should shine in it as Elsa. The title role should also fit Ben Heppner well. Luana DeVol, an American soprano who has been active mainly in Germany, is Ortrud. Replacing James Levine in the pit is the promising conductor Philippe Auguin, who made his Met debut replacing Mr. Levine in Busoni's ''Doktor Faustus.'' 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Midgette)    'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight) The Met's long-running and highly successful production finally comes to a close, here with Hei-Kyung Hong, Frank Lopardo and Dwayne Croft. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out. (Bernard Holland)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) A weekly presenter of chamber music, this floating concert hall also offers great views of Lower Manhattan. Tonight at 7:30, Dmitri Alexeev performs piano works by Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, Scriabin and Rachmaninoff. Concerts tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m. feature rarely heard music by the 18th-century Russian violinist Ivan Khandoshkin, along with Haydn, Shostakovich and Schubert. Sunday evening at 7:30 is a rescheduled performance of music by Messiaen, Beethoven and others. Thursday evening at 7:30, Carlos Prieto (cello) and Doris Stevenson (piano) survey more Shostakovich, as well as Piazzolla's ''Grand Tango.'' Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35, tomorrow and Sunday afternoon, $40. (Eichler)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Wednesday) There will be Beethoven and Janacek quartets, and then the Pacifica and Miro Quartets will merge in the Mendelssohn Octet. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $30 to $52. (Holland)    IL DOLCIMELO (Sunday) This German period-instrument ensemble makes its New York debut with works by Vivaldi, Scarlatti, Corelli and Telemann. 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; $20. (Eichler)    JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Tuesday) The venerable Juilliard offers Mozart, Shostakovich and Brahms. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)    * NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Mstislav Rostropovich approaches the music of Shostakovich with more authority and close personal knowledge than just about anyone. He returns to the Philharmonic to lead the composer's 10th Symphony and his gripping First Violin Concerto, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist. 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $33 to $104. (Eichler)    ORCHESTRA OF THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT (Sunday) The key names here are less the orchestra's than that of René Jacobs, a conductor (and singer) who has reawakened many corners of period performance, and of Solomon, the title character in Handel's oratorio. Handel switched largely from opera to oratorio in the 1740's and wrote new oratorios for each Lenten season, so this offering is seasonal as well as inherently appealing. 3 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $56 (Midgette)    POMERIUM (Tomorrow) Alexander Blachly's superb early-music choir offers an Easter program with motets composed for Holy Week by Renaissance and early-Baroque composers, including Dufay, Senfl, Lassus, Gesualdo, Monteverdi and Byrd. 1 and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290; $35. (Allan Kozinn)    * 'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' (Tonight and tomorrow) After acclaimed presentations in 1997 and 2001, Jonathan Miller's revelatory staging of Bach's astounding sacred work has returned to the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The chorus members and orchestra musicians wear everyday clothing and sit facing one another in a circle so that they can enact the scenes from the story of Jesus' Crucifixion. Instrumentalists and singers interact with and even comfort one another during the sublime arias. Rufus Müller is a charismatic Evangelist; Curtis Streetman makes an affectingly husky and noble Jesus. Paul Goodwin, who conceived the production with Mr. Miller, conducts. 7:30 p.m., 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $30 to $90. (Tommasini)    * SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY (Wednesday and Thursday) Michael Tilson Thomas has made this orchestra into one of the country's best, and its visits to Carnegie Hall are invariably illuminating. His programs include a range of composers from the late-19th and early-20th centuries, among them, Debussy, Ravel, Wagner and Mahler on Wednesday, and Webern, Stravinsky and Ives on Thursday. Jean-Yves Thibaudet is the soloist in the Ravel Piano Concerto in G. 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Kozinn)    FAZIL SAY (Tonight) This young Turkish pianist plays with energy and, when he is at his best, the improvisatory sensibilities of a jazz performer. His program includes the Brahms Intermezzi (Op. 117) and plenty of Bach, both straight (the Italian Concerto and the French Suite No. 6) or hyphenated (Busoni's transcription of the Chaconne, along with arrangements by Liszt and Mr. Say himself). 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Kozinn)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    ALLEN BODY GROUP AND JENNIE MARYTAI LiU (Tonight and tomorrow) Science is the inspiration for Malinda Allen's ''Einstein's Dreams'' and Ms. Liu's ''Learning in Lower Animals.'' 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org. Tickets: $20. (Jennifer Dunning)    'A BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT' (Tomorrow) This benefit for Jonah Bokaer's new Chez Bushwick Studios is a tribute to Charles Atlas, a filmmaker who has worked with Merce Cunningham. The evening includes a screening of a film and video work by Mr. Atlas (5 p.m.), a performance by artists who have collaborated with Mr. Atlas (7:30 p.m.) and a ''Shtudio Show'' (at 9 p.m. ) Chez Bushwick Studios, 304 Boerum Street, Apt. 11, Bushwick, Brooklyn, (917) 459-1072. Tickets: $50 and $150; $250 includes cocktails and dinner. (Dunning)    BALLET FIESTA MEXICANA (Tonight through Sunday) Yloy Ybarra's company returns in a program of music and dance from Mexico, with live music performed by the group Semilla. Through April 30. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880. Tickets: $25 to $30. (Dunning)    CHILDREN OF UGANDA (Tonight through Sunday) Twenty children, ages 8 to 18, will celebrate the culture of their country and of East Africa in song and dance to raise money for Uganda's 1.7 million AIDS and war orphans. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $25; $15 for children. (Dunning)    SELMA JEANNE COHEN: A TRIBUTE TO HER LIFE AND WORK (Tomorrow) The last event in this free series is ''Next Week, Swan Lake: Approaches to Dance History and Criticism,'' a panel discussion including Mindy Aloff, Jack Anderson, Marcia Siegel and George Dorris. 3 p.m., Bruno Walter Auditorium, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 642-0142. Free. (Dunning)    'DANCE PLUS SPRING' (Thursday through April 23) The program includes dances by David Dorfman, Julia Ritter, John Evans, Randy James and Paulette Sears, all dance teachers, and Megan Hebert, a student choreographer. Thursday, next Friday and April 22 at 8 p.m.; April 23 at 2 p.m., Mason Gross Performing Arts Center, 85 George Street, between Route 18 and Ryders Lane, Douglass College campus, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 932-7511 or masongross.rutgers.edu. Tickets: $20 (Dunning)    * MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday) The company seems to be in transition, to put it mildly, but it is still the primary keeper of some of the great modern-dance repertory of the last century, and of some wonderful dancers. The major event is a gala on Tuesday that includes Richard Move, the Graham impersonator, performing a duet with Desmond Richardson, and a solo by Fang-Yi Sheu. 7:30 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South. For $45 performance tickets, (212) 992-8484; for $150 and $500 gala tickets, (212) 521-3667, or marthagraham.org. Also on Tuesday, five generations of Graham performers will give a master class in the studio where Graham taught in the 1930's. 11:30 a.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5553. Audience: $15. Participants: $12 for professionals, $15 for others. Ancillary events continue on April 21 and 25. (John Rockwell)    MARIA HASSABI (Tonight and tomorrow) Hip, rawly emotional and mysterious, Ms. Hassabi will present her new program, ''Still Smoking,'' which investigates the frenetic experience of city life. Tonight at 7 and 9:30; tomorrow at 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11, thekitchen.org. Tickets: $12. (Dunning)    LEADING LADIES: ALETHEA ADSITT & COMPANY  (Tonight and tomorrow) This festival of dances by women continues with ''the new jalopy,'' a new multimedia, site-specific piece presented by Alethea Adsitt & Company. 8 and 10 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, SoHo, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com or dnadance.org. Tickets: $17. (Dunning)    NEWSTEPS (Thursday through April 22) Miriam Hess, Jessica Ray and Adrienne F. Westwood are among those featured, as the Mulberry Street Theater's semiannual choreographers' showcase explores themes of power, relationship and memory. 8 p.m., 70 Mulberry Street, second floor (corner of Mulberry and Bayard Streets), Chinatown, (212) 349-0126. Tickets: $12. (Claudia La Rocco)    DAVID PARKER AND THE BANG GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) The irrepressible Mr. Parker will present dances that include his new ''Backward and in Heels,'' a piece for six dancers that is set to music. That music incorporates excerpts from the score from ''The Sound of Music''; ''Hava Nagila,'' played by a hand-bell choir; and Schubert's ''Ave Maria.'' 8:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org. Tickets: $21. (Dunning)    MARISSA PEREL (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Perel, who has worked with Miguel Gutierrez, will present her new ''Burden,'' a dance performance and installation that also features the dancer Kayvon Pourazar and the musician Jon Moniaci. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. The Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com. Tickets: $15. (Dunning)    * STEPHEN PETRONIO COMPANY (Tuesday through Sunday) What do you get when you mix the singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, the Young People's Chorus of New York City and Stephen Petronio's extravagant movement language? A concert not to be missed. Tuesday through April 22 at 8 p.m., April 23 at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $40. (La Rocco)    PILAR RIOJA (Tonight through Sunday) It almost doesn't matter what this New York favorite performs, but for the record, the program will include some of Ms. Rioja's favorite flamenco dances. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Monday at 11 a.m. Repertorio Español, 138 East 27th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212) 225-9920. Tickets: $25 to $50. (Dunning)    RUSSIAN NATIONAL BALLET (Tomorrow) An indefatigable touring company based in Moscow, with guest stars from elsewhere in Russia, in ''Swan Lake,'' of all things. 8 p.m., Queensborough Performing Arts Center, Queensborough Community College, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, Queens, (718) 631-6311. Tickets: $39 and $42. (Rockwell)    * SOURCING STRAVINSKY (Wednesday through April 22) Six choreographers take on Stravinsky, with Yvonne Rainer (in a rare new dance work) using both Stravinsky and Balanchine's ''Agon.'' The other choreographers are Cynthia Hopkins, Dayna Hanson and Linas Phillips, David Neumann and Rennie Harris. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org. Tickets: $15 and $25. (Rockwell)    'TRAS LADOS' (Thursday through April 23) Artists from Mexico to Japan come together for the latest installment of Danspace Project's Global Exchange series. Choreographed by Eun Jung Gonzalez, in collaboration with Pulso Compañía de Danza. 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or danspaceproject.org. Tickets: $15. (La Rocco)    TRINAYAN COLLECTIVE (Tonight through Sunday) This New York-based company of Indian classical dancers will explore the notion of the witness in ''Sakshi/Witness,'' a dance in the Odissi style. 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $25; $20 for students and 65+. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)    * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)    * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)    Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)    THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)    THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (See above.) (Cotter)    National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)    NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)     P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through April 24. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)    * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art, abstraction. This show is stylishly installed (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    PETER BEGLEY Parisian esprit enlivens Peter Begley's latest multipanel paintings. Their motif is the cornice: a ubiquitous emblem of Baron Haussmann's grand boulevards, which, abstracted and made delicately ornate, permits Mr. Begley to add illusory depth to his usual richly worked, waxy fields of warm color. Partly the filigree, partly the gentle rapture with his recently adopted city give to these new works a bit of the élan of old Raoul Dufy. Salander-OReilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606, through April 22. (Kimmelman)    Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson)    '1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab where he was working. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)    * NAGASAWA ROSETSU This rare survey of this eccentric painter of 18th-century Kyoto consists of 14 works that reveal a breathtaking command of different skills and styles in portraiture, landscape, nature painting and calligraphic minimalism, and an almost chameleonlike instinct for using them. Koichi Yanagi Oriental Fine Arts, 58A East 66th Street, (212) 744-5577, through Thursday. (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    Rico Gatson: 'African Fractals' Mr. Gatson's suave geometric paintings and sculptures of symbolically charged vernacular objects -- a whipping post in the form of a Christian cross with wrist-holes, for example -- feature African-style stripe patterns, creating a dialogue between utopian modernism and tragic social history. A video installation produces hypnotic patterns out of films of the pageantry surrounding the great boxing match between Muhammed Ali and George Foreman that took place in Zaire in 1974. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through April 22. (Johnson)    Joëlle Tuerlinckx: 'Drawing Inventory' A prominent Belgian Conceptualist presents a dry and oblique installation consisting of a large quantity of ordinary materials more or less related to the art of drawing. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through April 22. (Johnson)    'When Artists Say We' This timely sociological experiment of a show features 17 artists or artist groups who were invited to create wall-diagrams or mini-exhibitions reflecting on the social networks out of which contemporary art emerges. Artists Space, 38 Green Street, (212) 226-3970, through April 29. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Tara Donovan Known for creating improbable accumulations of ordinary things, Ms. Donovan here has arranged three million plastic cups in stacks from ankle-high to five feet. They make a 50-by-60-foot rectangle on the floor, resembling a lumpy field of snow. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-7000, through April 22. (Johnson)    NAN GOLDIN: 'CHASING A GHOST' A riveting if flawed three-screen video projection titled ''Sisters, Saints & Sibyls'' hauntingly details the trauma that drives Ms. Goldin's invasive, yet oddly solitary photographs, as well as her lifelong battle with addiction: the suicide of her troubled older sister in 1965 at the age of 18. The piece mixes video, family snapshots and the artist's photographs, and is heightened by a sensitive selection of music that may almost do too much of the work. But its unalloyed honesty offers extreme evidence that most art begins in an attempt to heal a deep psychic wound. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, through April 22. (Smith)    Markus Hansen: 'Other People's Feelings Are Also My Own' In high-definition video projections of pairs of photographs, Mr. Hansen, a Paris-based German artist, dresses like and adopts the facial expression of the man, woman or child in the picture next to his. Whatever his project means to say about modern identity, it is absorbing to study how closely he is able to match other people's feelings, which range from carefree happiness to doleful anxiety. Virgil de Voldere, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 343-9694, through April 22. (Johnson)    * MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark, and adds another twist to the convoluted history of appropriation art. GBE @ Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258, through April 22. (Smith)    Eve K. Tremblay: 'Tales Without Grounds' A rising young Canadian photographer presents glossy staged photographs of people doing enigmatic things in and around a large facility for hydroponic lettuce cultivation. With their cinematically intense colors, Ms. Tremblay's pictures are like stills from a Tarkovskian science fiction movie. Buia, 541 West 23rd Street, (212) 366-9915, through April 22. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'B-Side' This engaging group show includes Tim Spelios's beautifully made Surrealistic drum set in which the components are square rather than round; Matt Freedman's life-size sculpture of a boy with a lion's teeth and elephant eyes; Mary Carlson's crocheted works resembling splats of blood on the wall; Joyce Pensato's expressionistically painted clown face; Judith Page's ghoulish and viscous small portraits; Meredith Allen's funny and scary photographs of dogs; and a painting by Jim Torok that declares: ''You have no worries. Things are going well. Don't wake up.'' Sarah Bowen, 210 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-4517, through April 30. (Johnson)    'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson)    Last Chance    TIM BARBER A fresh, even touching reprise of the overused convention of walls papered with unframed photographs and small, cartoonish drawings, this show has been culled from Mr. Barber's Web site, tinyvices.com. With 250 people represented, it blurs the line between professional and amateur and introduces a savvy curatorial eye. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3455; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * BLUE GLAZE OF THE TANG This exceptional exhibition of Tang horses, court ladies, equestrian figures and grooms brings together rare examples of the unusually painterly sancai ware in which the traditional three-color glaze includes cobalt blue. Berwald Oriental Art, 5 East 57th Street, (212) 319-1519; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    Marcel Broodthaers This reverential exhibition of just three works by a Belgian Conceptualist regarded as a Duchampian saint in some sectors of the art world includes a hat painted white and attached to a canvas painted black and white; a work called ''L'Erreur,'' consisting of 45 eggshells attached to a canvas labeled ''moules,'' the French word for mussels; and a set of canvases neatly inscribed with words relating to the composition and sale of paintings. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    PHIL COLLINS In his third New York solo show, this British artist presents two video pieces in which interviews with Turkish reality show participants and a series of karaoke performances create a kind of ambient documentary about life, television and the pursuit of celebrity. While the show is a bit short on artistic nutrients, the cumulative effect says almost more than is bearable about the combination of delusion and oppression that fuels everyday life. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * Dan Fischer Velvety graphite drawings copied from Xerox copies of book and magazine images of well-known artists like Robert Smithson and Sol LeWitt and artworks like Jeff Koons's iconic ''Rabbit'' evoke and possibly satirize the reverence that some people feel for modern and contemporary art. Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-6411; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    Daniel Johnston: 'The Story of an Artist' The nearly 70 ballpoint and felt-tip drawings by this semi-outsider artist, rock musician and 2006 Whitney Biennial pick don't live up to the hype, but they are fun to look at. In a distracted but versatile faux-adolescent style, the Texas-based Mr. Johnston creates sweet and sometimes hair-raising cartoon improvisations on themes of love, sex, hope, despair and death. Clementine, 632 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-5937; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    * FRANCIS PICABIA: 'WORKS ON PAPER, 1901-1951' Consistent with the predominantly linear, sometimes kitschy imagery of the artist's proto-postmodern transparency paintings, the 100 works on paper here reveal a lifelong involvement with drawing, marked by an indifference to notions of style, taste, consistency, skill or progress. It is both a challenge and a treat. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623; closes tomorrow.

Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212.    'GUARDIANS' Opens Tuesday. A favorite from the 2005 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, this series of monologues juxtaposes the Abu Ghraib scandal in the United States with the release by a London newspaper of forged photos of English soldiers torturing detainees. Jason Moore directs (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983.    'PEER GYNT' Opens Tuesday.

'STUFF HAPPENS' Opens Thursday. The words of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and company make up the script of David Hare's docudrama about the run-up to war (2:50).

This little-musical-that-could about an unscrupulous Broadway producer in the 1920's (some things never change) began at the Toronto Fringe Festival and now makes its unlikely premiere on the Great White Way (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.    'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' Previews start Thursday. Opens April 27. Redemption is a major theme of this musical fantasy adapted from a Peter S. Beagle novel about a recluse who lives in a Bronx cemetery (2:00). York Theater, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444.    'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' Opens April 16. John Guare, never satisfied with an overly tidy play, throws comedy, tragedy, satire and mystery into this cult drama, which first opened almost three decades ago. Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott star (2:15). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.    'LESTAT' Opens April 25.

If any Broadway theater was made for a revival of Brecht's classic, it's the cabaret-style Studio 54, which will be host to an intriguing cast that includes Alan Cumming and Cyndi Lauper (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300.    'THE WEDDING SINGER' Opens April 27. Stephen Lynch plays the goofy title character in this musical adaptation of the Adam Sandler film about leg warmers, Billy Idol and other artifacts from the 1980's. John Rando (''Urinetown'') directs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed by with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)    'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Closing Sunday. Moving to Broadway. Previews begin April 19; opens May 3 at the Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NIGHT IN NOVEMBER'  A soccer game in Belfast is a catalyst for personal transformation in Marie Jones's tour de force two-act monologue. Marty Maguire throws himself into the revival of this well-written, funny piece with an abandon that verges on hysteria. (1:30). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    'PEN'  David Marshall Grant's sometimes preachy new three-character play is about an unhappy Long Island family in 1969. J. Smith-Cameron is fascinating to watch as she exposes the anguish behind the tough, angry exterior of the wheelchair-bound mother; Dan McCabe is uneven but believable as the troubled teenage son who wants to get away from her; and Reed Birney is less persuasive as the ex-husband who has already left. The title object is a gift from the author to himself: it allows something impossible to happen. (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE PROPERTY KNOWN AS GARLAND' Adrienne Barbeau as Judy, backstage on the night of her last concert in Copenhagen. Billy Van Zandt's play is tawdry and dull, and Ms. Barbeau's performance offers neither the minor rewards of a decent impersonation nor the guilty pleasures of an indecent one. (1:30). The Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Goes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condi Rice, is casual to the point of offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)    * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON'  A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore)    Off Off Broadway    'BURIED CHILD' Tom Herman's revival makes something known new by revealing how close Sam Shepard's play about a dysfunctional Midwest family is to tragic opera, speechlike arias included. The Michael Chekhov Theater Company is presenting 45 Shepard plays, and this first effort sounds a positive note. (2:30) Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Stevens)    'WE USED TO GO OUT' Jason Mantzoukas and Jessica St. Clair revive the tradition of male-female comedy team in this appealing sketch about a disintegrating romance (1:00). UCB Theater, 306 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176. (Jason Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton,(212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico García Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' A pair of interlocking monologues surrounding a little parody of an opera, with text by Wallace Shawn and music by his brother Allen. Written two decades ago and shelved when the authors failed to find a producer, this is a minor-key, underrealized work that hits a few elegiac notes but steps too gingerly around the psychosexual trauma at its core (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'TRIAL BY WATER'  Qui Nguyen, raising worthwhile questions about how to live a humane and moral life in the real world, has based his play on the experiences of a cousin who survived a voyage of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea that ended in murder and cannibalism. Though the actors are not able to surmount the play's unfortunate didacticism and melodrama, Clint Ramos's stunning wooden set does. (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. ( Stevens)    * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)'  O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; closing Sunday. (212) 352-3101.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by clichés and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger)    'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)    'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis)    'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Dana Stevens)    * 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who co-stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)    * 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden)    'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)    * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)    'LONESOME JIM' (R, 91 minutes) Steve Buscemi directed this deadpan comedy about a depressed 27-year-old writer (Casey Affleck) who returns from New York in defeat to his childhood home in rural Indiana and takes a job in his parents' ladder factory. (Holden)    'MARILYN HOTCHKISS BALLROOM DANCING AND CHARM SCHOOL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) John Goodman plays a dying crash victim on his way to a 40-year-old appointment, and Robert Carlyle is the widowed baker entrusted with keeping it. Instead he meets Marisa Tomei, who teaches him to dance and, more important, throw away his wife's ashes. Toggling back and forth between past and present, ''Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School'' is a soggy, endless wallow in nostalgia and the healing power of very bad dancing. (Catsoulis)    * 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)    'TORO NEGRO' (No rating, 87 minutes, in Spanish) A disturbed young matador stabs animals, beats his wife and drinks himself to the edge of oblivion in this harrowing, deeply suspect documentary set in rural Mexico. (Nathan Lee)    * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)    'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)    'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)    * 'YANG BAN XI: THE 8 MODEL WORKS' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Mandarin) In her documentary about Chinese propaganda of the campiest kind (think rosy-cheeked, chubby-kneed dancers leaping across the stage, guns clutched in one hand, Little Red Books in the other), the director Yan-Ting Yuen revisits the Cultural Revolution to explore the history and legacy of one of the strangest byproducts of totalitarian madness: the revolutionary spectacular. (Dargis)    * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or a turnoff. (Dargis)    Film Series    AGAINST THE TIDE: REBELS & MAVERICKS IN CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE FILM (Through April 16) Japan Society's spring film series, which began yesterday, continues this weekend with films including ''Wild Berries'' (2003), Miwa Nishikawa's satire of Japanese family values; and ''Kaza-hana'' (2001), the director Shinji Somai's last work, a drama about a bureaucrat and a young widow trying to redefine their damaged lives. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258; $10. (Anita Gates)    PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. ''Paris Awakens'' (1991), Olivier Assayas's drama about alienated urban teenage lovers, will be shown tomorrow. Judith Godrèche and Thomas Langmann star. (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    RECENT FILMS FROM DENMARK (Through April 19) Scandinavia House continues its overall Scandinavian film series with Rumle Hammerich's ''Young Andersen'' (2005), the story of Hans Christian Andersen's encounter, at the age of 18, with a difficult school principal. 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates)    A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUL: THE COMPLETE KIESLOWSKI (Through April 23) To honor the 10th anniversary of Krzysztof Kieslowski's death, the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the Polish National Film Archive and the Polish Cultural Institute in New York are presenting a retrospective of his work. This weekend's films include ''The Calm'' (1976), about an ex-convict and a workers' strike; ''The Double Life of Veronique'' (1991); and all three parts of the Colors trilogy: ''Blue'' (1993), ''White'' (1994) and ''Red'' (1994). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    DON SIEGEL (Through Thursday) Siegel, who died in 1991, was a master of several genres, including science fiction, westerns and police thrillers. Film Forum's four-week, 25-movie retrospective of his work concludes with a weeklong run of ''Dirty Harry'' (1971), his biggest hit. This is Clint Eastwood's first and best interpretation of Harry Callahan, a tough San Francisco cop who has been known to ask deserving punks whether they're feeling lucky. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)    VILLAGE VOICE BEST OF 2005 (Through April 26) This annual series, which opened yesterday, continues this weekend with three films. ''Funny Ha Ha'' (2003), Andrew Bujalski's debut feature, is a study of post-college life. Claire Denis's ''Intruder'' (2004) is a drama about a dying man. ''The Sun'' (2005), a portrait of Emperor Hirohito (Issei Ogata), completes Aleksandr Sokurov's dictator trilogy. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    SHELLEY WINTERS VS. THE WATER (Through April 25) Beginning on Wednesday, BAMcinématek honors Winters, who died in January at 83, with screenings of four of her best-known films. Tuesday night's feature is ''The Night of the Hunter'' (1955), Charles Laughton's noir thriller with Robert Mitchum as a criminal pretending to be a preacher and Winters as his unsuspecting, doomed new wife. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with Robert Florey's ''Daughter of Shanghai'' (1937), a thriller about a woman avenging her father's murder; Florey's ''Dangerous to Know'' (1938), based on Wong's Broadway play about a mobster's girlfriend; and Nick Grinde's ''King of Chinatown'' (1939), about a Chinese-American surgeon (Wong) who saves a criminal's life. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    YOLANDA ADAMS (Tomorrow) Blending gospel and rhythm-and-blues, Yolanda Adams has a powerful voice, though it is used more for purposes of warm inspiration and uplifting solace than quasi-sexual shudders of praise. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Midtown, (212) 997-4144; $65. (Laura Sinagra)    EVA AYLLON (Tomorrow) Eva Ayllon is a stadium-filling star in Peru who, for more than 30 years, has placed her own stamp on the Afro-Peruvian folk heritage: songs with crisp syncopations played on instruments as basic as the box drum called the cajón. She adds a husky voice that never shies away from drama. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824; $25 to $45. (Jon Pareles)    ANTI-FLAG (Thursday) You can't accuse this politically minded punk band of flip-flopping on the issues. Sure, it moved to the center on the subject of corporate record labels, but it still has lots of leftist bile to spew about topics like the lazy news media (''The Press Corpse''), big trade (''The W.T.O. Kills Farmers'') and plain old greed (''1 Trillion Dollar$''). 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $15.75 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    ASHA BHOSLE (Tomorrow) Ms. Bhosle is famous as a vocalist for Indian film. Here she performs reinterpreted Bollywood classics accompanied by the Kronos Quartet, with Zakir Hussaino on the tabla, and Wu Man on pipa. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 501-1390; $21 to $72. (Sinagra)    NEKO CASE (Tonight) The clarion voice that's best known as the transcendent secret weapon of the Canadian pop group New Pornographers belongs to this alt-country chanteuse, who performs her own songs here. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)    KEYSHIA COLE (Tomorrow)The R&B singer Keyshia Cole presents a tough-cookie brand of diva soul that focuses less on fashionista posing than on righteous recrimination. On her single ''I Changed My Mind,'' she rides Kanye West's hard-clapping track with sultry grit. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171. Sold out. (Sinagra)    DONNA THE BUFFALO (Tomorrow) Donna the Buffalo is not named after its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins. Its good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country music, though it also dips into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. 6:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50. (Pareles)    FRANZ FERDINAND, DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE (Thursday) At the vanguard of the post-post-punk trend, the poker-faced group Franz Ferdinand plays herky-jerky party music. Death Cab is a decorous diarist-rock band whose sound took on some added alternative-rock heft on its most recent album, ''Plans'' (Atlantic). 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, garment district, (212) 485-1534; $40 in advance, $45 at the door. (Sinagra)    GOGOL BORDELLO (Wednesday) Led by a gruff and extravagantly mustached Ukrainian singer, Eugene Hutz, Gogol Bordello calls itself a Gypsy punk band. Translating Eastern European cabaret to the Lower East Side, its songs work up to a frenetic oompah that's the makings of a rowdy party. 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $22. (Pareles)    HEARTLESS BASTARDS, THE SOLEDAD BROTHERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Because of her primal yowl, the singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom is often compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. The hungry stomp of her power trio, Heartless Bastards, is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. The members switch off headlining slots with the Soledad Brothers. 10:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12. (Sinagra)    THE HOLD STEADY, P.O.S. (Tonight) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady savant Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. The indie-rapper P.O.S. also performs. 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $16.50. (Sinagra)    THE iO'S (Tuesday) Just like the Canadian band Stars, the iO's remind you of that exuberant 90's moment when bands like Mavis Piggott and Madder Rose made it seem that smart girl voices over big guitars were the way of the future. The iO's have a guy singer, too. But as in Stars, the female voice is the more affecting. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    TALIB KWELI (Tonight) This brainy rapper's agile attack still lacks Jigga's precision, 50 Cent's swagger and Nas's anguish. But his rapping can be beautiful when he laments things like Lauryn Hill's exit from the music scene. 8 p.m., Pratt Institute Student Union, 200 Willoughby Avenue, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, (718) 636-3422; free for Pratt students, $4 for nonstudents. (Sinagra)    KYP MALONE (Tomorrow) With his ethereal falsetto and coronal afro, Kyp Malone is known to many as a vocalist and guitarist in the spacy local band TV on the Radio. For years, though, he was a fixture on San Francisco's indie scene. Lately he's been doing his own thing. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $8. (Sinagra)    McCULLOUGH SONGS OF THUNDER, THE BIRMINGHAM SUNLIGHTS (Tomorrow) The 16-piece ''shout'' gospel brass band, McCullough Songs of Thunder, from the United House of Prayer for All People in Harlem, aims to blare its devotion so loudly and joyously that the angels have to sing along. They are joined here by the Birmingham Sunlights, a traditional a cappella gospel group. 8 p.m., Harlem Center for the Performing Arts, Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100; Free. (Sinagra)    SUSAN McKEOWN (Tonight) Susan McKeown interprets Irish traditionals with a distinctive intensity. Accompanying her here are some musicians who play on her most recent recording: the fiddler Dana Lyn and the guitarist Eamon O'Leary. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15. (Sinagra)    BETH ORTON (Tuesday) Though her voice, which recalls the best of the English folk tradition, should be enough to put her songs across, the quality of Ms. Orton's work has often depended on her adept collaborations. Her most recent is with the post-rock gadfly Jim O'Rourke. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Sold out. (Sinagra)    QUASI (Monday and Tuesday) Sam Coomes and his ex-wife, the Sleater-Kinney drummer Janet Weiss, make tempestuous indie-rock that veers toward apocalypse blues. Monday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $12 in advance , $14 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE RACONTEURS (Tonight) Jack White of the White Stripes and the power-pop talent Brendan Benson team up with members of the Greenhorns in this assertive side project. They play garage-rock cut with incisive pop hooks. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Sold out. (Sinagra)    RJD2, BEANS (Tonight) Representing an offshoot of the record-store scavenging D.J. tradition exemplified in the 1990's by the likes of DJ Shadow, RJD2 takes a cinematic approach. The rapper Beans, formerly of Antipop Consortium, has made a solo career out of meshing his surreal lyrics with the work of electronic-rock artists and culture-hopping D.J.'s. 9, Guggenheim Auditorium, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500; $20 (cash at door only, free for members).(Sinagra)    JOSH ROUSE (Tonight) This confessional singer-songwriter gives contemplative navel-gazing a Nashville twist. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824; $22.50 to $26.50. (Sinagra)    SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Sunday) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722;$17 to $50. (Pareles)    THE SOUNDS, MORNINGWOOD (Wednesday) The Sounds are a Swedish band that plays sugar-sharp arena pop with a pinch of bad-girl sass. Morningwood is more punky, though somehow less authentic. 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    REGINA SPEKTOR (Tuesday) The Russian-born singer and pianist Regina Spektor brings punk immediacy into a cabaret setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and unhinged melodrama. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sinagra)    KREMENA STANCHEVA (Tomorrow) Ms. Stancheva is a member of Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, the Bulgarian vocal group that created one of world music's first minibooms in the late 1980's. She has been with the group for 45 years. This concert and folklore presentation allows her to apply her many years of Bulgarian song scholarship. 8 p.m., Bulgarian Consulate General, 121 East 62nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 935-4646; $15. (Sinagra)    THE SWORD (Tonight and Sunday) The Texans in the Sword do a great approximation of Black Sabbath's slow menace, at points also revealing hard-core punk underpinnings with thrash bravura. Tonight at 8:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J.,(201) 653-1703; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. Sunday at 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village; (212) 982-4052; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    TINARIWEN (Tonight) This guitar band from the deserts of Mali turns Tuareg culture's acoustic music into a chant-based kind of distended electric blues, addressing the issues of exile, displacement and poverty. 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)    WOLFMOTHER (Tuesday) Part of a wave of what's been dubbed ''heritage metal,'' the Australian trio Wolfmother strives to sound like Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Sold out. (Sinagra)    WOLF PARADE (Sunday and Monday) Part of Montreal's wave of ''It'' art-pop bands that includes Arcade Fire and Unicorns, Wolf Parade has a Northern noir take on keyboard-heavy epics. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Sold out.(Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)    BABY JANE DEXTER (Tomorrow) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)    ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ALPHABET LOUNGE BIG BAND (Sunday) Led by the pianist Deidre Rodman, this large ensemble expands on the mischievous eclecticism of the Jazz Passengers, with a lineup that includes Kate McGarry on vocals; Roy Nathanson, Ohad Talmor and Jay Rodriguez on saxophones; Sam Bardfeld on violin; and Curtis Fowlkes on trombone. 6 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)    MICHAEL BLAKE TRIO (Tonight) Pulse and texture shift perpetually in this trio, thanks to the earthy rhythm team of Ben Allison and Jeff Ballard, on bass and drums; but the group's capricious tone is set by Mr. Blake, on tenor and soprano saxophones. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    GARY BURTON'S GENERATIONS (Wednesday through April 15) Mr. Burton, the extravagantly proficient vibraphonist, educator and composer, features younger talent exclusively in this ensemble, reserving a central role for the teenage guitar prodigy Julian Lage. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    BILLY CHILDS CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Wednesday through April 16) The pianist and composer Billy Childs favors a billowy sound that often drifts perilously close to New Age. But behind a genteel front line of piano, saxophone, harp and guitar lurks the action-oriented rhythm team of Scott Colley on bass and Antonio Sanchez on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with 11:30 sets Fridays and Saturdays, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25, $30 Fridays and Saturdays. (Chinen)    LOU DONALDSON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Bebop, blues and boogaloo are all fair game for the veteran alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who receives strong support here from Dr. Lonnie Smith on Hammond B-3 organ, Randy Johnston on guitar and Fukushi Tainaka on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    SHANE ENDSLEY GROUP (Monday) An ethereal sense of groove guides this chamber ensemble, which enfolds Mr. Endsley's trumpet in a dark cocoon of Fender Rhodes piano, vibraphone, guitar, bass and drums. Sharing the bill is Common Thread, a flintier band featuring Mr. Endsley but led by another trumpeter, Jonathan Finlayson. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)    GOOD FOR COWS (Tonight and tomorrow) The bassist Devin Hoff and the drummer Ches Smith constitute this Bay Area duo, which interrogates jazz and punk with equal rigor. Tonight they share the bill with another duo, Sonar, from Brooklyn; tomorrow their second set will feature a special guest, the pianist Vijay Iyer. Tonight at 8, Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; cover, $10.

(Chinen)    JON GORDON QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Gordon, an accomplished alto and soprano saxophonist, projects standards through a slightly warped lens, with the help of Mike Moreno on guitar, Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. 10, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $20. (Chinen)    * BARRY HARRIS AND REGINA CARTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Harris, one of bebop's stalwart pianists, and Ms. Carter, a violinist of sleek composure, both hail from Detroit, a fact that has some bearing on this concert of newly commissioned music, featuring each artist with a separate ensemble. 8, Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $105.50 and $135.50. (Chinen)    BILLY HART QUARTET (Tuesday through April 16) Mr. Hart, a loose but focused drummer with a sterling résumé, fronts a dream team of younger players: the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the bassist Ben Street. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    WILL HOLSHOUSER TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Holshouser is an accordionist in tune with his instrument's folk legacy, but hardly constricted by it; his longstanding trio, with the trumpeter Ron Horton and the bassist David Phillips, manages a playful sort of melancholy. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    STANLEY JORDAN TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Jordan applies a distinctive tapping technique to the fretboard of his guitar, producing a harmonic range more suggestive of pianism. His rhythm section consists of Zirque Bonner on bass and Ed Barattini on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30 tonight and tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)    STEVE LEHMAN GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Lehman, an intense young saxophonist, features his own sharp-cornered compositions in this ensemble, which derives much of its heft from the drumming of Tyshawn Sorey. Wednesday at 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. Thursday at 8 and 10 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    JIMMY McGRIFF GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) A powerfully bluesy presence on the Hammond B-3 organ since the early 1960's, Mr. McGriff marked his 70th birthday earlier this week and continues the celebration here. 9 and 11 p.m., and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)    CHARNETT MOFFETT (Monday) Mr. Moffett may be a few years late with his new album, ''Internet'' (Piadrum), but his bass playing is characteristically solid, and he surrounds himself with good musicians -- in this case, the alto saxophonist Vincent Herring, the pianist Mulgrew Miller and the drummer Eric McPherson. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $10 at tables with a $5 minimum or $5 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    GRACHAN MONCUR III BAND (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Moncur was one of the first trombonists to make sense of free improvisation, compellingly, in the 1960's; this modern ensemble includes such kindred adventurers as the saxophonists Billy Harper and Michael Blake and the pianist John Hicks. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    PAUL MOTIAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) The teasingly suggestive drumming of Mr. Motian is just one of several enigmas posed by this ensemble, which is also distinguished by the tightly coiled alto saxophone scribbles of Greg Osby and the abstruse pianism of Masabumi Kikuchi. Larry Grenadier, on bass, serves a welcome clarifying purpose. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    * DAVID MURRAY QUARTET/ODEAN POPE SAXOPHONE CHOIR (Through Sunday) In terms of sheer saxophone bluster, it would be tough to conjure a weightier double bill than this one, which pairs the avant-garde tenor titan David Murray (with Lafayette Gilchrist on piano, Jaribu Shahid on bass and Hamid Drake on drums) and Odean Pope's signature ensemble (nine saxophones, including Mr. Pope, and a rhythm section). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    SAXOPHONE SUMMIT (Tuesday through April 16) The alto saxophonist Charles McPherson has always nursed a fondness for Charlie Parker's blistering bebop, so his role in this Parker tribute makes perfect sense. So does the supporting cast: Tom Harrell on trumpet, Ronnie Mathews on piano, Ray Drummond on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (For NYC & Company discount, (212) 484-1222.) (Chinen)    SKIRL RECORDS LAUNCH PARTY (Tuesday) Skirl is an independent label with the stated objective of documenting new music by a Brooklyn-centered cadre of musicians. The first three bands on its roster will perform here: the Clarinets, featuring Anthony Burr, Oscar Noriega and Chris Speed (the label's founder); Ted Reichman's My Ears Are Bent; and Curtis Hasselbring's New Mellow Edwards. Also on hand is a pair of bands with Skirl releases in the foreseeable future: Tyft (Hilmar Jensson on guitar, Andrew D'Angelo on reeds and Jim Black on drums) and Mr. Noriega's trio (with Trevor Dunn on bass and Tom Rainey on drums). 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)    GRANT STEWART QUINTET (Tuesday) A big-toned tenor saxophonist in the hard bop mainstream, with a fine ensemble, including the pianist Bill Charlap and the guitarist Peter Bernstein. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    * HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Through Sunday) The august composer and multi-reedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre; in this superb ensemble, his flute and alto saxophone are flanked by cello, oud, acoustic guitar, tuba, trombone and drums. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $20 (Chinen)    ERNIE WATTS-LEW SOLOFF QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Watts, a Los Angeles-based saxophonist, and Mr. Soloff, a New York trumpeter, present a formidable partnership, especially in the presence of Mulgrew Miller on piano, François Moutin on bass, and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. 8, 10and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. A mostly new cast has taken over, with Yunah Lee as Mimi, Gerard Powers as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black as Musetta, and Philip Torre as Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $45 and $79. (Jeremy Eichler)    'CARMEN' (Tonight, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) City Opera seems to be finishing its season with a new emphasis on voice. This ''Carmen'' looks as if it is worth hearing, with the strong mezzo Kate Aldrich in the title role, and the soprano Laquita Mitchell making her company debut as Micaëla. Robert Breault has already shown he has a strong if unvaried voice as Alfredo in ''La Traviata;'' let's see what he offers in a heavier part, Don José. George Manahan conducts. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 tickets remaining tonight; $45 on Sunday; and $65 to $120 on Tuesday and Thursday. (Anne Midgette)    'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow) A largely decent cast helps bring across Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Elizabeth Caballero, new to the company, is a feisty Donna Elvira who utters little squeaks of indignation when she's not pouring out her heart in melisma; Yeghishe Manucharyan shows his white-toned tenor to advantage as Don Ottavio. Alas, Christopher Schaldenbrand, a talented singer, has not quite grown into the demanding title role. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $25. (Midgette)    'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Amato's venerable recipe -- no rehearsals, changing casts at every performance -- should make for an unusual version of Mozart's classic, but at least the theater's small scale represents a kind of period fidelity. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)    * 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he has accomplished this vividly. He taps into the emotions -- jealousy, yearning, fear of death -- that swirl below the surface of this farcical tale about a crusty and miserly bachelor who foolishly decides to take a young wife and disinherit his shiftless nephew. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko; the robust, dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien; and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Maurizio Benini conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $70 to $205 tickets remaining tonight; $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)    * 'FIDELIO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Jürgen Flimm's strikingly contemporary and deeply humane production, which opened at the Met in 2000, is back. So is the soprano Karita Mattila, who gives a courageous and vocally radiant portrayal of Leonore, opera's most valiant and devoted wife. The conductor Paul Nadler has taken over for James Levine, who has withdrawn for the rest of the season, and though Mr. Nadler is no Levine, he does honorable work. All in all, this production still delivers. And Ms. Mattila is astonishing. Erika Sunnegardh, who recently made her Met debut as Leonore when Ms. Mattila was ill, sings in the last performance on Thursday. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Tommasini)    'MANON' (Tomorrow) The news is Renée Fleming, who closes out the run of a signature role in this venerable but appealing Jean-Pierre Ponnelle production, along with the tenor Massimo Giordano, under the baton of Jesús López-Cobos. Not news is the length of this grand opera; after hearing an opera by Massenet, a notable dramatic soprano is supposed to have said, ''And they say Wagner is long?'' 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, but returns may be available. (Midgette)    'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's 1998 production, now directed by Robin Guarino, has the virtue of letting Mozart's music and Da Ponte's libretto work their magic unhindered. The Met has assembled a strong cast that includes Andrea Rost as Susanna, John Relyea as Figaro, Alice Coote as Cherubino, Soile Isokoski as the Countess, and Peter Mattei as the Count. Mark Wigglesworth conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Allan Kozinn)    'LA TRAVIATA' (Monday) The Met's first-rate revival is back again with Hei-Kyung Hong, Frank Lopardo and Dwayne Croft in the major roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets, $175. (Bernard Holland)    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Gather all ye Anglophiles.

(Holland)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) A weekly presenter of chamber music performances, this floating concert hall also offers great views of Lower Manhattan. Tonight the pianists Gerald Robbins and Katya Mihailova play Mozart, Schubert, Brahms, Dvorak and Shostakovich. Tomorrow and Sunday, Mark Peskanov and colleagues team up for Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet along with Beethoven and Mozart. Thursday brings the pianist Dmitri Alexeev in Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, Scriabin and Rachmaninoff. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Eichler)    ELIOT FISK AND PACO PEÑA (Monday) Eliot Fisk, the great, high-energy classical guitarist, and Paco Peña, the fine flamenco player, join forces for a recital that includes music by Albéniz, Falla, Rodrigo, Granados, Paganini, Scarlatti, Mendelssohn and Bach, as well as Mr. Peña's own works. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $45. (Kozinn)    VADIM GLUZMAN (Tonight) This violinist's program goes all the way from Mozart to Castelnuovo-Tedesco. 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $25. (Holland)    GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri is soldiering through another season as the de facto quartet in residence at the Met Museum. Each of the group's concerts features a Mozart chamber composition, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Clarinet Quintet (with David Shifrin), as well as Arriaga's Quartet No. 2 and Dohnanyi's Quartet in A minor. 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler)    JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) Gerard Schwarz, a hometown conductor heard less in New York these days, conducts the Juilliard's young professional-quality players in Mahler, David Diamond and Behzad Ranjbaran, with the violinist William Harvey. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)    * KRONOS QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) This ensemble's wide-ranging ''Live Mix'' series continues with two concerts in which the boundaries between classical, pop and world music are exceedingly porous. Tonight the quartet plays works by Glenn Branca, best known for his huge electric guitar symphonies, as well as ones by Terry Riley, a founder of Minimalism; the eclectic rock composer J. G. Thirlwell; and the pipa virtuoso Wu Man. Tomorrow the quartet, with the Indian singer Asha Bhosle and the tabla player Zakir Hussain, plays music by the Icelandic band Sigur Ros and the composers Derek Charke, Ram Narayan and Rahul Dev Burman. Tonight at 7:30 at Zankel Hall, tomorrow at 8 p.m. at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35 tonight, $21 to $72 tomorrow. (Kozinn)    MIAMI STRING QUARTET (Sunday) This excellent group, in residence at the Hartt School in Connecticut, has been admirably committed to contemporary music. But this time, in the essential (and affordable) Peoples' Symphony Concerts series, the quartet is playing works by Haydn, Schumann and Sibelius. ''Intimate Voices,'' the Sibelius quartet, is a deeply personal and hauntingly eclectic work, and may strike some as a bolder score than many works of more recent decades. 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 and $11. (Tommasini)    NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leonard Slatkin made a superb recording of John Corigliano's powerful Symphony No. 1 during his years with the St. Louis Symphony, and he is taking it up again with the National Symphony. The program also includes Elgar's Introduction and Allegro (Op. 47) and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Emanuel Ax. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today) The orchestra spotlights talent from among its own ranks, with the concertmaster Glenn Dicterow performing Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3, and the principal trumpet player Philip Smith as the soloist in Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's ''American Concerto.'' Bramwell Tovey conducts, adding a Mozart overture and Franck's Symphony. 11 a.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76. (Eichler)    PEABODY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) The prestigious Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore regularly sends its impressive student ensemble on tour to make music and spread the word about the institution. With its music director, Hajime Teri Murai, the orchestra plays an adventurous program with New York premieres of works by Christopher Theofanidis and Michael Hersch; Paquito D'Rivera's ''Gran Danzon'' (a flute concerto); and Mahler's mighty ''Das Lied von der Erde.'' 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $18. (Tommasini)    * ROTTERDAM PHILHARMONIC (Sunday and Monday) The first installments of Valery Gergiev's cycle of Shostakovich's symphonies, with the Kirov Orchestra last month, were both invigorating and revelatory. Mr. Gergiev takes up the project with the Rotterdam Philharmonic, with contributions on Sunday from the Riverside Choral Society and the Rutgers University Kirkpatrick Choir. The programs include the Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 on Sunday, and Nos. 5 and 15 on Monday. Sunday at 3 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Kozinn)    * 'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's humble, eloquent staging strips Bach's masterpiece to its humane core. No sets, no costumes -- just casually dressed musicians sitting in a circle, and soloists singing in English. Paul Goodwin conducts Rufus Müller, Curtis Streetman, Krisztina Szabo, Suzie LeBlanc, Daniel Taylor, Nils Brown and Stephen Varcoe. Tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $30 to $90. (Eichler)    ANDREAS SCHOLL (Tuesday) Countertenors are on the rise, and Mr. Scholl is one of the fastest-rising of the bunch, with a rounded, fluty instrument and a definite flair in how he sings with it. His program is a potpourri, ranging from the late Middle Ages to Haydn and Mozart. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Midgette)    TRIBECA NEW MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday) ''Music of the Avant-Pop'' is the title for this disparate festival of four concerts extending through May, presented by the avowedly eclectic New York Art Ensemble. This first concert focuses on ''Generation Y,'' with five so-called emerging composers exploring various permutations of acoustic and electronic instruments. 7 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; $15; $10 for students and 65+.

(Dunning)    JOHN PASSAFIUME DANCERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) A protégé of Paul Sanasardo and a former dancer with Anna Sokolow, Mr. Passafiume's new ''Fissures,'' inspired by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, examines the way everyday events can cause fault lines in our perceptions of ourselves.

Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, www.joyce.org; $40.

The free discussion initiates a new series of performances and residencies, sponsored by Barnard College and the Williamsburg Art neXus, whose focus is to return women to their former place in the American modern dance they founded. 7:30 p.m., 202 Altschul Hall, Barnard College campus, Broadway and 117th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-2995. (Dunning)    TRINAYAN COLLECTIVE (Thursday) This New York-based company of Indian classical dancers will explore the notion of the witness in ''Sakshi/Witness,'' a dance in the Odissi style.

(Dunning)    KEVIN WYNN COLLECTION (Tonight through Sunday) Known for his high-energy, fast-sweeping group pieces, Mr. Wynn will present ''Tracing Sirocco,'' which he describes as a ''hallucinogenic ensemble work for 16 dancers'' that is set in an African desert and danced to a soundscape by Luna Reyes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, www.smartix.com; $18. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)    * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)    * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)    * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)    Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)    THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)    THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)    NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through April 24. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally-savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot . 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    * FRANCIS PICABIA: 'WORKS ON PAPER, 1901-1951' Consistent with the predominantly linear, sometimes kitschy imagery of the artist's proto-postmodern transparency paintings, the 100 works on paper here reveal a lifelong involvement with drawing, marked by an indifference to notions of style, taste, consistency, skill or progress. It is both a challenge and a treat. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through April 15. (Smith)    '1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab he was working in. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)    RECENT PAINTINGS BY QIN FENG Working in ink and tea on silk-cotton paper, this 45-year-old Chinese artist continues the long tradition of Chinese calligraphy and ink painting, with assists from Japanese sumi-ink painting and Abstract Expressionists like Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. Goedhius Contemporary, 42 East 76th Street, (212) 535-6934, through April 17. (Smith).    Galleries: 57th Street    Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)    'REFLECTIONS OF GODS' Ensconced in a small, chapel-like gallery, this exhibition of nine sacred objects and one hanging screen includes a beautiful 16th-century mask and a 12th-century carved wood sculpture of a Shinto deity holding a Buddhist wish-granting jewel. Mika Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-3900, through April 15. (Smith)    * 'SPRING MIST FROM SNOW' This veritable wonder cabinet of furniture, objects and artworks conjures up the rarefied realm of the Chinese scholar's study but also represents other Asian cultures. One stand-out is a Qing wish-granting scepter in carved boxwood that must be among the fountainheads of Art Nouveau; its provenance is listed as ''an old French collection.'' William Lipton Ltd., 41 East 57th Street, (212) 751-8131, through April 15. (Smith)    Galleries: Chelsea    Tara Donovan Known for creating improbable accumulations of ordinary things, Ms. Donovan here has arranged three million plastic cups in stacks from ankle-high to five feet. They make a 50-by-60-foot rectangle on the floor, resembling a lumpy field of snow. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-7000, through April 22. (Johnson)    * Dan Fischer Velvety graphite drawings copied from Xerox copies of book and magazine images of well-known artists like Robert Smithson and Sol LeWitt and artworks like Jeff Koons's iconic ''Rabbit'' evoke and possibly satirize the reverence that some people feel for modern and contemporary art. Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, through April 15. (Johnson)    'Great Performance: Contemporary Chinese Photography' This group show updates the careers of artists who gained notice in the 1990's and gives some exposure to others who are still unfamiliar here. The real find is work by two women, Yin Xiuzhen and the formidable young performance artist Chen Qiulin. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999, through April 15. (Cotter)    Anthony James Call it Industrial Surrealist Chic. Mr. James's works include old heavy-duty power tools displayed in gleaming, mirrored cases; a glass case of white birch tree trunks that seems to extend infinitely by virtue of two-way mirrors; and a life-size, digitally copied female nude of laser-cut aluminum. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, (212) 367-9093, through April 15. (Johnson)    Daniel Johnston: 'The Story of an Artist' The nearly 70 ballpoint and felt-tip drawings by this semi-outsider artist and rock musician and 2006 Whitney Biennial pick don't live up to the hype, but they are fun to look at. In a distracted but versatile, faux-adolescent style, the Texas-based Mr. Johnston creates sweet and sometimes hair-raising cartoon improvisations on themes of love, sex, hope, despair and death. Clementine, 632 West 27th Street, (212) 243-5937, through April 15. (Johnson)    Eve K. Tremblay: 'Tales Without Grounds' A rising young Canadian photographer presents glossy staged photographs of people doing enigmatic things in and around a large facility for hydroponic lettuce cultivation. With their cinematically intense colors, Ms. Tremblay's pictures are like stills from a Tarkovskian science fiction movie. Buia, 541 West 23rd Street, (212) 366-9915, through April 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    TIM BARBER A fresh, even touching reprise of the overused convention of walls papered with unframed photographs and small cartoonish drawings, this show has been culled from Mr. Barber's Web site, tinyvices.com. With 250 people represented, it blurs the line between professional and amateur and introduces a savvy curatorial eye. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through April 15. (Smith)    Marcel Broodthaers This reverential exhibition of just three works by a Belgian Conceptualist regarded as a Duchampian saint in some sectors of the art world includes a hat painted white and attached to a canvas painted black and white; a work called ''L'Erreur,'' consisting of 45 eggshells attached to a canvas labeled ''moules,'' the French word for mussels; and a set of canvases neatly inscribed with words relating to the composition and sale of paintings. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through April 15. (Johnson)    Rico Gatson: 'African Fractals' Mr. Gatson's suave geometric paintings and sculptures of symbolically charged vernacular objects -- a whipping post in the form of a Christian cross with wrist-holes, for example -- feature African-style stripe patterns, creating a dialogue between utopian Modernism and tragic social history. A video installation produces hypnotic patterns out of films of the pageantry surrounding the great boxing match between Muhammed Ali and George Foreman that took place in Zaire in 1974. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through April 22. (Johnson)    Joëlle Tuerlinckx: 'Drawing Inventory' A prominent Belgian conceptualist presents a dry and oblique installation consisting of a large quantity of ordinary materials more or less related to the art of drawing. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through April 22. (Johnson)    Last Chance    * 'ARTS OF ANCIENT CHINA' A museum-quality selection that begins with an elegant Neolithic red pottery bowl includes rare examples of early lacquer and is especially notable for its profusion of bronze vessels and objects. J. J. Lally, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 371-3380; closes Wednesday. (Smith)    THIERRY DE CORDIER AND PIERRE HUYGHE Mr. de Cordier's ''Female Drawings'' evoke blurred, semi-abstract Madonnas and also the recherché style of postwar European figuration. Mr. Huyghe's puppet video, ''This is Not a Time for Dreaming,'' which ruminates on, and was commissioned for, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard -- suffers from obscurity, but is still one of the most beautiful videos made in recent years. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 581-5187; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * REALM OF THE GODS: ART FROM INDIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA A lavish display of sculptures of Hindu deities and Buddhist monks offers excellent examples of several of India's dynastic and regional styles in bronze, sandstone and terra cotta, along with works from Thailand, Cambodia, Mongolia and, especially, Tibet. Carlton Rochell, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7600; closes today. (Smith)    Charlotta Westergren: 'Ahus Sommaren 1974' Preoccupied by her family and ancestry, Ms. Westergren presents a James Turrell-like room with artificial aroma added, designed to simulate the light and smell of a summer home in Sweden. She also presents Swedish wildflowers made of sugar by a professional confectioner and her own reprisals of old paintings by a beloved sister who once aspired to become an artist. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959; closes tomorrow.

Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, (212) 307-4100.    'THE WEDDING SINGER' Opens April 27.

Phil Collins lends his invisible touch to the score of the latest Disney musical. David Henry Hwang wrote the book (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100.    Broadway    'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico García Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman)    * 'CYCLONE' Some skilled actors have a fine time with Ron Fitzgerald's black comedy about a young man (Hamish Linklater) who is wandering around New Jersey, carrying his father's ashes. James Hendricks, playing his neighbor, has a second-act monologue that deserves some kind of award. (2:15) Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'FAMILY SECRETS'  Performing old jokes with meticulous detail, Sherry Glaser in her solo show brings to life three generations of a Jewish family (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman)    'FAHRENHEIT 451'  A visceral version of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, staged by the Godlight Theater Company. No, firefighters don't burn books these days, but still you end up saying, ''Dang, that man had vision.'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)    'FRAGMENT' Pavol Liska directs this assemblage of fragments from the lost works of Sophocles and Euripides, an ambitious venture featuring fine performances from Zachary Oberzan, Tony Torn and Juliana Francis. (1:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 677-4210.(George Hunka)    'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Hunka)    'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE'  The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'Living Room in Africa' Bathsheba Doran's play, presented by the Edge Theater, is the disturbing but somewhat simplistic story of an English couple's attempt to start an art gallery in a remote region in Africa -- only to discover that AIDS has gotten there first (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' A solid revival of one of Shakespeare's problem plays in which the director Beatrice Terry has opted to emphasize the humor, especially in the scenes of comic relief. A staging with handsome costumes and that for the most part boasts a fine cast, whose members have made some smart choices (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton)    'mercy on the doorstep' Religious faith faces down the allied forces of alcoholism and cynicism in Gip Hoppe's drama. Laura Esterman is terrific as a gleefully unreformed libertine whose stepdaughter has found God and come to share the good news. The play itself is mostly bad news, unfortunately: meandering, repetitive and lacking in nuance (1:45). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)    'THE PROPERTY KNOWN AS GARLAND' Adrienne Barbeau as Judy, backstage on the night of her last concert in Copenhagen. Billy Van Zandt's play is tawdry and dull, and Ms. Barbeau's performance offers neither the minor rewards of a decent impersonation nor the guilty pleasures of an indecent one. (1:30). The Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)    * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON'  A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore)    'TRIAL BY WATER'  Qui Nguyen, raising worthwhile questions about how to live a humane and moral life in the real world, has based his play on the experiences of a cousin who survived a voyage of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea that ended in murder and cannibalism. Though the actors are not able to surmount the play's unfortunate didacticism and melodrama, Clint Ramos's stunning wooden set does. (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens)    'WALK THE MOUNTAIN'  Jude Narita's one-woman show ''Walk the Mountain,'' about the hellish effects of the Vietnam War, offers nuanced accounts rather than a mere litany of horrors. (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.(Laura Weinert)    Off Off Broadway    'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'BURIED CHILD' Tom Herman's revival makes something known new by revealing how close Sam Shepard's play about a dysfunctional Midwest family is to tragic opera, speechlike arias included. The Michael Chekhov Theater Company is presenting 45 Shepard plays, and this first effort sounds a positive note. (2:30) Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Stevens)    '33 TO NOTHING' A band break up while playing break-up music in Grant James Varjas's comic, sometimes poignant play. Music performed by the actors. Argo Theater Company, at the Bottle Factory Theater, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gwen Orel)    * 'SHILOH RULES' An inventive play by Doris Baizley gets excellent treatment by the cast of six actresses. The story is set not at the Civil War Battle of Shiloh, but at a modern-day re-enactment, and by the time it's through, Ms. Baizley has served up a lot of humor and some drama, history and first-aid lessons as well. (2:05) Gene Frankel Theater, 24 Bond Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)    * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)'  O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley)    Last Chance    'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex-change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing Saturday. (Zinoman)    'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger)    'Ask the Dust' (R, 117 minutes) A story about being young and hungry -- for fame, for women, for food -- in Los Angeles during the 1930's. Robert Towne wrote and directed this adaptation of the John Fante novel, and Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek star. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)    'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis)    * 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Holden)    * 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden)    * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)    'LARRY THE CABLE GUY: HEALTH INSPECTOR' (PG-13, 89 minutes) Making his feature film debut, the blue-collar comedian known as Larry the Cable Guy (real name: Daniel Whitney) plays an unorthodox health inspector who is dispatched to investigate a series of food poisonings at upscale restaurants. Unpleasant, uncouth and painfully unfunny, ''Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector'' pursues its flatulence-based goals with a relentlessness that makes ''Dumb and Dumber'' seem the epitome of sophistication. (Catsoulis)    * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)    'LONESOME JIM' (R, 91 minutes) Steve Buscemi directed this deadpan comedy about a depressed 27-year-old writer (Casey Affleck) who returns from New York in defeat to his childhood home in rural Indiana and takes a job in his parents' ladder factory. (Holden)    'MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English, Mandarin and Fujian) A startling look at both the effects of globalization and a dramatic cultural divide among youth, David Redmon's documentary contrasts the lives of indulgent Americans intent on having a good time in New Orleans and hard-working Chinese factory workers who slave away to manufacture those brightly colored beads so fundamental to the Mardi Gras festivities. (Laura Kern)    * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)    * 'SHADOW: DEAD RIOT' (No rating, 90 minutes) An experimental women's prison is overrun by zombies in this berserk little B movie, the low-budget love child of ''The Evil Dead'' and ''Reform School Girls.'' (Nathan Lee)    'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee)    '16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis)    * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden)    'STAY ALIVE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A computer game turns out to have the power to kill things, possibly including Frankie Muniz's post-''Malcolm in the Middle'' career. The high-tech premise can't hide the horror-film clichés. (Genzlinger)    'STONED' (No rating, 102 minutes) This docudrama follows the last weeks in the life of Brian Jones, a founding member of the Rolling Stones and an androgynous, drug-addled fop, who was found dead in his swimming pool in 1969. Hedonism on the screen has rarely looked so dull. (Holden)    'SUMMER STORM' (R, 98 minutes, in German) Yet another of those soft-core, simple-minded stories about a geeky young gay man struggling with his sexuality, this banal Bavarian import is a perfect storm of barely legal titillations and genre clichés. (Lee)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)    'TORO NEGRO' (No rating, 87 minutes, in Spanish) A disturbed young matador stabs animals, beats his wife and drinks himself to the edge of oblivion in this harrowing, deeply suspect documentary set in rural Mexico. (Lee)    * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)    'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)    'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature. Directed by Kurt Wimmer with a fine eye for the preferences of 12-year-old boys, ''Ultraviolet'' cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly. (Catsoulis)    'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)    * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or a turnoff. (Dargis)    Film Series    ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with J. Elder Wills's ''Tiger Bay'' (1933), in which Wong plays a nightclub owner who protects a couple from a gang; and J. Walter Ruben's ''Java Head'' (1934), about a Chinese princess who marries an Englishman and follows him back to Bristol. 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates)    DON SIEGEL (Through April 13) Mr. Siegel, who died in 1991, was a master of several genres, including science fiction, westerns and police thrillers. Film Forum's four-week, 25-movie retrospective of his work continues this weekend with two movies about hit men: ''The Killers'' (1964), an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's story, which features a villainous Ronald Reagan in his last film role, and ''The Lineup'' (1958), with Eli Wallach and Robert Keith skulking through San Francisco. Next week's films include ''Escape From Alcatraz'' (1979), with Clint Eastwood re-enacting the prison's only successful jailbreak; ''The Shootist'' (1976), about a dying gunfighter (John Wayne in his final performance); and ''The Duel at Silver Creek'' (1952), a western starring Audie Murphy and Stephen McNally. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)    RECENT FILMS FROM DENMARK (Through April 19) Scandinavia House continues its overall Scandinavian film series with Erik Clausen's ''Villa Paranoia'' (2004), a satire about an unemployed actress, the elderly man she nurses and the son who seems a little too eager to inherit. 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    BURT BACHARACH (Monday and Tuesday) Elvis Costello's 1998 collaboration helped reveal the strange melodic contours and bitter melancholy in songs by Burt Bacharach with Hal David's lyrics, spurring a rediscovery of the composer behind ''Walk on By,'' ''The Look of Love'' and ''Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.'' On his own, Mr. Bacharach conceals his peculiarities behind a thick gauze of easy-listening arrangements. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $75 to $150. (Jon Pareles)    PIERRE BENSUSAN (Tuesday) Pierre Bensusan, an Algerian guitarist who lives in France, is a virtuoso who sings and fingerpicks his way through his own hybrids of Celtic music with Middle Eastern music, jazz and whatever else strikes his ear. 9:30 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500; $18. (Pareles)    BLACKALICIOUS (Tomorrow) Blackalicious are Bay Area rappers and associates of DJ Shadow who offer a socially conscious message with dense yet elastic flow over funky beats. The like-minded rappers Lifesavas and Fat Lip, of Pharcyde fame, open. 10:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $19.50 in advance, $22 at the door. (Laura Sinagra)    TONI BRAXTON (Sunday) Toni Braxton was a great R&B diva for the 90's, with her mix of preacher's-daughter naïveté and a kind of wounded sensuality that found its apex in the hit ''Un-break My Heart.'' 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; (212) 307-7171; $65 and $85. (Sinagra)    BURNING SPEAR (Wednesday) Winston Rodney, who calls himself Burning Spear, has been a voice of conscience for Jamaican reggae since the 1970's, singing about oppression and Rastafarian faith. Yet while his messages are serious, he's also one of reggae's most ebullient singers, and as he gets older, he hasn't slowed down. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Pareles)    NEKO CASE, MARTHA WAINWRIGHT (Thursday) The clarion voice that's best known to many as the transcendent secret weapon of the Canadian pop group New Pornographers belongs to the alt-country chanteuse Ms. Case, who performs her own songs here. The folk singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright, like her parents -- Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III -- can be roundly sad or quippishly tart. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)    CORDERO (Tonight) Mixing the open atmospherics of the Southwest with the gritty feel of the Brooklyn art scene, the bilingual Ani Cordero (who has worked with Calexico and Giant Sand) and her band make guitar rock that gives urban brashness some borderland mystery. 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $8. (Sinagra)    ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. Backed by a rock band merged with a trio of strings, his songs move from chamber-music delicacy to two-chord stomps, and they can be stubbornly cathartic. Tonight at 7 and 9:30., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; sold out. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $15. (Pareles)    MELISSA FERRICK, ERIN MCKEOWN (Sunday) The singer-songwriter Melissa Ferrick is a folk force of nature, voicing her powerful plaints with shudder and shake. Erin McKeown has evolved since her days of spare, collegiate confessionals in the Ani DiFranco vein. Her newer material is more lushly produced, and her musing more universal. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-211; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE FLAMING LIPS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The indomitable optimist and indie-rock showman Wayne Coyne and his band of Oklahoma boys continue to make good-trip psychedelia. They play here with the Pink Mountaintops. 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; both shows sold out. (Sinagra)    FOLK MUSIC OF AFGHANISTAN (Tonight) The Afghan singer Vaheed Kaacemy, the scion of a renowned musical family; the lutist Quraishi; and the dohl-player Chetram Sahni perform folk songs from the many traditions of their vast country. 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 545-7536; $30 and $40; children, $26 and $35; students, $15. (Sinagra)    JUAN GABRIEL (Tonight) One of Mexico's most flamboyant and crowd-pleasing singers, Mr. Gabriel writes extravagantly romantic ballads, along with songs expressing trenchant thoughts on immigration and globalization. He works with slick pop bands, mariachi groups and brass bands, sometimes all in the same marathon concert. 8, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $69.50 to $139.50. (Pareles)    DAVID GILMOUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) This erstwhile Pink Floyd lead guitarist has a rock-god following of his own, and as he tours here behind his solo album, ''On an Island'' (Columbia), written with his wife, expect some deep dives into the Floyd catalog. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $64.50 to $154.60. (Sinagra)    Gorillaz: ''DEMON DAYS LIVE'' (Sunday though Thursday) Damon Albarn, the wizard behind the animated rock band Gorillaz, has organized a star-laden cast to help him perform the group's latest album, the eerie but elevating rock-hop ''Demon Days'' in its entirety. That cast includes De La Soul, Ike Turner, Shaun Ryder, Roots Manuva, Martina Topley-Bird, Neneh Cherry and the Pharcyde's Bootie Brown. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; all shows sold out. (Sinagra)    HARD-FI (Tomorrow) Using dub tactics like ominous echoes and faraway sirens to add dimension to its paranoid but melodic punk sound, this British band creates a more cavernous and even cinematic space than most. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $16. (Sinagra)    KID ROCK (Tonight) A couple of Sheryl Crow duets and a recent cameo in an unauthorized sex tape haven't done a whole heck of a lot to renew interest in the Kid or his Southern-fried, Rust Belt rap-boogie. But he still likes to have trashy fun in his tank top, and the tour bus rolls on. 7, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $50. (Sinagra)    GLENN KOTCHE, TEDDY THOMPSON (Tonight) The Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche's new solo CD, ''Mobile'' (Nonesuch), finds him exploring questing realms of melodic percussion while still keeping a firm grip on the musical math. The British folk-rocker Teddy Thompson looks to distinguish himself from his parents, Richard and Linda, while still honoring their legacy. His baritone voice sounds like his father's without the bite, not always a bad thing. 7, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $17.50 (Sinagra)    SONDRE LERCHE  (Thursday) Since making an indie cabaret-rock splash in 2002, this Norwegian guitarist and crooner's music has suggested life experience beyond his tender years. Lately he has taken a break from the baroque, applying his breathy yet urgent voice to a batch of lighthearted, stripped-down jazzy tunes. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sinagra)    MASTERS OF INDIAN MUSIC (Tomorrow) The South Indian singer Sanjay Subramaniam began honing his intense voice as a young child, graduating early to the concert hall circuit. He will be accompanied by the violinist Nagai Muralidharan, the barrel drum percussionist Guruvayur Dorai and the tambourine player Neyveli Venkatesh. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26; $22 for children; $15 for students. (Sinagra)    THE ORB (Tomorrow) In the 90's, the Orb's ambient house music made it one of the most popular mind-warp rave soundtracks. 7:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $26. (Sinagra)    THE PRETENDERS (Tomorrow) Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders is certainly a foremother of tough-but-tender rock chicks like Eleanor Friedburger and Karen O. Her Akron via England attitude comes across forcefully on hits like ''Brass in Pocket'' and ''Middle of the Road.'' 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra)    RYE COALITION (Tonight and tomorrow) Rye Coalition began as an angular rock band in the style of Fugazi but now mixes in more elements of 70's hard rock. This weekend the group screens a DVD about its struggles before each performance. Tonight at 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10.

(Sinagra)    SASHA and JOHN DIGWEED (Tonight) Sasha and Digweed have been the dominant D.J.'s in trance techno throughout its global rollout. They reunite tonight as a duo. 10, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000; $40 to $60. (Sinagra)    SERENA MANEESH (Tomorrow) This Norwegian band takes a lighthearted approach to distorted, textured rock blare. Its alternately screeching and orchestral atmospherics are mismatched with its vocal purr and squawk. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra)    SAVES THE DAY (Tonight) More in the Death Cab for Cutie vein of contemplative emo rock than in the glut of full-on ''screamo'' bands that followed it onto the scene, Saves the Day returns to claim its place. 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra)    SHE WANTS REVENGE, NIGHTMARE OF YOU (Tuesday) She Wants Revenge plays post-punk in the dark Interpol style. Chances are good the group will be upstaged by the opener, Nightmare of You, a lean and muscular group whose live show is more convincing than its recordings. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra)    SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Tomorrow and Sunday) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $45. Family concert on Sunday at 1 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $8. (Pareles)    THE STILLS (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Stills continue to sound like Strokes-era guitar rock, but they've gotten away from their initial dark new wave and moved in the direction of gutsy bar-band revelation. 9:45 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; sold out. (Sinagra)    GLENN TILBROOK (Tonight) Glenn Tilbrook, of the 80's melodic poppers Squeeze, continues his erstwhile band's quirky, hooky music, this time taking a crack at lyric-writing. 10, Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    WHAT I LIKE ABOUT JEW (Thursday) The cabaret-rock comedians Sean Altman and Rob Tannenbaum might be giants of Jewish joke-pop, but you can also hear some Beatles in their risqué borscht-belting. They play here with a full band, made up of members of Loser's Lounge. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 941-8100; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)    * Barbara Cook (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Broadway legend is loose, down-home and, as always, magnificent, singing a 25-year retrospective of songs she has performed at the Café Carlyle. 8:45 and 10:45, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $85; dinner required at the 8:45 shows. (Holden)    ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)    * KT Sullivan and Mark Nadler (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the words of Cole Porter, whose songs are performed here by a ripened Botticelli Venus and a reincarnation of Danny Kaye, ooh-la-la-la, c'est magnifique. 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover, with a $50 prix fixe dinner (required at the early shows), or a $20 minimum. (Holden)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    CANNONBALL ADDERLEY LEGACY BAND (Tuesday through April 9) Cannonball Adderley was an alto saxophonist who balanced bebop's harmonic precision with homegrown grit and soul. This tribute, led by his former drummer Louis Hayes, features Vincent Herring on alto saxophone, as well as the singer Paula West and the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 p.m. set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (For NYC & Company discount, (212) 484-1222.) (Nate Chinen)    ANDY BEY (Tomorrow) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll surely demonstrate with his quartet here, on a concert stage in his old hometown. 7:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $37. (Chinen)    STEFANO BOLLANI TRIO/FRANCESCO CAFISO QUARTET (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Bollani, a pianist with extensive pop credentials, recently gave a fine performance on an album with the trumpeter Enrico Rava and the drummer Paul Motian; Mr. Cafiso, a teenage alto saxophone prodigy, just released a self-assured album called ''Happy Time'' (Cam). Both artists perform here, each with his own working band. 8 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    JOE CHAMBERS BAND (Thursday and next Friday) Mr. Chambers, a veteran drummer with a gliding sense of swing, leads a hard-bop group featuring two good saxophonists -- Vincent Herring on alto and Javon Jackson on tenor -- as well as the versatile pianist Joanne Brackeen. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    CARLA COOK (Tonight and tomorrow) A confident and vivacious jazz singer with a growing book of original tunes. 8 and 10 p.m. and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    DUDUKA DA FONSECA SEXTET (Through Sunday) On his new album, ''Samba Jazz in Black & White'' (Zoho), the percussionist Duduka Da Fonseca devises an ebullient small-group concept inspired by the sounds of his native Brazil. His ensemble includes the singer Maucha Adnet, the guitarist Vic Juris, and Paulo Levi or Anat Cohen on reeds. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50 to $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    JORRIT DIJKSTRA AND JOHN HOLLENBECK (Wednesday) Mr. Dijkstra, an alto saxophonist from Amsterdam, and Mr. Hollenbeck, a percussionist from upstate New York, have been working as a duet for years, with an emphasis on extraordinary textures and extended techniques. This electro-acoustic performance precedes the release of a new album, ''Sequence'' (Trytone). 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    ROY HARGROVE BIG BAND (Tuesday) Mr. Hargrove, the trumpeter, has been a paragon of small-group hard bop since the early 1990's. But he has also led a big band, on and off, for roughly the same span of time; he recently rekindled the format here, with powerful results. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $30. (Chinen)    HIGHLIGHTS IN JAZZ (Thursday) The longest-running jazz series in the city advances what it calls the Ultimate Jam Session, with David (Fathead) Newman and Ernie Andrews on saxophones, Steve Turre on trombone, Lew Soloff on trumpet, Mulgrew Miller on piano and Jimmy Cobb on drums. 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 220-1460; $30.00. (Chinen)    THE JAZZ PASSENGERS (Monday) Since being formed almost 20 years ago by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson and the trombonist Curtis Fowlkes, this ensemble has fashioned a colorful mélange of retro pop, post-bop and ironic show-biz shtick. In addition to Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Fowlkes, the group includes Bill Ware on vibraphone, Sam Bardfeld on violin, Brad Jones on bass and E. J. Rodriguez on drums. 9:30 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    TONY MALABY TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Malaby, a versatile and increasingly prominent tenor saxophonist, convenes a promising exploratory trio with Marcus Rojas on tuba and John Hollenbeck on drums and percussion. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village,(212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    DONNY McCASLIN GROUP (Tuesday) As he does on ''Soar'' (Sunnyside), a noteworthy new album, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin applies his extroverted style to a Latin American-inspired contemporary fusion, benefiting greatly from the contributions of the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Scott Colley and the percussionists Antonio Sanchez and Pernell Saturnino. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    MEDESKI MARTIN & WOOD (Thursday) The pianist John Medeski, the drummer Billy Martin and the bassist Chris Wood make up this trio, which usually traffics in the kind of groove music once practiced by the Meters and Eddie Harris. This concert finds the group playing in an all-acoustic vein, the setting that most exposes their avant-garde proclivities. 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $35 to $40. (Chinen)    JASON MORAN AND THE BANDWAGON (Tonight) Mr. Moran is a bright pianist who favors a jagged and delirious sort of polyphony; his group, the Bandwagon, features the earthy yet slippery rhythm team of Tarus Mateen, bassist, and Nasheet Waits, drummer. 8, Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, One University Place, Long Island University, Flatbush Avenue Extension and DeKalb Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, ext. 2229, or www.651arts.org; $25. (Chinen)    PAUL MOTIAN QUARTET (Tuesday through April 9) The teasingly suggestive drumming of Mr. Motian is just one of several enigmas posed by this ensemble, which is also distinguished by the tightly coiled alto saxophone scribbles of Greg Osby and the abstruse pianism of Masabumi Kikuchi. Larry Grenadier, on bass, serves a welcome clarifying purpose. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    * DAVID MURRAY QUARTET/ODEAN POPE SAXOPHONE CHOIR (Tuesday through April 9) In terms of sheer saxophone bluster, it would be tough to conjure a weightier double bill than this one, which pairs the avant-garde tenor titan David Murray (with Lafayette Gilchrist on piano, Jaribu Shahid on bass and Hamid Drake on drums) and the Odean Pope Saxophone Choir (nine saxophones, including Mr. Pope, and a rhythm section). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    KRESTEN OSGOOD TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Osgood, an energetic young Danish drummer, nominally leads this group with the guitarist Michael Gregory Jackson and the alto saxophonist Oliver Lake, but the power of Mr. Lake's instrumental voice may tip the scales in another direction. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO (Wednesday) Mr. Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce, no matter how dark or furious the extemporization; he's at his best in the company of assertive partners like the electric bassist Richard Bona and the drummer Clarence Penn, who join him here. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)    BOB REYNOLDS QUINTET (Wednesday) Mr. Reynolds is a self-assured tenor saxophonist and an unassuming yet effective composer, as he proves on ''Can't Wait for Perfect'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), a sturdy new debut. He's joined here by some of the musicians on the album, including the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the guitarist Mike Moreno and the bassist Reuben Rogers. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    SCOTT ROBINSON (Tonight) Outer space and early swing are equal preoccupations for the multireedist Mr. Robinson, who is best known as a stalwart sideman. Here he applies his unique view of jazz repertory toward an expansive small-group performance. 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $15. (Chinen)    ELLIOT SHARP'S LIMBIC TRIO (Tomorrow) Mr. Sharp, a saxophonist and polyglot experimentalist, introduces an ensemble with Kevin Ray on bass and Donald McKenzie on drums. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    JAMES (BLOOD) ULMER (Tonight and tomorrow night) The guitarist and singer James (Blood) Ulmer fashions an oddly hypnotic combination of influences: Ornette Coleman's polytonality crossed with the psychedelic swagger of Jimi Hendrix. Here, as on a 2001 album called ''Memphis Blood: The Sun Sessions'' (Hyena), he focuses on the blues, in a seven-piece ensemble organized by a kindred spirit, the experimental rock guitarist Vernon Reid. 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30. (Chinen)    WHAT IS JAZZ? (Wednesday) This unanswerable question comes courtesy of Ropeadope Records, as do the stirrings of the funk-infused Christian McBride Band; the soul-inspired Charlie Hunter Trio; the cut-and-paste groove of DJ Logic; and the dynamic solo percussion of Bobby Previte. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; cover, $20. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Thursday) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. At the first performance, Kelly Kaduce made an appealing Mimi, pairing her character's physical weakness with focused vocal strength. Gerard Powers sang Rodolfo with a solid top but a thinner middle range. For Thursday's performance, a new cast comes in with Yunah Lee (Mimi), Jennifer Black (Musetta) and Phillip Torre (Marcello). Steven White conducts tomorrow, David Wroe on Thursday. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 remaining tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Thursday. (Jeremy Eichler)    'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Amato's venerable recipe -- no rehearsals, changing casts at every performance -- should make for an unusual version of Mozart's classic dish, but at least the theater's small scale represents a kind of period fidelity. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)    'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Neither objectionable nor particularly fresh or insightful, Harold Prince's 1989 staging of this great Mozart opera is a good, basic presentation of the work. The company's opening cast includes Christopher Schaldenbrand in the title role; Robert Gierlach as Leporello; Hanan Alattar as Zerlina; Orla Boylan as Donna Anna and Elizabeth Caballero as Donna Elvira. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 remaining tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Tuesday. (Allan Kozinn)    * 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Monday) Why mount a new production of a frothy opera buffa? At the Met this weekend, the answer is: hot young stars. Anna Netrebko is the soprano of the moment; Juan Diego Flórez, the best lyric tenor around; Mariusz Kwiecien, a fine baritone. They look good and they should sound great. Tonight at 8, Monday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 to $250 remaining tonight; sold out on Monday. (Midgette)    * 'FIDELIO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Jürgen Flimm's strikingly contemporary and deeply humane production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' which opened at the Met in 2000, is back. So is the soprano Karita Mattila, who gives a courageous and vocally radiant portrayal of Leonore, opera's most valiant and devoted wife. The conductor Paul Nadler has taken over for James Levine, who has withdrawn for the rest of the season, and though Mr. Nadler is no Levine, he does honorable work. All in all, this production still delivers. And Ms. Mattila is astonishing. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LUISA MILLER'  (Tomorrow) Because of illness, there have been more substitutions in this run of ''Luisa'' than in the ninth inning of a spring training baseball game. But Veronica Villarroel and Neil Shicoff, the original leads, are both scheduled to sing this final performance, along with the solid if uninflected baritone Carlos Alvarez and, in lieu of James Morris, the fine bass Vitalij Kowaljow. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220. (Midgette)    'LYSISTRATA' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) Mark Adamo's fantastical operatic adaptation of Aristophanes' antiwar comedy had its premiere last year at the Houston Grand Opera. That production is now at the New York City Opera. Mr. Adamo's score is bustling and hyper-rhythmic, but sometimes too dense. Still, he takes seriously the story of Athenian and Spartan women who join forces to refuse their husbands and lovers sex until the men stop waging a seemingly endless war. At its best, the opera becomes a somber meditation on the intertwining of passion and aggression. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 731-6500; $16 to $120 tomorrow and Wednesday; $45 remaining on Sunday. (Tommasini)    'MANON' (Wednesday) The news is Renée Fleming, who returns to a signature role in the venerable but appealing production by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, along with the tenor Massimo Giordano, under the baton of Jesús López-Cobos. Not news is the length of this grand opera; after hearing an opera by Massenet, a notable dramatic soprano is supposed to have said, ''And they say Wagner is long?'' 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out. (Midgette)    'LA TRAVIATA' (Thursday) The Met's re-energized production of this Verdi opera continues its long run with Hei-Kyung Hong as Violetta, Frank Lopardo as Alfredo and Dwayne Croft as Germont. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6200; sold out. (Bernard Holland)    Classical Music    SÉRGIO AND ODAIR ASSAD (Sunday) This Brazilian guitar duo touches on a wide variety of music, which ranges from Albéniz and Rodrigo to the contemporary Cuban composer Leo Brouwer to jazz-tinged works by Egberto Gismonti. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Kozinn)    JONATHAN BISS (Sunday) The Peoples' Symphony Concerts presents recitals by big-name artists and up-and-coming players for as little as the cost of a movie. This weekend, it's the young American pianist Jonathan Biss performing Janacek, Schumann and Beethoven, as well as a recent work by Lewis Spratlan called ''Wonderer.'' 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 and $11. (Eichler)    BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Michael Christie, the orchestra's new music director, has assembled a compelling slate of programs for his first season. The second of them looks at this year's two anniversary celebrants, Mozart and Shostakovich, both directly -- by way of Shostakovich's Symphony for Strings and Mozart's ''King Thamos'' -- as well as through the eyes of Alfred Schnittke, whose amusing ''Moz-Art à la Haydn'' opens the concert. 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Kozinn)    CHAMBER MUSIC AT THE Y (Tuesday and Wednesday) The baritone Nathaniel Webster performs Ned Rorem's ''Aftermath,'' written in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Ravel's Violin Sonata and Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet fill out the program courtesy of Jaime Laredo, Cynthia Phelps, Sharon Robinson and Joseph Kalichstein. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Eichler)    ALICE COOTE (Sunday) This British mezzo-soprano, best known for her performances and recordings of early music, makes her Met debut later this month as Cherubino in ''Le Nozze di Figaro.'' But those who want an early glimpse of Ms. Coote's artistry can hear her in a recital of songs by Mahler and Schubert. 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Tommasini)    JEROME L. GREENE CONCERT (Tonight) Daniel Beckwith conducts an ensemble of Juilliard students in an all-Handel program. 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Eichler)    QUINN KELSEY (Sunday) This young Hawaiian-born baritone, who has been coming up through the young artist program at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, sings a recital as part of the ''On Wings of Song'' series, sponsored by the Marilyn Horne Foundation. His intriguingly titled program, ''Songs of Separation,'' offers works by Beethoven, Barber, Fauré and Mussorgsky. 3 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 51st Street, (212) 378-0248; $20; $15 for 65+; free for students. (Tommasini)    * YUNDI LI (Monday) Murray Perahia was to have given a recital at Carnegie Hall on this night, but when he withdrew, Carnegie turned to this fantastic young Chinese pianist, who will play Mozart's Sonata in C, Schumann's ''Carnaval'' and the Liszt Sonata in B minor, a work he plays brilliantly on his first Deutsche Grammophon CD. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Kozinn)    * yO-YO MA (Wednesday) Mr. Ma plays three of Bach's six solo works for the cello. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Holland)    NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Thursday) It's nice when a major performer plays a new work; it's even nicer when he likes it enough to keep on playing it. The pianist Emanuel Ax has certainly taken to the concerto Melinda Wagner wrote for him, called ''Extremity of Sky,'' enough that he's played it a number of times since its first performance with the Chicago Symphony in 2003, and is now giving its first New York performance. Leonard Slatkin and the National Symphony will also offer ''Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance,'' a ballet Samuel Barber wrote for Martha Graham, and Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Midgette)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight) This one-time Philharmonic program conducted by Lorin Maazel offers works by Brahms, Kodaly and Dvorak. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92. (Holland)    VADIM REPIN AND NIKOLAI LUGANSKY (Sunday) Two Eastern European virtuosos, the violinist Vadim Repin and the pianist Nikolai Lugansky, play Bartok, Schubert, Pärt and Franck. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $56. (Holland)    * ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tuesday) This excellent choir, led by John Scott, performs Bach's ''St. John Passion.'' The soloists are Mark Bleeke, Craig Phillips and Christopher Trueblood. With the Concert Royal. 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360; $25 to $60. (Eichler)    SKAMPA STRING QUARTET (Tonight) Having just played as part of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, this busy ensemble of young musicians from Prague comes to Weill Recital Hall. In an interesting stroke, excerpts from John Adams's impish homage to dance rhythms in classical music, ''John's Book of Alleged Dances,'' will come between quartets by Mozart and Beethoven. 7:30, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42. (Tommasini)    MASAAKI SUZUKI (Tomorrow) A prophet of period-instrument Bach in Japan, Mr. Suzuki led his Bach Collegium Japan in a concert earlier in the week, but tomorrow he has the stage to himself for what promises to be a revelatory harpsichord performance of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Book II. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38. (Kozinn)    TALLIS SCHOLARS (Tomorrow) The rock stars of Renaissance vocal music (well, figuratively), the members of this a cappella ensemble return to New York in a program of 16th-century polyphony, exploring ''Mozart's Roots,'' that includes Praetorius, Schütz and, of course, Bach. 8 p.m., Riverside Church Nave, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35. (Midgette)    * WU MAN (Thursday) The pipa, a Chinese lute, has been finding a place in Western classical music in recent years, not only through the works of Chinese composers, but also at Bang on a Can marathons and in concerts by the Kronos Quartet. Often, in New York shows, the instrument is played by Wu Man, a virtuoso offering a concert as part of Kronos's series at Carnegie Hall. With an ensemble including a banjo, dulcimer, Ukrainian zither, African harp and percussion, Ms. Wu offers a program that includes Chinese traditional music, bluegrass tunes and new works by Eric Moe, Chen Yi and Julian Kytasty. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Kozinn)    YOUNG CONCERT ARTiSTS (Wednesday) Every year, as part of its benefit gala, this organization presents its talented young prizewinners in various concertos with a full orchestra. This year, a Chinese double-bassist named DaXun Zhang will perform, improbably enough, ''Carmen Fantasy,'' originally a violin showpiece. Lise de la Salle, a French pianist, will perform Liszt's Concerto No. 1, and Jose Franch-Ballester, a Spanish clarinetist, will play Copland's Clarinet Concerto. Keith Lockhart leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's. 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 307-6656; $25 to $35.

(Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)    * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)    * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)    * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)    Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. One of the most interesting concerns the genteel technique of cut-paper silhouette that is the basis of Ms. Walker's scathing take-no-prisoners exploration of slavery and its tragic legacy. (See above.) (Smith)    THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)    THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work, from his dense, Cubist-style oil, ''When God Considered the Creation of the Plants'' (1913), to a beautifully stylized rendering of the jazz singer and dancer Josephine Baker (1927) to labyrinthine compositions like ''Or the Mocked Mocker'' (1930). 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1: Jessica Stockholder: 'Of Standing Float Roots in Thin Air,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. Beauty is hard to come by. Check out, among other things, Paul Chan's digital animation of shadowy objects like cellphones and bicycles, floating upward, Wizard of Oz-like, while bodies tumble down, the work cast as if it were light from a tall window slanting onto the floor of a dark room. And also Pierre Huyghe's film, shot in Antarctica and Central Park. It's really gorgeous: crosscut between day and night, fiction and reality, it encapsulates the show's operative but ultimately airy metaphor about the slippery state of art now. (''Day for Night'' is the biennial's first-ever title, after the François Truffaut film.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    * MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark, and adds another twist to the convoluted history of appropriation art. GBE@Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258, through April 22. (Smith)    Other Galleries    'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson)    Last Chance    * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984'  It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; closes tomorrow. (Glueck)    * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750; closes Monday. (Johnson)    * DAVID HAMMONS: 'SELECTED WORKS' A rare exhibition of 11 objects and drawings highlights the robust tactility and sculptural intelligence in this elusive, influential artist's work. His use of eccentric discarded materials and found objects goes beyond Duchampian gesture to comment pointedly, but with elegance and wit, on poverty, deprivation and the ingenuity they can engender. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA' This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200; closes Sunday.(Edward Rothstein)    * KEIZO KITAJIMA: 'NEW YORK' The New York debut of this Japanese photographer consists of more than three dozen pictures taken during a six-month sojourn in New York in 1981. His subjects include immigrants, drag queens and club kids, celebrities and nascent celebrities, all portrayed with a magnetic combination of glamour, grit and gravitas. Cohen Amador Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-6740; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines' Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closes Sunday. (Kimmelman)    Rachel Whiteread: 'Bibliography' Cardboard boxes cast in plaster are displayed in monotonous profusion singly and in groups by this British sculptor who once made a concrete cast of the inside of a whole house. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100; closes tomorrow.
