O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anne Midgette)    'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers that she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.(Isherwood)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'EINSTEIN'S GIFT'  Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Neil Genzlinger)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'INDIA AWAITING' The charismatic Maulik Pancholy is an Indian-born Wall Street trader torn between his love for an American woman and his lingering ties to home (2:00). Samuel Beckett Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Miriam Horn)    'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    * 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer-Prize winning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley).    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easy--+going to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'ASHLEY MONTANA GOES ASHORE IN THE CAICOS, OR: WHAT AM I DOING HERE?' A revue of satiric songs and sketches by Roger Rosenblatt that seeks to comment on the state of the national psyche. It's not good, apparently, but what's new? A bright cast keeps things lively, but Mr. Rosenblatt's targets are mostly moldy (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101 (Isherwood)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30).

(Brantley)    Last Chance    '4.48 PSYCHOSE' The French screen siren Isabelle Huppert gives an extraordinarily economical, admirably concentrated performance in Sarah Kane's dark, thrumming ode to negation. But Claude RÃ©gy's clinical production doesn't manage to chase away the ghost in the machine: the text's resistance to taking effective theatrical shape (1:45). Part of the Next Wave Festival. Performed in French with abridged English titles. Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'SAINT OEDIPUS' Combines actors and puppets with Greek and Christian myth to create a fierce, virtuosic theater piece (1:10). The Wierszalin Theater of Poland at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, closing Sunday. (Jefferson)    * 'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    'LA TEMPESTAD' - It's an interesting experiment and a pretty interesting play, even without the experiment: the idea is to transplant the characters and some of the themes from ''The Tempest'' to a setting and story far removed from Shakespeare's tale and see what happens. Larry Loebell, the author, chooses the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, and Prospero's main demon is the American military, which uses it for aerial target practice (2:15). Resonance Ensemble, at the Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101, closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AFTER INNOCENCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) Calm, deliberate and devastating, Jessica Sanders's documentary ''After Innocence'' examines the cases of seven men wrongly convicted of murder and rape and exonerated years later by DNA evidence. It confirms many of your worst fears about the weaknesses of the American criminal justice system.(Stephen Holden)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)    * 'DOMINO' (R, 113 minutes) A lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills from Tony Scott about the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey. (Manohla Dargis)    'DOOM' (R, 95 minutes) In this formulaic, claustrophobic shoot-'em-up, based on a video game, soldiers quell a mutant uprising on Mars. Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as the Rock, is the trigger-happy troop leader, while Rosamund Pike is the forensic archaeologist, who, like the audience, is trapped in a loud, hellish enclosure. (Ned Martel)    'DREAMER: INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY' (PG, 105 minutes) Pure, schmaltzy formula -- an injured racehorse, a down-on-his-luck trainer, his angelically cute daughter -- but just try to resist it.( Scott)    'ELIZABETHTOWN' (PG-13, 121 minutes) A well-intentioned mess from Cameron Crowe, in which a young man (the weightless Orlando Bloom) loses his job and his father and finds true love (the hard-working Kirsten Dunst) -- all in the course of a very short week and a very long two hours. (Scott)    'EMMANUEL'S GIFT' (G, 80 minutes) The inspirational story of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a disabled young man from Ghana, West Africa, whose mission is to improve the lives of others like himself. But beneath the weight of Oprah Winfrey's pushy narration and a succession of overly posed images, ''Emmanuel's Gift'' becomes a powerful story of political change that is almost smothered by contrivance. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'THE FOG' (PG-13, 100 minutes) This occasionally scary remake is about a dense, mysterious fog that hides vengeful spirits with a century-old grudge against an Oregon seaside town. At least there's a good-looking young cast, led by Tom Welling of ''Smallville'' and Maggie Grace of ''Lost.'' (Anita Gates)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    * 'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)    * 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy, best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests. (Dargis)    'INNOCENT VOICES' (R, 120 minutes, in Spanish) Alternately powerful and mawkish, ''Innocent Voices'' remembers the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980's through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy from a rural village who faces forcible conscription into the army. (Holden)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of L.A. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)    'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Gates)    'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)    * 'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)    'NORTH COUNTRY' (R, 123 minutes) A wobbly fiction about a real pioneering sex-discrimination case, ''North Country'' is an unabashed vehicle for its modestly de-glammed star, Charlize Theron, but it's also a star vehicle with heart -- an old-fashioned liberal weepie about truth and justice. (Dargis)    * 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)    'THE PROTOCOLS OF ZION' (No rating, 93 minutes) Marc Levin's ''Protocols of Zion,'' a documentary about a century-old forgery purporting to reveal a Jewish master plan to rule the world, makes its case expertly and powerfully. The film even has laughs (which is no small feat), but the cumulative effect of its message is enormous sadness that hate is so strong and so resistant to reason.(Gates)    'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)    'ROOMS FOR TOURISTS' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Five young women, who've never met, find themselves stranded in the desolate outskirts of Buenos Aires for a night after missing their connecting train. They accept a local man's offer of room and board, and promptly find themselves hunted by masked psychos through the narrow hallways of his old, dark house. A creepy, no-budget film shot on black-and-white video and full of sinister atmosphere.(Laura Kern)    'THE ROOST' (No rating, 80 minutes) A minimalist horror movie with more ambition than resources, ''The Roost'' treads a well-worn path as four friends (Karl Jacob, Sean Reid, and real-life siblings Will and Vanessa Horneff) are stranded at an isolated farmhouse filled with vampire bats and angry zombies. Though the premise is rough, and the acting rougher, the movie proceeds with such youthful enthusiasm that its rawness is more charming than annoying. (Catsoulis)    'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)    'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'STAY' (R, 98 minutes) The director Marc Forster, whose previous films include ''Finding Neverland,'' takes a maximalist approach to this mysterioso story about a psychiatrist and a suicidal patient dislocated by time, space and lots of crazily raked angles. (Dargis)    'THREE  EXTREMES' (R, 125 minutes, in Japanese, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese) This trilogy provides a sampler of short horror films from high-profile Asian directors: China's Fruit Chan, South Korea's Park Chan-Wook, and Japan's Takashi Miike. ''Three  Extremes'' may seem tame to jaded fans of what's been termed ''New Asian Horror,'' but it serves as a fine introduction to the genre for those who are curious but squeamish. (Dana Stevens)    'THREE OF HEARTS: A POSTMODERN FAMILY' (No rating, 98 minutes) Susan Kaplan and David Friedson's documentary about a mÃ©nage Ã  trois in contemporary New York could have been inane and smirky. But thanks to a development 13 years into Sam, Samantha and Steven's relationship, it becomes thought-provoking. (Gates)    'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)    'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden)    'EL VACILÃN: THE MOVIE' (R, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Luis Jimenez and Moonshadow, hosts of the wildly popular morning show on La Mega radio (WSKQ-FM), play themselves making a movie about their lives and their listeners' sexual adventures. The result is 90 minutes of over-the-top gross-out humor. (Gates)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)    'WHERE the TRUTH LIES' (No rating, 107 minutes) Atom Egoyan's drama about a fictional comedy team from the 1950's features an overly knotty murder mystery, a mess of blondes and two fine performances from Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth. (Dargis)    FILM SERIES    CHILDREN IN THE 20TH CENTURY (Through Nov. 22) Symphony Space Thalia Film's international program of films focusing on problems that affect children continues with two films.

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    JOAN BAEZ, RICHARD THOMPSON (Tonight) The clips of Joan Baez in her folkie heyday, projecting a voice both haunting and hopeful, and her wistful but wised-up present-day interviews lent warmth to Martin Scorsese's recent Bob Dylan documentary. Richard Thompson's gruff voice and angular rock guitar are still sardonically forceful, and his rueful folk forays remain moving, making him the perfect choice to compose the soundtrack to Werner Herzog's character study ''Grizzly Man.'' 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $17 to $60. (Laura Sinagra)    BLACK DICE, THE DOUBLE (Tonight) The experimental band Black Dice expands its palette of sharp noise to include ominous glitch electronics, warped meta-blues and churning tribal bursts. The Double uses all the tools at its lo-fi disposal in service of arty pop undercut with burbles, dark surges and twinges. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212) 777-6800; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    JAMES BLUNT (Wednesday and Thursday) With a Rod Stewart vocal tone that can also flip into transporting falsetto, this British artist writes songs in the ethereal but angsty Elliot Smith vein, only with more forceful alt-pop production. His song ''No Bravery'' is an antiwar lament that clings. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 (both shows sold out). (Sinagra)    THE COUP, LIFESAVAS (Tomorrow) The funky, political Coup took flak in 2001 for a pre-9/11 album cover featuring exploding twin towers. But the group's main man, Boots Riley, has lost none of the oppositional fervor. The Portland, Ore., hip-hop duo Lifesavas shares the righteous bent of others on the Bay Area label Quannum Records. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    SHERYL CROW (Sunday and Monday) Though her latest material goes heavy on the strings in an attempt to play up her romantic side, she still traffics in comforting clichÃ©s that are more gutsy classic rock than croon-pop. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $50 to $100. (Sinagra)    DIOS (MALOS) (Wednesday) This laid-back quintet from Hawthorne, Calif., plays shaggy indie-rock marked by questing vocals, dream-pop harmonies and a kind of acoustic-electronic psychedelia that conjures a couch daydream rather than a desert drive. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $9 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sinagra)    DRESDEN DOLLS (Tonight) Combining bash and chatter with Weimar-style cabaret, this Boston duo, the singer and pianist Amanda Palmer and the drummer Brian Viglione, plays feisty call-and-response punk. The Gypsy punkers Devotchka and the band Faun Fables are also on the bill. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    AL GREEN (Thursday) Soul oldies meet gospel testifying in Al Green's highly unpredictable performances. He sings, he preaches, he dances, he tosses roses to the ladies. He jumps in and out of songs and teases the crowd with his timing and his whims. Sometimes he makes songs like ''Let's Stay Together'' sound like aching, immediate pleas; sometimes the audience ends up singing more than he does. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street; (212) 997-4144, $175, SRO tickets $100.(Jon Pareles)    NANCI GRIFFITH AND THE BLUE MOON ORCHESTRA/THE CRICKETS/ELIZABETh COOK (Wednesday) Nanci Griffith comes from the school of Texas songwriting that finds little epiphanies amid small-town lives and loves. She has a tendency to sugarcoat her character studies with her little-girl voice, but she'll get some Texas rockabilly grit from the band sharing the bill: the Crickets, Buddy Holly's band. The concert also features Elizabeth Cook, a country singer with a full-fledged streak of honky-tonk. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, $35 to $65. (Pareles)    HANSON (Wednesday) As they've grown up, the squeaky-clean brothers responsible for the exuberant late-90's hit ''Mmm-bop'' have attempted blues-pop and songwriting without much pop success. The middle brother, Taylor, with his pop-star looks and breathy, urgently breaking tenor, remains the draw. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171, $35. (Sinagra)    SHARON JONES AND THE DAP KINGS (Monday) Determined to bring back 1960's soul, the Daptone label put together a house band, the Dap-Kings, and found itself a church-rooted singer from Augusta, Ga., Sharon Jones, who finds the flirtation and heartache in songs by the Dap Kings' bassist, Bosco Mann. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $14 in advance, $16 at the door. (Pareles)    ROBERT EARL KEEN (Thursday) This gravel-voiced Texas songwriter, a contemporary of Lyle Lovett and Nanci Griffith, is a storyteller who can unfurl a sad-luck tale with genuine heart and a sardonic twinge. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212) 777-6800; $23.50 in advance, $30 at the door.(Sinagra)    LEO KOTTKE AND Mike GORDON (Tomorrow) The fingerpicking guitarist Leo Kottke and the former Phish bassist Mike Gordon have collaborated on two albums. The most recent is a collection of covers and originals informed by Mr. Gordon's affinity for calypso. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $30.(Sinagra)    MEDESKI, MARTIN & WOOD (Monday) Medeski, Martin & Wood's jams can take them in any direction, from old-fashioned organ funk to free jazz, but they know how to keep the dance floor happy. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 485-1534, $32. (Pareles)    THE MOUNTAIN GOATS (Tomorrow and Monday) John Darnielle, the singer-songwriter who records as the Mountain Goats, just released ''The Sunset Tree'' (4AD), one of the best albums of his career: a semi-autobiographical disc full of extraordinarily vivid little story-songs. Monday with Grizzly Bear. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14 (sold out). Monday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $14. (Kelefa Sanneh)    NEW YORK GYPSY FESTIVAL (Sunday though Nov. 6) The rage for Gypsy-rock dovetails nicely with this festival showcasing Romany music from Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia and the Balkans, ending in a show headlined by the Gypsy-punk band Gogol Bordello. This week's acts include Leningrad, VIA Romen, Kinos Hronos, Slavic Soul Party and the Bulgarian wedding musicians Ivo Papasov and Yuri Yunakov . Several locations; check www.nygypsyfest.com for schedule. Most shows are $10 to $15. (Sinagra)    OPETH (Thursday) This Swedish death-metal band has moved though progressive and even acoustic phases. Its long songs can travel in many directions, but recent material is more a return to form. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    VIRGINIA RODRIGUES (Tomorrow and Sunday) With her otherworldly voice, Virginia Rodrigues conjures a timeless, mystical Brazil, where nature meets spirit and the songs of Afro-Brazilian deities share the ethereality of Gregorian chants. 8 and 10 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; $20 at the bar, $30 at the table. (Pareles)    RASPUTINA (Monday) The cellist and singer Melora Creager leads this string trio of sawing goth rockers. Playing over heavy drum samples, they toggle between metallic distortion and clean-toned moodiness. Sarah Slean and Contramano also play. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    RAVI SHANKAR'S FESTIVAL OF INDIA IIi (Tonight) The four-part first half of Ravi Shankar's Festival of India III, conducted and led by the sitarist-composer's daughter Anoushka, includes a devotional prayer composed in 1974, as well as a tarana vocal piece composed of meaningless syllables, sung over a 16-beat tal. The second part of the program features father and daughter on sitar. Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $26 to $90. (Sinagra)    SLIPKNOT (Sunday, Monday and Tuesday) Lest anyone think life in the Midwest is all scrapbooking and apple pie, these self-styled Iowa miscreants put on a violent professional-wrestling-like show, spewing odes to teenage toxicity and violent boredom through holes in grotesque masks. 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $41. (Sinagra)    GIANMARIA TESTA (Tuesday) Gianmaria Testa, a part-time train stationmaster in Italy, writes terse, cozy songs suffused with romance and mystery. They're European cabaret tunes tinged with swing jazz and Latin music, and his smoky voice is knowing and enigmatic. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200; $20 with a two-drink or $12 minimum. (Pareles)    THRICE (Tuesday) This quartet plays a brainy version of emo-rock that looks to the Cure and Fugazi as influences. Dustin Kensrue breaks into rote screams with regularity, but the band is capable of impressive mood shifts. 7:30 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd, (212) 247-0200; $21.50 in advance, $25 at the door.(Sinagra)    VERUCA SALT (Tuesday) One of 90's alt-rock's most popular female-led bands, Veruca Salt had a huge hit with ''Seether,'' a melodic punk-pop chugger. Long separated from the group's co-founder, Nina Gordon, Louise Post is still slamming away at the power chords. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    GWEN STEFANI, BLACK EYED PEAS (Tuesday) Ms. Stefani, the tomboy-Barbie-doll lead singer of the pop-ska band No Doubt, was always destined for savvier collaborators. Her girl-nextdoor-meets-plastic-fashionista vibe is enhanced with top producers' hip-hop beats. With their saucy pop-hop, the Black Eyed Peas play cultural ambassadors to the hip-hop deprived. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $75. (Sinagra)    RUFUS WAINWRIGHT AND BAND (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Wainwright's piano-driven torch songs grapple with his musical birthright and cosmopolitan decadence. His brand of healing can be a scalding process, but he can be funny as well. In ''Gay Messiah'' he claims to reject any savior mantle, preferring instead to play a cheeky John the Baptist. Tuesday with the power-poppers OK GO, Wednesday with the smart singer-songwriter Regina Spektor, 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $35 to $40. (Sinagra)    KANYE WEST, KEYSHIA COLE, FANTASIA (Wednesday and Thursday) Kanye West made his name as a producer of tracks marked by sped-up vocal-soul samples. As a rapper, he artfully balances his considerable arrogance, guilt and thoughtfulness. That Mr. West's gift for the sad, slightly paranoid hook has only increased is evident in the current single, ''Gold Digger,'' which loops an arresting snip of Jamie Foxx shredding in Ray Charles mode. A protÃ©gÃ©e of Mr. West, Keyshia Cole wrings raw pathos from radio R & B fare. The ''American Idol'' darling Fantasia is also on the bill. 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212) 465-6741; $49.50 to $65. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

Tomorrow at 5:30 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; $30, with a $10 minimum. (Holden)    * ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight through Sunday) In a courageous and successful leap into the unknown, Ms. Stritch makes her cabaret debut at 80.

KARRIN ALLYSON (Wednesday through Nov. 5) On last year's ''Wild for You'' (Concord), Ms. Allyson slipped into a bath of sudsy soft rock; but she still peppers her performances with sharply rendered ballads and blues. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    SONNY FORTUNE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Since the 1960's, countless saxophonists have adopted the methodology of John Coltrane, but few have captured his restless spirit; Mr. Fortune, the saxophonist of choice for the former Coltrane drummer Elvin Jones, is chief among them. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

(Bernard Holland)    'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tonight and Sunday) The New York City Opera's production of this Rossini classic is an efficient, attractive frame for the composer's florid score, and the company has a generally strong cast, with Hugh Russell as Figaro, Jennifer Rivera as Rosina and John Tessier as the Count. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Allan Kozinn)    * 'LA CENERENTOLA' (Tonight) Olga Borodina's mezzo-soprano is slightly dark for the title role in Rossini's Cinderella story, but she has the clarity and agility to bring this virtuosic, richly ornamental music to life. Kenneth Tarver joins the cast as the Prince in this performance. The other singers in this comic-book production by Cesare Lievi include Simone Alberghini as Dandini and Simone Alaimo as Don Magnifico. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $205. (Kozinn)    'COSÃ FAN TUTTE'  (Tomorrow and Tuesday) This is the ultimate ensemble opera, and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production is an impressive ensemble effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. The soprano Barbara Frittoli and the mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena are endearing as the sisters whose devotion to their fiancÃ©s proves so ephemeral. Also winning are the fine lyric tenor Matthew Polenzani and the robust baritone Mariusz Kwiecien. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Monday and Thursday) Nicolas JoÃ«l's production of Donizetti's most popular opera seemed pointlessly opulent, murky and confusing when it was first presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 1998. The company has cleared away some of the clutter since then, and the production returns with new stage direction from Zoe Pappas. The cast, which looks to be strong, stars Elizabeth Futral as the mentally fragile Lucia. . 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini)    * 'THE MINES OF SULPHUR' (Wednesday) Contemporary opera has always been New York City Opera's soul, if not necessarily its bread and butter.

The superb cast includes Jessie Raven, Mark Duffin, Caroline Worra and Timothy Nolen. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Kozinn)    'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's 1998 production, now directed by Robin Guarino, has the virtue of letting Mozart's music and Da Ponte's libretto work their magic unhindered. The cast includes Lisa Milne as Susanna, Luca Pisaroni as Figaro, Hei-Kyung Hong as the Countess, and Joyce DiDonato as Cherubino and Peter Mattei as the Count. The conductor Mark Wigglesworth makes his house debut. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $65 to $110. (Kozinn)    'THE ORPHAN SINGER'  (Today) Drawn from a book by Emily Arnold McCully and adapted for the stage by Barbara Zinn Krieger, this multimedia musical, aimed at young audiences, explores Vivaldi's time as a music teacher at a girls orphanage in Venice. The production uses an all-female chamber ensemble and, as the promotional materials put it rather vaguely, a ''Broadway-quality cast.'' American Opera Projects is a co-sponsor. 11:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m., Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, 85 South Oxford Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 398-4024; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) This Puccini favorite has its final performance of the City Opera season. Carla Thelen Hanson makes a fine, darkly shaded Tosca, and Todd Thomas is a bold, swaggering Scarpia. On opening night, Jorge Antonio Pita sounded underpowered and somewhat strained as Cavaradossi. John Demain conducts. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Jeremy Eichler)    'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) New York City Opera brings back its old and oft-updated production, with the soprano Lori Phillips reprising the role of Puccini's Chinese princess. Philip Webb is her Calaf; George Manahan conducts. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Tuesday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Anne Midgette)    Classical Music    BRUCKNER ORCHESTRA LINZ (Wednesday) The orchestra has left Bruckner at home for its American debut under Dennis Russell Davies. Instead, Mr. Davies, a longtime Philip Glass champion, will lead the premiere of Mr. Glass's Symphony No. 8, along with his Symphony No. 6, ''Plutonian Ode'' (based on the eponymous poem by Allen Ginsberg), with the soprano Lauren Flanigan. 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60.

(Midgette)    VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Sunday) When he arrived from the Soviet Union in 1987, this pianist proclaimed that he was at least as interested in the European Classical repertory as in blockbusters from the Russian tradition. He bolsters his case here with two Beethoven sonatas, Nos. 8 (''PathÃ©tique'') and 31, and Mussorgsky's monumental ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $26 to $89. (James R. Oestreich)    KALICHSTEIN-LAREDO-ROBINSON TRIO  (Tuesday and Wednesday) Long the resident chamber ensemble at the 92nd Street Y, this warm-hued group offers Shostakovich's two piano trios, as well as Mozart's Trio in B flat (K. 502) and PÃ¤rt's quirky ''Mozart-Adagio,'' based on the slow movement from Mozart's Piano Sonata in F (K. 280). 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Kozinn)    ROBERT LEVIN (Thursday) Equally nimble as a pianist and as a musicologist, Robert Levin is the host of ''Mozart Explored,'' a series of concerts with commentary. He is joined by the Mendelssohn String Quartet and others. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35.

(Holland)    MANDELRING QUARTET (Sunday) This young German string quartet has won several European chamber music prizes and runs its own festival but is not yet well-known here. The intimate concert room at the Frick is a great place to discover these worthy performers. They can be heard there playing works by Schubert, Shostakovich and Beethoven. 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; sold out, but returned tickets may be available.

(Holland)    MIRÃ QUARTET (Tonight) Targeting hipness on the one hand, demonstrating a high degree of classical polish on the other, this fine string quartet celebrates its 10th anniversary with a program of composers with hearing problems: Beethoven, Smetana and Brent Michael Davids (''Tinnitus Quartet''). 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42. (Midgette)    IVAN MORAVEC (Monday) This venerable pianist plays Janacek and Debussy but mostly Chopin. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $23 to $79. (Holland)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) Announce the beloved violinist Itzhak Perlman playing and conducting Mozart, Schubert and Tchaikovsky, and you quickly sell out your house. Beginning Thursday, Gidon Kremer offers arguably more for the head and less for the heart: he is featured in Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 5, with Mikko Franck conducting; the Shostakovich Fifth and Beethoven's ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3 are also on the program. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. This weekend's concerts are sold out; $26 to $94 on Thursday. (Midgette)    NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS (Sunday) This estimable chamber chorus champions contemporary music and, true to its name, performs it with virtuosity. The singers present works by winners of its first annual composition competition, among them Devlyn Case, Joelle Wallach, David McMullin and Stephen Miles. There will also be works by two well-established American composers, George Perle and Augusta Read Thomas. Harold Rosenbaum conducts. 3 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (914) 763-3453; $15 suggested donation. (Tommasini)    ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Monday) Having found a new conductorless playmate, the orchestra performs for the first time with chorus. The estimable Kent Tritle, the innovative and tireless music director at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, is also the founding artistic and music director of the Bach Choir of New York, which joins the orchestra in Bach's Cantatas Nos. 48, 78 and 147 in the Met's Medieval Sculpture Hall. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $60. (Oestreich)    * REBEL (Wednesday) Two natural horn players, Wilhelm Bruns and Sebastien Salm, join this ensemble of Baroque specialists for works by Bach and Telemann, including some that draw on, or at least obliquely refer to, hunting calls. Included are Bach's First and Fifth ''Brandenburg'' Concertos and the Sinfonia from Cantata No. 174, as well as a Concerto Grosso and an Overture by Telemann. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35; $21 for students. (Kozinn)    ANDRAS SCHIFF (Tuesday) This estimable musician of the keyboard will divide his evening between Haydn and Beethoven. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $56. (Holland)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

The audience will be split into small groups and guided to each site and scene within a 19th-century church. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., the First Unitarian Church of Brooklyn, 121 Pierrepont Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 832-0018 or www.bax.org, $15, $12 students and 62. (Rockwell)    DONALD BYRD/SPECTRUM DANCE THEATER (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Byrd once again examines the cultural context of classical ballet, particularly through a black modern-dance choreographer's eyes, this time in ''The Sleeping Beauty Notebook,'' danced by the Spectrum Dance Theater of Seattle, which he directs. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $25.

(La Rocco)    DANCE AT THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) The first of two programs this week at the Factory features Ursula Eagly's new ''Nobody Try to Be a Hero,'' inspired by the Moscow theater hostage crisis, and Rebecca Davis's ''The Birds are here, I hear them'' , inspired by chemical compounds, classical Japanese poetry and concepts of time and memory. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. In the second program, the Lower Lights Collective will present ''Drawn,'' a series of simultaneous pieces taking place through the space that revolves around household objects and old, thrown-away wooden furniture. Thursday at 8 p.m. The Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 482-7069; $15; pay-what-you-will for Queens residents on Thursday.

(Dunning)    Golden Dragon Acrobats (Sunday) Contortions, swordplay, balancing acts; if done well, Chinese acrobatics can mesmerize. The best Chinese troupes tour the world, and this award-winning troupe has performed its family-oriented feats in more than 65 countries. 3 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $15 to $25.

Perhaps we'll find out when the Swiss dancer and choreographer Marie-Christine Giordano presents a premiere of this work for five dancers at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center. Womanhood is a frequent subject for Ms. Giordano, who used the difficulties of finding one's own voice as a daughter as starting point. 8 p.m. Theater 2, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $20; $15 for students, 65+ and artists. (La Rocco)    * Grupo Corpo (Through tomorrow) One of the foremost Brazilian dance troupes, mixing all manner of dance genres, with choreography by Rodrigo Pederneiras.

Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100 or www.bam.org; $20 to $60. (Rockwell)    JOYCE S. LIM AND PAZ TANJUAQUIO/TOPAZ Arts (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Lim's new ''splitting the night sky'' was inspired by her travels and research throughout Southeast and East Asia. Ms. Tanjuaquio's new ''Thunder Against 1.2.3.'' was inspired by a line from Tristan Tzara's 1918 Dada Manifesto. 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Dunning)    Jodi Melnick and Scott Heron (Tonight and tomorrow) What do Ms. Melnick's ''Wanderlust, Kentucky'' and Mr. Heron's ''Flossing and Other Dances'' have in common? Not much, it seems, but they're both solos by Bessie-winning performers, so why not premiere them together? 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20. (La Rocco)    PARSONS DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) David Parsons and his full-throttle dancers present his new ''DMB,'' to music by the Dave Matthews Band, and repertory including ''Wolfgang,'' a tribute to Mozart; and ''Shining Star,'' to music by Earth, Wind & Fire.

(Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by FabergÃ©. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Glueck).    * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street. (212) 535-7710. (Michael Kimmelman)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video-and-photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck)    Galleries: Uptown    'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections' This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits and drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 20. (Johnson)    'Yinka Shonibare Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8300, through May 7. (Johnson)    'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'Harry Kramer' The spirit of Abstract Expressionism lives on in the work of an artist who has been exhibiting in New York regularly since 1970. But Mr. Kramer's lusciously colored compositions of slashing gestures and planes of thick paint are more seductive than confrontational. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0051, through Nov. 5. (Johnson)    'Organic New York' This rewarding exhibition recalls an American trend of the 1940's that was eclipsed by Abstract Expressionism but has been brought back to life by many younger painters of today: surrealistic, biomorphic abstraction. It is loaded with swirling, symbolically charged paintings and sculptures by William Baziotes, Lee Krasner, Richard Pousette Dart, Mark Rothko and 15 others. Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, through Nov. 5. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Tim Bavington Modes of the 1960's, like spray-painted stripes and geometrically shaped canvases, are revived in attractive, multipaneled abstractions but with a contemporary conceptual twist. Mr. Bavington bases his compositional decisions on an obscure system by which he translates passages of old rock music from the aural to the visual. Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    Stephen Bush, 'Penetrol' This Australian painter presents partly abstract pictures of rustic cabins in alpine settings. Made in thick, viscous, partly brushed and partly poured enamel and oil paints in hallucinatory hues of hot pink, red and green, they suggest a kind of sentimental romance escalated into a gorgeous but frightening psychotic delusion. Goff + Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    'Contemporary Obscurists' Works by contemporary artists who use the camera obscura in variously inventive ways include Vera Lutter's huge negative image of an abandoned factory interior; Shi Guorui's ghostly, panoramic view of Shanghai; and Abelardo Morell's magical photographs of bedrooms with upside-down views of the city projected onto their interior walls. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    Chris Doyle, 'Flight Power Love Tower' A startling, semi-abstract sculpture of a giant, illuminated flying eagle made of slender lengths of wood and long fluorescent lights fills the front exhibition space. One of the amusing stop-action videos in the back shows the artist flying through his studio. Jessica Murray, 150 Eleventh Avenue, near 22nd Street, (212) 633-9606, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    Franklin Evans, 'freakout' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    ROY LICHTENSTEIN: 'CONVERSATIONS WITH SURREALISM' In its swank, newly opened downtown outpost, a blue-chip uptown gallery is showing eight examples of this famous Pop artist's indelibly cartoonized, also swank borrowings from Surrealism. Mitchell Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, through Nov. 12. (Smith).    Other Galleries    * AndrÃ© KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)    'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)    * 'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). Saint-Gaudens's own work appears in it, too; surprisingly, it doesn't seem all that far out of context. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck)    * 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith).    Zhou Xiaohu The best works in an unfocused presentation of efforts in various media by this versatile Chinese artist are the haunting, darkly comical Claymation videos depicting scenes like the trial of Saddam Hussein, a political assassination and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. Ethan Cohen, 18 Jay Street, near Hudson Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, through Nov. 12.(Johnson)    Last Chance    CANDICE BREITZ In four video pieces, the words of Hollywood actresses and actors are reconfigured into a conversation about parenting, and unknown fans of Madonna and Michael Jackson sing for the camera, alone yet together. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1018, closing tomorrow. (Smith).    ANTHONY BURDIN In his second solo show in New York, this idiosyncratic multimedia Los Angeles artist takes over all four levels of the gallery's funky space, showing his wildly improvised, distinctly lived-in music videos, a series of small exquisite drawings and an installation involving some of the byproducts of his nomadic life. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, near Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 431-4977, closing on Monday. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'Ãªtre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, closing on Sunday. . (Glueck)    * MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American Modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212) 966-5154, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    * 'MY HAND OUTSTRETCHED: FILMS BY ROBERT BEAVERS' As if from the forehead of Zeus, this midcareer retrospective introduces the ravishing, impeccably structured art of an avant-garde filmmaker who ranks with the best of his generation. Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, closing Sunday . (Smith).    * Evan Penny: 'No-One In Particular' This Toronto-based sculptor creates astoundingly realistic and, in some cases, weirdly distorted bigger-than-life busts of people out of silicone, rubber, hair and other materials. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, closing tomorrow.

A family musical by Stephen Schwartz (''Wicked'') about a lonely young boy whose overactive imagination sends him dreaming on Halloween night (55 minutes). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.    'JERSEY BOYS' Opens Nov. 6.

Patti LuPone and Michael Cerveris star in this intimate revival of the Sondheim classic, featuring 10 actors who play their own instruments. It started at the Watermill Theater in England, before moving to the West End and Broadway (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.    Broadway    'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clichÃ©s of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Ben Brantley).    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY' Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of the great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Anne Midgette).    'THE BLOWIN OF BAILE GALL' Ronan Noone's play concerns the complicated relationships among four laborers and a general contractor renovating a house in Ireland. Mr. Noone draws his characters sharply and surely, but the play is overburdened with conflict. There's enough here to fuel a whole season of a television soap (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444.(Isherwood)    'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers that she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'EINSTEIN'S GIFT'  Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, we only use street locators for avenues.(212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel McIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)    'THE MASTER BUILDER'  A revival that succeeds mainly through a fine performance by Dan Daily as the superstar architect of the title. Mr. Daily brings the character's tangle of contradictions together in a credible performance that manages to find the hidden troll in the artistic genius (2:20). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802.(Wilborn Hampton)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Jefferson)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    'SLUT'  This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Miriam Horn)    *'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer-Prize winning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. (Brantley).    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jefferson)    'WAR IN PARAMUS'  It is supposedly 1970 in Barbara Dana's new family drama, but you'd hardly know it from the generic troubles on display: two clueless parents, two polar-opposite daughters, two crises that could be from any time between the 1950's and today, only obligatory references to the war and the strife of the period (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger).    Off Off Broadway    'THE ASPHALT KISS' Everything in Nelson Rodgrigues's play is exaggerated, from the deliberately melodramatic situation to the repetitive language, enunciated with Mamet-like emphasis. The strange intensity of the play, with its consciously stilted dialogue and acting, may not be to everyone's taste. But this production is an intriguing sample of Rodrigues's highly original voice (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'SAINT OEDIPUS' Combines actors and puppets with Greek and Christian myth to create a fierce, virtuosic theater piece (1:10). The Wierszalin Theater of Poland at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710. (Jefferson)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30).

(Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.

(Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    * 'CRESTFALL' Taking place in a town described by one character as ''this insidious vicinity, the savage quarter, this perpetual crestfall,'' this speeding train of a play, which features three interconnected monologues spoken by a sex addict, a frigid woman and a whore, reveals a writer who loves words almost as much as he does dirty jokes and bloody faces. Since he made his first American splash with ''Howie the Rookie'' in 2001, Mark O'Rowe, who writes likes a mix of Samuel Beckett and Martin McDonagh, has grown in confidence, if not in maturity (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    'LATE FRAGMENT'  Matthew, a World Trade Center employee who survived Sept. 11, and Marta are a desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama, titled after a Raymond Carver poem. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to diffuse it with less-than-credible moments (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'THE MARILYN TAPES' This doting biographical musical sticks to the highlights of Marilyn Monroe's life with a concentration on romance. Even if Lenore Zann isn't exactly the spit and image of Monroe -- which the Bert Stern photographs in the lobby make clear -- fans of the star will find her mannerisms and, most impressively, her agile, breathy voice quite convincing (1:30). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)352-3101, closing Sunday.(Zinoman)    *'MEDEA' Sure, she gets most of the attention, but let's take a moment to acknowledge Jason, who, as embodied by Lawrence Winslow in the Classical Theater of Harlem's jolting production, contributes some terrific laughs to Euripides' grim tragedy. Yeah, that's right: laughs, the kind you get from the incongruity of the good ol' boys' network's encountering Gloria Steinem (1:10). Classical Theater of Harlem, at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday.(Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'BEFORE THE FALL' (No rating, 110 minutes, in German) Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside one of Hitler's elite schools (used to indoctrinate future leaders) to observe the fate of a young amateur boxer and his sensitive roommate. Though somewhat overdetermined, the film is a chilling testament to the seductiveness of groupthink and the allure of imagined superiority.(Jeannette Catsoulis)    *BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott)    *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le CarrÃ©'s novel. (Scott)    *'DOMINO' (R, 113 minutes) A lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills from Tony Scott about the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey. (Manohla Dargis)    'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)    'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Dargis)    'THE FOG' (PG-13, 100 minutes) This occasionally scary remake is about a dense, mysterious fog that hides vengeful spirits with a century-old grudge against an Oregon seaside town. At least there's a good-looking young cast, led by Tom Welling of ''Smallville'' and Maggie Grace of ''Lost.'' (Anita Gates)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    *'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    'THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED' (PG, 115 minutes) A rousing, obvious re-creation of the 1913 United States Open, in which two sons of the working classes faced off in a game still dominated, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the well-born. Aims for par and makes it. (Scott)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)    * 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy, best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests. (Dargis)    'INNOCENT VOICES' (R, 120 minutes, in Spanish) Alternately powerful and mawkish, ''Innocent Voices'' remembers the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980's through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy from a rural village who faces forcible conscription into the army. (Stephen Holden)    'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)    'LOGGERHEADS' (No rating, 95 minutes) There is so much that is tender and true in Tom Kirkman's sensitively acted film about adoption that the few times it pauses to flaunt its metaphorical conceit about loggerhead turtles, you just have to grit your teeth and wait for the twitches of literary pretension to subside. (Holden)    'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Gates)    'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)    *'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)    * 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)    * 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)    'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)    'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)    'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)    'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)    'WHERE the TRUTH LIES' (No rating, 107 minutes) Atom Egoyan's drama about a fictional comedy team from the 1950's features an overly knotty murder mystery, a mess of blondes and two fine performances from Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth. (Dargis)    FILM SERIES    AFTER WAR (Through Sunday) The Japan Society's commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, a series of works about wartime and its aftermath, concludes on Sunday.

(Gates)    NARUSE: THE UNKNOWN JAPANESE MASTER (Through Nov. 17) Film Forum's four-week retrospective of the films of the Japanese director Mikio Naruse begins this weekend with ''When a Woman Ascends the Stairs'' (1960), about a young widow working in a Ginza nightclub. Next week's features include two 1953 films: ''Wife,'' about a salaryman with a useless spouse, and ''Older Brother, Younger Sister,'' about a domineering rural man with a brawler son and a pregnant daughter. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212)727-8110; $10. (Gates)    NEW FRENCH CONNECTION (Through Oct. 30) BAMcinÃ©matek's fourth annual program of contemporary French films begins on Wednesday with Raymond Depardon's ''Profiles of Farmers: Daily Life'' (2005), a sequel to his 2001 documentary on the same subject.

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100; $10. (Gates)    NO VISA REQUIRED: FILMS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST (Through Nov. 19) The TriBeCa Film Institute and ArteEast are collaborating on a five-program screening of six films, followed by discussions with the filmmakers. The event continues tomorrow with a double feature. Elia Suleiman's Israeli/Palestinian ''Chronicle of a Disappearance'' (1996) is a series of vignettes about daily life in Nazareth and Jerusalem and their environs. Fouad Elkoury's ''Happy Days in Palestine'' (1998) is a French documentary about pre-Israeli settlers. Cantor Film Center, New York University, 36 East Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)941-3890; $10. (Gates)    SOME LIKE IT WILDER: THE COMPLETE BILLY WILDER (Through Nov. 13) The Museum of the Moving Image is sponsoring a 26-film retrospective of Wilder, the Austrian-born director-writer who gave the world ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''Double Indemnity.'' This weekend's features are ''The Emperor Waltz'' (1948), Wilder's only musical, starring Bing Crosby and Joan Fontaine; ''One, Two, Three'' (1961), a cold-war satire starring James Cagney; and ''Five Graves to Cairo'' (1943), a wartime propaganda thriller with Franchot Tone, Anne Baxter and Erich von Stroheim (as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel). 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE (Tonight) The manic Japanese guitarist Kawabata Makoto leads his long-running band in hard-rocking psychedelic explorations rooted in riffy dirt-rock. 7:30, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Laura Sinagra)    BEHOLD THE ARCTAPUS, THE ILLEGIBLE DJ CAPS (Sunday) Behold the Arctapus plays smart heavy metal. DJ Caps is one-half of the Caps-n-Jones duo responsible for this year's sublime mix ''Moving in Stereo.'' Hexa also play. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    JELLO BIAFRA AND THE MELVINS (Sunday) The sardonic frontman of the former California punk band the Dead Kennedys now pops up frequently as a talking head for music nostalgia documentaries. Teaming with the proto-grunge Seattle rockers the Melvins, he's still playing jokester on albums like ''Sieg Howdy'' (Alternative Tentacles). 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $17. (Sinagra)    JON BRION (Tuesday) This multi-instrumentalist and producer's scrapped (but widely downloaded) material for Fiona Apple's new CD created a stir. Now he takes time off from such sonic midwifery, film scoring and playing gigs weekly at a Los Angeles cabaret to display his own versatile pop prowess. 7:30 and 10 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    TRACY CHAPMAN (Tonight) This singer-songwriter's angsty pop-folk song ''Fast Car,'' a kind of anti-''Born To Run,'' became an instant classic when late-1980's recession sank in, offering a working-class escape fantasy so modest that it was heartbreaking. 6:30, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)564-4882; $39. (Sinagra)    BRUCE COCKBURN (Tomorrow) The smoky-voiced Canadian folk-rocker Bruce Cockburn is just as opinionated and oppositional as he was when he wrote the anti-imperial ''If I Had a Rocket Launcher,'' though recently he has been letting his guitar do the emoting. 8 p.m., Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, www.concertstonight.com, (212)307-7171 ;$30 to $35.(Sinagra)    CREAM (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) All the members of the 60's British power trio behind ''White Room,'' and ''Badge'' are alive and well, but top dollar is required to see if Eric Clapton's slow hand has gotten slower, or the bassist Jack Bruce's bellow less blustery. Ginger Baker's drumming remains agile. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741 ; $64.50 to $354.50. (Sinagra)    VICENTE FERNANDEZ (Tonight) In Mexico, Vicente Fernandez is a household name, a television star who owes his fame to songs about loving, crying and suffering. With his dramatic tenor voice and his wall-shaking vibrato, Mr. Fernandez brings out all the melodrama of Mexican ranchera songs that bounce and laugh as they detail vast heartaches. 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $54.50-$149.50. (Jon Pareles)    ORENDA FINK (Tomorrow) One-half of the ethereal female duo Azure Ray, Ms. Fink performs her own songs, atmospheric alt-rock that draws on her travels to Haiti, Cambodia and India. She opens for the former Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village (212)353-1600; $20. (Sinagra)    FREAKWATER, JOHN PARISH (Thursday) Catherine Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean of Freakwater harmonize like a country duo from decades ago, calmly examining all the disappointments and morbid fantasies -- heartache, suicide, children's deaths -- of a hard life in the boondocks. Now and then, a proudly clever line signals that they're not as rural as they might sound. John Parish has been an essential collaborator for P.J. Harvey and the Eels, playing guitar and keyboard parts distilled to a stark simplicity. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $12. (Pareles)    GANGBE BRASS BAND (Tomorrow) This 10-piece band from Benin in West Africa melds upbeat Yoruban music with global jazz and pop, singing in several of Benin's indigenous languages and French. 10 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $25 to $37. (Sinagra)    PATTERSON HOOD (Tuesday) One of three songwriters in his southern-rock band, the Drive-by Truckers, Patterson Hood possesses an eclectic pop sensibility that perfectly balances his bandmates' honky-tonk jams and southern-gothic anthems. 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $14. (Sinagra)    JAMIROQUA (Monday and Tuesday) Taking its cues from Stevie Wonder, this British dance-pop band led by the madly hatted singer Jay Kay had a hit in the 90's with the blandly groovy ''Virtual Insanity,'' and gained more a jam-band than a dance-music following. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $40. (Sinagra)    JOHN LEGEND (Thursday) The piano-romancing crooner John Legend, a dapper Kanye West protÃ©gÃ©, plays retro soul music with hip-hop cred and a teasingly rough edge. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)749-5838 or (212)864-0372; $45 to $65. (Sinagra)    MAGIK MARKERS (Tomorrow) This noise-rock trio's sound assaults build from shirring buzz and ominous clang to maelstroms of bash and feedback. Kicking and jerking as the spirit moves her, the vocalist-guitarist Elisa Ambrogio surges from hiss to howl, wrestling with her guitar to choke out its most dangerous peals. The group plays between the Ex-Models and Pterodactyl. 10- p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503; $8. (Sinagra)    JAMES MCMURTRY (Tomorrow and Sunday) James McMurtry packs a lot of story into his low-key songs: tales of loners and losers adrift in wide-open spaces. His voice is deadpan, but his characters survive grand struggles. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $15. (Pareles)    MILTON NASCIMENTO (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) Since his heyday in the early 1970's, the versatile Brazilian singer and songwriter Milton Nascimento has been making experimental jazz-pop that often features inventive vocal improvisations. 8 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; $30.(Sinagra)    ONEIDA (Tonight) The Brooklyn noise-rockers Oneida are a versatile bunch, sliding album to album from hard squall to heavy riffs to Krautrock precision--and, more recently, to droning meditations that seem a sonic correlate to time-lapse images of gathering storm clouds. 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    THE RAPTURE (Tonight) This Brooklyn band tops its tight dance-punk grooves with the rhythmically yelping panic of the vocalist Luke Jenner, whose tone recalls the Cure's Robert Smith. 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE ROGERS SISTERS, SCOUT NIBBLET (Wednesday) Though the Brooklyn power-trio the Rogers Sisters have plied their perky new-wave craft during the recent spate of 80's revivalism in Williamsburg, they take themselves less seriously than most. Scout Nibblet makes stripped-down alt-rock in the vein of early P.J. Harvey. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Thursday) The sitarist Anoushka Shankar, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $30. (Pareles)    SOUL ASYLUM (Wednesday) The scruffy alt-rock band Soul Asylum, best known for the strummy 90's hit ''Runaway Train,'' pays musical tribute to its bassist, Karl Mueller, who died of cancer this year. Tommy Stinson of the Replacements will play bass. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)    STEW (Monday) This Los Angeles pop craftsman writes songs that slip just enough bitters into the 70's lite rock cocktail to make it subversive. His faux-big production on disc isn't required live, because his songs are cabaret to the core. And aside from chuckling at his own asides, he is a consummate performer. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $15 . (Sinagra)    RICHARD THOMPSON, DANNY THOMPSON (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock's smartest misanthrope is also one of its greatest guitarists. Mr. Thompson, one of the architects of British trad-rock in the 1960's, writes songs steeped in Celtic melody and the stoicism of traditional ballads. Then he plugs them in, adding some rock twang, and plays solos that ring with ancient modes and climb harmonic walls. His guitarist son Danny joins him. 9 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824; $25. (Pareles)    MARTHA WAINWRIGHT (Tuesday) Like her parents, Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright, the folk singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright can be roundly sad or quippishly tart. Like her brother Rufus, whose taste in furniture she sings about with proud envy, she's a talented drizzler of faint praise. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    HANK WILLIAMS III (Thursday) Diverging from Hank Williams Jr.'s caricature, this country music scion plays countrified alt-rock without milking his heritage. His voice has the high, lonesome twang, but his concerns are up to the minute. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    SUZANNE VEGA (Thursday) With her cool, matter-of-fact delivery on 80's hits like ''Luka'' and ''Tom's Diner,'' this singer-songwriter sings from that sometimes spooky emotional space where the quotidian mirrors the tragic. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)501-1390; $32 to $38. (Sinagra)    WOLF PARADE (Monday) Another of the art-pop bands from Montreal that include Arcade Fire and Unicorns, Wolf Parade has a Northern noir take on keyboard-heavy epics. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $14 (sold out). (Sinagra)    ZAKK WYLDE BLACK LABEL SOCIETY (Wednesday) Mr. Wylde, the heavy-metal guitarist best known for his stints with Ozzy Osbourne's band, is outspoken on matters of sex, beer and country. He loves them all. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $28. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

(Bernard Holland)    'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEUE' (Tomorrow) Paul Dukas's mysterious 1907 opera tells the legend of Duke Bluebeard and his disappearing wives from a woman's point of view. That this rich work has become a rarity is inexplicable. Thanks go to the New York City Opera for this new production, suitably Symbolist in look. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Anthony Tommasini)    'IL BARBiERe DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow) The New York City Opera's production of this Rossini classic is an efficient, attractive frame for the composer's florid score, and the company has a generally strong cast, with Hugh Russell as Figaro, Jennifer Rivera as Rosina and John Tessier as the Count. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Allan Kozinn)    'LA CENERENTOLA' (Monday) Olga Borodina's mezzo-soprano is slightly dark for the title role in Rossini's Cinderella story, but she has the clarity and agility to bring this virtuosic, richly ornamental music to life. The rest of the cast is well matched in this comic-book production by Cesare Lievi. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $175.

The always imaginative Ms. Melnick presents events that ''may or may not have happened'' in ''Wanderlust, Kentucky,'' and Mr. Heron performs the irresistibly titled ''Flossing''-- in which he will apparently assume the dual personas of a box of dental floss and the tooth fairy. Also on the program are ''3X Donovan'' and a premiere, ''Gumdrops and Cupcakes.'' 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; students, ages 65+ and artists, $12.

(Dunning)    LIT (Tomorrow) Otherwise known as ''Loft Into Theater,'' this showcase celebrates the work of eight choreographers from leading modern-dance groups and the funky yet pristine setting in which their pieces will be performed. 8 p.m., Hundred Grand, 100 Grand Street, at Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)926-6573; $15; students and 65+, $12. (Dunning)    LUIS LARA MALVACÃAS (Tonight through Sunday night) ''Badman,'' for an all-male cast, creates an environment in which social codes regulating definitions of masculinity break down. 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194; $15. (Anderson)    NEW YORK BUTOH FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) The performers appearing in the closing days of this ambitious festival are Kan Katsura in his new ''Time Machine,'' and Azumaru performing to music by Jack Wright (both tonight at 7), and Masaki Iwana in his new ''Beast of Grass'' (tonight at 9:30).

Tonight and Tuesday through Thursday nights at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $40. (Dunning)    THE STORY OF TAP (THE SEQUEL) (Tonight and tomorrow night) Hank Smith is host of weekend programs in which some of the leading tap dancers in New York converse and dance. 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, SoHo, (212)219-0736, Ext. 110, or www.dixonplace.org; $10 to 15; advance tickets $12 at theatermania.com. (Anderson)    ANN LIV YOUNG (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dance joins forces with words, singing and narrative in ''Michael,'' an erotically charged dance set inside a 42-foot-long trailer decorated with Victorian floral wallpaper and prim furniture. The choreographer says her production is for mature audiences only. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; students and 60+, $12. (Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'Ãªtre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)    *THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by FabergÃ©. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Glueck).    *JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212)423-3200. (Glueck)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video-and-photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13. During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676. (Glueck)    Galleries: Uptown    'Yinka Shonibare Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8300, through May 6. (Johnson)    'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'Harry Kramer' The spirit of Abstract Expressionism lives on in the work of an artist who has been exhibiting in New York regularly since 1970. But Mr. Kramer's lusciously colored compositions of slashing gestures and planes of thick paint are more seductive than confrontational. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through Nov. 5. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'Contemporary Obscurists' Works by contemporary artists who use the camera obscura in variously inventive ways include Vera Lutter's huge negative image of an abandoned factory interior; Shi Guorui's ghostly, panoramic view of Shanghai; and Abelardo Morell's magical photographs of bedrooms with upside-down views of the city projected onto their interior walls. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212)741-4764, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    Franklin Evans, 'freakout' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212)989-0156, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    YINKA SHONIBARE: 'MOBILITY' This British sculptor presents two spare installations using his signature post-colonialist symbol: the headless mannequin in 19th-century European clothes cut from African fabrics. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    Sue Williams Few artists have combined figurative abstract painting and existential disgust as variously and effectively as Sue Williams has, and the trajectory continues in this show of new work. Here the battered body parts and de Kooning-esque swipes of the past have been distilled into a tumorous universe of genitals, anuses and noxious emissions, as the biological becomes political. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)255-1121, through Oct. 29. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    *AndrÃ© KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)    'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212)213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)    LineAge: 'Selections Fall 2005' Among works by nine emerging artists in this entertaining show are poetic, notarized documents by CarianaCarianne, who claims to be two people in one body; intricately cutout linear abstractions by Adam Fowler; big drawings of human navels by Susan D'Amato; and a sculpture by Monika Grzymala, made by wrapping 4.4 miles of paper tape around three columns in the gallery. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)219-2166, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    *MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American Modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212)966-5154, through Oct. 29. (Smith)    *'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). Saint-Gaudens's own work appears in it, too; surprisingly, it doesn't seem all that far out of context. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212)713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck)    *Evan Penny: 'No-One In Particular' This Toronto-based sculptor creates astoundingly realistic and, in some cases, weirdly distorted bigger-than-life busts of people out of silicone, rubber, hair and other materials. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)999-7337, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    Last Chance    *Robert Bordo A beautiful, quietistic show by a painter whose work always manages to be both grounded and ethereal, soundless and resonant, abstract and not. Mr. Bordo is at midcareer. The time for a retrospective view is at hand. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)367-7474, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    *Adam Dant: 'Standing under' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    Claire Fontaine Politically charged works by this French artist include a neon-light work that outlines the image of a hooded Iraqi prisoner and child; a neon sign in the gallery's front window that says in Arabic, ''Foreigners Everywhere''; and a tiny sculpture called ''In God We Trust'' in the form of a 25-cent coin with a fold-out box cutter secreted inside. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)477-5006, closing today. (Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON'  Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    'Tracking Suburbia' AND 'Do You Like Stuff?' From Jean-FrÃ©dÃ©ric Schnyder's more-than-30-foot-long photograph of every building on the road between two Swiss towns in ''Tracking Suburbia'' to Frank Olive's countertop display of 100 items you could buy cheaply in a drugstore in ''Do You Like Stuff?,'' these two smart and wry group shows invite meditation on modern materialism. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, SoHo, (212)925-2035, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show says. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600, closing on Sunday. (Michael Kimmelman)    NEIL WELLIVER: 'A MEMORIAL EXHIBITION,' Five large paintings from the late 1970's and early 80's make an exhilarating tribute to this esteemed painter of Maine landscapes, who died last April at 75. Measuring up to 8 by 10 feet, the canvases depict dense woods, a rocky summit and marshland with beaver dams, and they are painted with generous, wide-brush strokes and a keen eye for natural light and texture. They are at once vividly realistic, expressively abstract and sensuously physical. Alexandre, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    HENRY WOLF Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, closing tomorrow.

(Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.''

O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    * 'CRESTFALL' Taking place in a town described by one character as ''this insidious vicinity, the savage quarter, this perpetual crestfall,'' the speeding train of a play, which features three interconnected monologues spoken by a sex addict, a frigid woman and a whore, reveals a writer who loves words almost as much as he does dirty jokes and bloody faces. Since he made his first American splash with ''Howie the Rookie'' in 2001, Mark O'Rowe, who writes likes a mix of Samuel Beckett and Martin McDonagh, has grown in confidence, if not in maturity (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'EINSTEIN'S GIFT'  Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and the potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR' The Peccadillo Theater Company has revived this 1953 play by Dorothy Parker and Arnaud D'Usseau. A comedy set in an East Side hotel populated by widows and divorcÃ©es, it is an unyielding and coruscating portrait of women before feminism, relieved by Parker's dead-on wit. East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Honor Moore)    'LATE FRAGMENT'  Matthew, a World Trade Center employee who survived Sept. 11, and Marta are a desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama named after a Raymond Carver poem. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to diffuse it with less-than-credible moments (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)    'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel McIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)    'THE MASTER BUILDER'  A revival that succeeds mainly through a fine performance by Dan Daily as the superstar architect of the title. Mr. Daily brings the character's tangle of contradictions together in a credible performance that manages to find the hidden troll in the artistic genius (2:20). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802.(Wilborn Hampton)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Jefferson)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Zinoman)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    'SLUT'  This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Miriam Horn)    'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jefferson)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100.

(Brantley)    *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT' Garrett Ayers, who calls his latest company the TryTryAgain Theater, says this is his third attempt at staging this short play from 1961 by Joel Oppenheimer. It's fun. It's performed with spunk. It's got cowboys. Sure, it's indecipherable, but hey, it's less than an hour long (55 minutes). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (800)838-3006, closing Sunday.( Genzlinger)    *'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' In Rolin Jones's fanciful comedy, playfully directed by Jackson Gay, a lonely young woman in California embarks on an ambitious science project to help conquer her agoraphobia and trace her origins in China. Brisk, funny and engaging, the play disappoints only in its emphasis on flights of fancy over a nuanced depiction of its heroine's emotional dilemmas (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200, closing tomorrow.(Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of the show's impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Anne Midgette)    *'POOR THEATER' Part homage and part anatomy, the Wooster Group's warm, witty tribute to the director Jerzy Grotowski and the choreographer William Forsythe demonstrates how imitation can be not just sincere flattery but also a hopeful attempt to crawl into someone else's skin to see how it fits. As identities and their representations morph and blur, this is not always a comfortable activity, but it is often an exhilarating one (1:30). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BEFORE THE FALL' (No rating, 110 minutes, in German) Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside one of Hitler's elite schools used to indoctrinate future leaders to observe the fate of a young amateur boxer and his sensitive roommate. Though somewhat overdetermined, the film is a chilling testament to the seductiveness of groupthink and the allure of imagined superiority.(Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (A.O. Scott)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott)     *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le CarrÃ©'s novel. (Scott)       'DANDELION' (No rating, 93 minutes) Mark Milgard's debut film is an affectedly glum slice of life about a depressed teenager in rural Washington State who takes the rap for his father after a hit-and-run accident. (Stephen Holden)     'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)    'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)    'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Manohla Dargis)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)     *'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    'GOING SHOPPING' (PG-13, 106 minutes) As loquacious and scatterbrained as its female characters, this Henry Jaglom film explores women's shopping habits and fantasies. Its incomplete sketches revolve around an upscale dress shop on the verge of bankruptcy. (Holden)    'THE GOSPEL' (PG, 105 minutes) Set against a lively, music-filled African-American church, ''The Gospel,'' written and directed by Rob Hardy, and with many talented real-life gospel superstars blended into the large and able cast, endeavors to be a powerful tale of faith and forgiveness, but in the end fails to capture even the slightest essence of spirituality and religious belief, or to provide any real insight into its characters' conflicts, desires and motivations.(Laura Kern)     'THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED' (PG, 115 minutes) A rousing, obvious re-creation of the 1913 United States Open, in which two sons of the working classes faced off in a game still dominated, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the well-born. Aims for par and makes it. (Scott)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)     * 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 yes, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson (''L. A. Confidential'') wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests.(Dargis)    'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)      'LORD OF WAR' (R, 122 minutes) A misfire of a political satire about the international gun market from Andrew Niccol, a filmmaker whose words say no, but whose overworked visual style says lock and load, baby. (Dargis)     'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Anita Gates)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)     * 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)    * 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)      'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)    'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)    'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)    * 'TOUCH THE SOUND' (No rating, 99 minutes) As Thomas Riedelsheimer's enlightening, mystical documentary follows the deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie around the globe, it illustrates her understanding that sound is a physical sensation experienced throughout the body, as well as an auditory one. (Holden)    'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)       * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)   FILM SERIES    AFTER WAR (Through Oct. 23) The Japan Society is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II with this series of works about wartime and its aftermath.

(Jon Pareles)    JUNIOR BROWN, ABIGAIL WASHBURN (Tuesday) Junior Brown has his own instrument: the doublenecked ''guit-steel'' allows him to play biting electric guitar leads in one verse and suave steel guitar in the next. In most of his music he's a country traditionalist, true to honky-tonk tempos and the deadpan baritone vocal style of Ernest Tubb. Every so often he lets loose a Jimi Hendrix lick. Abigail Washburn opens. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles)    CARL COX (Tomorrow) The British D.J.

(Sinagra)    DEVENDRA BANHART (Thursday) Mr. Banhart's eerie, wavery voice and stream-of-consciousness songs reach back to the childlike surrealism of some of psychedelia's most beloved oddballs: Syd Barrett and the preglam rock of Marc Bolan. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600;$20 in advance, $25 at the door.

(Sinagra)    FOO FIGHTERS, WEEZER, HOT HOT HEAT (Tonight) Dave Grohl, the former Nirvana drummer, has been leading the energetic alt-rock Foo Fighters for a decade, proving that cocky affability goes a long way. The nerd-pop masters Weezer continue to write textbook pop melodies, but their scruffiest album, 1996's ''Pinkerton'' (Geffen) is the favorite of a fanatical cult of emo kids. The peppy rockers Hot Hot Heat open. 7 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900; $30.50 to $42.50. (Sinagra)    FRANZ FERDINAND, TV ON THE RADIO (Monday) At the vanguard of the post -- post-punk trend, the poker-faced Franz Ferdinand plays herky-jerky party music.

(Pareles)    KRISTIN HERSH (Sunday) The singer-songwriter, who led the mid-90's band Throwing Muses and found underground fame giving punk rock a twist of Wiccan ethereality, continues to make unflinching music about the modern female condition, among other things. 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132; $14.

(Sinagra)    JUANA MOLINA (Thursday) The reveries of the Argentine songwriter Juana Molina are built from her acoustic guitar picking, her hushed voice, melodies with the simplicity of lullabies and rustling, rippling, melting synthesizer backdrops that fill the songs with mystery. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $15. (Pareles)    JASON MRAZ, RAUL MIDON (Sunday and Monday) Jason Mraz plays countrified, roots pop in the coffeehouse vein.

(Sinagra)    LIZ PHAIR, MATT POND (Monday and Tuesday) One of the 90's most riveting indie-rock singer-songwriters, the smart, sexually candid Liz Phair has been angling for a radio hit for a few albums now. Her new ''Somebody's Miracle'' (Capitol) is again too quirky for MTV, but too slick-sounding for indie devotees. Opener Matt Pond writes pleasing, if forgettable, pop songs. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $25. (Sinagra)    SON VOLT, FRUIT BATS (Wednesday) Son Volt's Jay Farrar, the gruff-voiced, country-rock half of the seminal alt-country band Uncle Tupelo, has gone in a different direction from his former bandmate, Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, preferring stolid reflection to stylistic adventurism. The ruminative folk-pop band the Fruit Bats opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    SUPERPITCHER, ADA (Wednesday) The German producer Aksel Schaufler, aka Superpitcher, can make pure electropop as well as create a mood of glitchy claustrophobia.

(Sinagra)    ROB THOMAS (Tuesday and Wednesday) The singer for the popular rock group Matchbox 20 is remaking himself as a pinup boy and trying his hand at hip-hop-inflected pop songs.

(Sinagra)    U2, KEANE (Tonight) After 2000's thrilling ''All That You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), U2's latest album, ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope), and its ''Vertigo'' tour focus on what humans can live without: namely, intercontinental ballistic missiles and, evidently, some of U2's more shopworn live staples. Hence the resurrection of decades-old rarities like ''Electric Co.''

(Pareles)    WACO BROTHERS BLOODSHOT REVUE (Tonight) Jon Langford of the Mekons indulges his country side even more strongly in the Waco Brothers, where he trades off lead vocals with Dean Schlabowske and ricochets between revolution and beer-soaked self-pity while letting his electric guitar blare. The Mekons' Sally Timms joins the bill. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $14.

Opera    'AIDA' (Tonight, Tuesday) The Aida of the rich-voiced soprano MichÃ¨le Crider and the Amneris of the formidable mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick are sure bets. What fans of ''Aida'' will be curious about when Sonja Frisell's production returns to the Metropolitan Opera is the Radames of the tenor Salvatore Licitra, who has yet to live up to the promise of his dramatic Met debut in 2002 as a last-minute replacement for Luciano Pavarotti. James Conlon conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $205.(Anthony Tommasini)    'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEUE' (Tonight, Sunday) Paul Dukas's mysterious 1907 opera tells the legend of the fearsome Duke Bluebeard and his strangely disappearing wives from a woman's point of view. In its day the work was mentioned along with Debussy's ''PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande'' as a prime achievement of the post-Wagnerian French school. That this rich work has become a rarity is inexplicable. Thanks go to the New York City Opera for this new production, which is suitably Symbolist in look. It's too bad that the musical performance under the conductor Leon Botstein is so heavy-handed. Renate Behle brings Wagnerian intensity to the role of Ariane. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Tommasini)    'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow, Thursday) Hugh Russell, by all accounts a sweet-voiced baritone, makes his debut with the New York City Opera in the title role of Rossini's perennial favorite, joining Jennifer Rivera (as Rosina) and John Tessier (as Almaviva). Joseph Rescigno conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Thursday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Anne Midgette)    'LA BOHÃME' (Tomorrow, Sunday) Pity a small opera company: it receives critical attention only when it does something unusual, yet its audiences tend to like the same fare as everyone else. Which is to say that ''La BohÃ¨me'' at the 204-seat Dicapo Opera Theater will receive few reviews, but remains a crowd favorite. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 4, Dicapo Opera, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)288-9438, $47.50.(Midgette)    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) Though she missed her scheduled company debut because of illness, Milena Kitic is set to sing the role as planned this weekend. Ruth Ann Swenson is singing her first MicaÃ«las, prettily; Marco Berti is loud but untender as Don JosÃ©; and Philippe Jordan brings a crisp touch as he tries to hold it all together from the pit. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $220. (Midgette)    'LA CENERENTOLA' (Monday, Thursday) Olga Borodina's mezzo-soprano is slightly dark for the title role in Rossini's Cinderella story, but she has the clarity and agility to bring this virtuosic, richly ornamental music to life. The rest of the cast -- including Barry Banks as the Prince, Simone Alberghini as Dandini and Simone Alaimo as Don Magnifico -- is well matched in this comic-book production by Cesare Lievi. Monday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $220. (Allan Kozinn)    'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow, Wednesday) The attention to detail that characterizes this production is truly unusual: it's well cast, well acted and well conducted by a masterly James Levine. It also features the reigning Falstaff of our day, Bryn Terfel, who is matched note for note by the fabulous Stephanie Blythe as Mistress Quickly -- she almost steals the show. Go see it. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $42 to $220. (Midgette)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) Mark Lamos's 1998 production of this Puccini favorite has returned with its crisp geometric elegance intact. Carla Thelen Hanson is a respectable Tosca, and Todd Thomas is a vocally assured, larger-than-life Scarpia. But at the opening performance last week, Jorge Antonio Pita came up short as Cavaradossi, sounding underpowered and intermittently strained. John Demain conducts. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Jeremy Eichler)    Classical Music    PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Thursday) Solo recitals by this exceptional French pianist are not to be missed. Here he plays Pierre Boulez's First Piano Sonata, Ravel's ''Gaspard de la Nuit,'' Schumann's ''Carnaval'' and a handful of Debussy preludes. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $23 to $79. (Eichler)    CECILIA BARTOLI (Wednesday) This great Italian mezzo-soprano promotes her new recording, ''Opera Proibita'' (Decca), with a recital of opera and oratorio arias by Scarlatti, Caldara and Handel. Orchestra La Scintilla of the Zurich Opera supports here, and will have its moment in the sun by way of Caldara and Handel overtures and a Corelli Concerto Grosso. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $37 to $127. (Kozinn)    BEAUX-ARTS TRIO (Tonight) This group, which -- at least in the person of its venerable founding pianist, Menahem Pressler -- has just turned 50, is in its second of three seasons surveying all the piano trios, violin sonatas and cello sonatas of Beethoven. In addition, it gives the American premiere of Jan MÃ¼ller-Wieland's ''Schlaflied,'' or ''Lullaby.'' 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949; $50. (James R. Oestreich)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday, Tuesday) The society once again is mixing and matching its pool of players into ensembles small and large, here a Brahms piano quartet, a Poulenc trio and the Franck duo Sonata in its cello version. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5788, $28 to $49. (Bernard Holland)    CHOIR OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA (Thursday) The choir's director, Kent Tritle, who founded the church's invaluable program Sacred Music in a Sacred Space, conducts a performance of Haydn's glorious and underperformed oratorio ''The Creation.'' 8 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520; $35 and $45; $25 for students and 65+. (Oestreich)    CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA (Monday) Cleveland's conductor, Franz Welser-MÃ¶st, has been getting mixed reviews at home, but the orchestra's last stint in New York showed little reason for alarm and even included some of the loveliest Schubert heard in many moons. Composers of Mr. Welser-MÃ¶st's native Austria seem to draw from him a special affection and fluency, so it's good that he arrives next week bearing Brahms (the First Symphony and the ''Academic Festival Overture'') as well as the New York premiere of a work by Chen Yi. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $33 to $116. (Eichler)    JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Thursday) The premiere of Ezequiel ViÃ±ao's String Quartet No. 2 is the centerpiece of this recital by one of this country's most venerable chamber ensembles. Included as well are Mozart's Quartet in G (K. 387) and Beethoven's Quartet in C sharp minor (Op. 131). 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)    BLAIR McMILLEN and STEPHEN GOSLING (Tomorrow) ''Powerhouse Pianists'' is the title that the sponsoring American Modern Ensemble has given to this joint recital. Few people who have heard these formidable young pianists, champions of contemporary music, would quibble with the billing. Their inventive program includes works by, among others, Lee Hyla, Annie Gosfield, Conlon Nancarrow and David Rakowski. 8 p.m., Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Manhattan, (212)645-2800, $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Tommasini)    CHRISTOPHER MALTMAN (Thursday) A stylish young baritone who has a particular warmth and affinity for song, Mr. Maltman appears with the accompanist Malcolm Martineau in a program of Schumann, Mahler and French song. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $35 to $42.

(Holland)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday, Thursday). Marin Alsop has gotten attention lately for becoming the first woman appointed music director of a major American orchestra, receiving a MacArthur Foundation grant and working on a recorded Brahms symphony cycle. She comes to the Philharmonic with the Brahms First and Midori, who joins her in Prokofiev's first violin concerto. Beginning Thursday, Gianandrea Noseda and the pianist Simon Trpceski take on Rachmaninoff's Third. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $26 to $94. (Midgette)    PAULINE OLIVEROS and IONE (Wednesday) The Mercantile Library, which boasts a second-floor reading room of an ideally intimate size for chamber music, has joined the essential Meet the Composer organization for the concert series ''MTC at the Merc.'' These 60-minute programs also offer a chance to meet the composers and performers. Here the iconoclastic and inventive composer Pauline Oliveros, who also plays the accordion, will be joined by the playwright, poet and author Ione for a performance of ''Cross Overs,'' a musical work that explores, in the phrase of the creators, the sound of words and the making of words out of sound. 6:30 p.m., Mercantile Library, 17 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)755-6710, $15. (Tommasini)    ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Richard Goode's pianism is always thoughtful and deeply felt, so hearing him in two concertos -- Mozart's ''Jeunehomme'' in E flat and Beethoven's Third -- is a rare treat. The program also includes overtures by J.C. Bach and Cherubini. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $30 to $88. (Kozinn)    FREDERIC RZEWSKI (Thursday) In this installment of the Miller Theater's important ''Composer Portraits'' series, the pianists Ursula Oppens and Marilyn Nonken, and the percussionists Tom Kolor and Dominic Donato explore some of Mr. Rzewski's powerful, politically charged works, including his magnificent set of piano variations on ''The People United Will Never Be Defeated.'' Included as well is the New York premiere of ''Bring Them Home,'' an antiwar piece. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799, $20. (Kozinn)    SEQUENTIA (Sunday) Benjamin Bagby's superb group looks into the mists of musical history to a time long before popular and art song parted ways. The program on the ''Music Before 1800'' series is called ''Lost Songs of a Rhineland Harper,'' and examines music of the 10th and 11th centuries. 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212)666-9266, $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+.

On Tuesday the organization presents the gifted Korean-Canadian pianist Wonny Song, winner of the 2003 Prix d'Europe in Quebec. Mr. Song plays works by Beethoven, Ravel and Stephen Paulus, and Mussorgsky's formidable and popular ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $25 and $35. (Tommasini)    TAKACS QUARTET (Tonight) Having recently made its way through all the Beethoven string quartets, this ensemble is in superb shape. It now turns its attention to Debussy's lustrous quartet and two works by Mozart, the ''Dissonance'' Quartet and, with the violist James Dunham as its guest, the G minor Quintet. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $44 to $52.

Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark, (888)466-5722, $20 to $66; tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $27 to $95. (Midgette)    NATALIE ZHU (Tomorrow) This Chinese-born pianist, who can be heard on a new Deutsche Grammophon recording of Mozart violin sonatas with the violinist Hilary Hahn, will also appear with Ms. Hahn in recital next month at Carnegie Hall. But tomorrow night Ms. Zhu, who won an Avery Fisher Career Grant in 2003, has her own chance to shine in a solo recital. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $25; $15 for students and 65+.

(Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'Ãªtre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by FabergÃ©. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Glueck).     *JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and by the way, what is a Jew anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. Refugees from the Holocaust, Jews of color, those of various sexual orientations, an extended Iranian family, a convert to Judaism reared as a Roman Catholic and others are seen and heard in this lively show, which broadens the universe of Jews in this country. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street (212)423-3200. (Glueck)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)     MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13. During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Ken Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was in fact one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. Too, he was a superb colorist, assigning psychological properties to each color, red in particular, which he considered symbolic of power and energy. Among the best works here are his last ones, landscapes that have the magic of Expressionist theater, with houses, trees and the like assuming almost human presences. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676. (Glueck) *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. (See above.)(Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    *ADAM DANT: 'STANDING UNDER' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -THE ART OF DINH Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at age 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    HENRY WOLF Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    *ROBERT BORDO A beautiful, quietistic show by a painter whose work always manages to be both grounded and ethereal, soundless and resonant, abstract and not. Mr. Bordo is at midcareer. The time for a retrospective view is at hand. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212)367-7474, through Oct. 22. (Cotter)    'LANDSCAPE: MYTH AND MEMORY' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212)213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)    NICK MAUSS This fleet, stylish show has a muffled cries-and-whispers sense of mystery. The small paintings and drawings suggest hurried sketches and half-erased images from a suppressed larger narrative. The tites of two paintings, ''Urgent'' and ''Paraphrase,'' sum up the dynamic. Daniel Reich, 537 A West 23rd Street, (212)924-4949, through Oct. 22. (Cotter)    SUE WILLIAMS Few artists have combined figurative abstract painting and existential disgust as variously and effectively as Sue Williams has, and the trajectory continues in this show of new work. Here the battered body parts and de Kooning-esque swipes of the past have been distilled into a tumorous universe of genitals, anuses and noxious emissions, as the biological becomes political. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)255-1121, through Oct. 29. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    CLAIRE FONTAINE Politically charged works by this French artist include a neon-light work that outlines the image of a hooded Iraqi prisoner and child; a neon sign in the gallery's front window that says in Arabic, ''Foreigners Everywhere''; and a tiny sculpture called ''In God We Trust'' in the form of a 25-cent coin with a fold-out box cutter secreted inside. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)477-5006, through Oct. 21. (Johnson)    VIOLA FREY: 'A LASTING LEGACY' This show of the last ceramic sculptures of Viola Frey (1933-2004) is dominated by outsize figures, among them a standing man more than 10 feet tall and a goddesslike seated nude more than 6 feet high, both in white-glazed clay. Although they are untouched by color, a number of slightly earlier works blaze with her usual painterly panache, like the brilliant orange hands and tie, yellow shirt and multicolored face she gave to the large ''Seated Man, Foot Poised on World,'' who seems to kick away a globe in anger or frustration. Nancy Hoffman Gallery, 429 West Broadway, (212)431-3600, through Oct 25. (Glueck)    *ANDRÃ KERTESZ From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)    *MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American Modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212)966-5349, through Oct. 29. (Smith)    Last Chance    *Diane Arbus: 'Other Faces, Other Rooms' If you think you are sufferingfrom Diane Arbus fatigue, this exhibition of 49 photographs that have not been widely published or exhibited will surely refresh your interest. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)366-4774, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    *TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP'  A painter of eclectically layered abstractions has produced a surprising environmental installation: a slightly old-fashioned, fully equipped painter's studio made of brown corrugated cardboard and black paint. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-8304, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)     WOUTER DERUYTTER: 'CROW WARRIORS' You could almost mistake Mr. Deruytter's black-and-white, subtly erotic photographs of Crow Indian warriors in face paint, feathered headdresses and loin cloths, riding bareback horses, for 19th-century ethnographic documents. In fact, they depict contemporary American Indians gathered for an annual re-enactment of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, (212)560-9075, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    *OMER FAST: 'GODVILLE' Video editing is virtuosic medium in Omer Fast's hands, and history a malleable, volatile subject composed of flickering bits and pieces, as seen in this two-channel installation shot in Colonial Williamsburg, a Revolution-era reconstruction where docents dressed in 18th-century clothes, play period roles. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-3323, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    *MONIQUE PRIETO AND LYNDA BENGLIS Ms. Prieto has, in effect, boarded over her abstract paintings with rough-hewn monolithic letters quoting Samuel Pepys's diary. Both the wordiness and the klunkiness are a bit familiar, but extracting Pepys's phrases, which are all deliberately disembodied in reference, can be strangely satisfying. In ''The Graces,'' Ms. Benglis continues to evoke figures by other means, in this case three shimmering stacks of vaselike forms made of heavily textured, lavender-tinted resin. The material is perfect for the process-oriented Ms. Benglis. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-7727, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    'RUSSIA REDUX NO.1' Organized by Elena Sorokina, this show of work by a dozen contemporary artists and artists' collectives from the former Soviet Union is a supplement and critical rejoinder to the celebratory, Putin-power national portrait presented in ''Russia!'' at the Guggenheim Museum. Schroeder Romero, 173A N. Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)486-8992, closing on Monday. . A second exhibition organized by Ms. Sorokina is at Momenta Art, 72 Berry St., Williamsburg, also closing on Monday.

Spanning Woodstock to Watergate, this suburban comedy by Austin Pendleton finds a teenager angry with the members of her family, who are obsessing over her sister's wedding (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. 'EMILIA GALOTTI' Opens Wednesday.

Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100.    'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' Opens Oct. 18. The latest production of this comedy by the unstoppably prolific Alan Ayckbourn is about three couples and takes place over three holiday seasons (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.    'BEOWULF' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Oct. 16. The medieval epic poem becomes a 21st-century rock opera in this Irish Repertory Theater production, with a score by Lenny Pickett, the musical director of ''Saturday Night Live'' (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212)727-2737.    'FIVE COURSE LOVE' Opens Oct. 16. On the menu are five dates in five restaurants, put to music in five different styles, including operetta and country-western (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100.    'IN MY LIFE'  Opens Oct. 20. Love blossoms between a musician with Tourette's syndrome and an insecure journalist in this Broadway musical, directed and written by Joseph Brooks (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.    'JERSEY BOYS' Opens Nov. 6. Straight from La Jolla Playhouse in California, this rags-to-riches musical tells the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, featuring hits including ''Big Girls Don't Cry'' and ''Rag Doll.'' Des McAnuff directs (2:30). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200.    'THE ODD COUPLE' Opens Oct. 27. A little Neil Simon revival you might have heard of, starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick as Oscar and Felix. Joe Mantello directs (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100.    'SEE WHAT I WANT TO SEE' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Oct. 30. Michael John LaChiusa's highly anticipated new musical stars Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch and features three contemporary stories based on the work of the Japanese writer Ryonosuke Akutagawa (2:00). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)239-6200.    'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' Opens Oct. 17. The first major New York revival of Charles Fuller's play about the trial of a black soldier during World War II. With Taye Diggs and James McDaniel (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422.    'SWEENEY TODD' Opens Nov. 3. Patti LuPone and Michael Cerveris star in this intimate revival of the Sondheim classic, featuring 10 actors who play their own instruments. It started at the Watermill Theater in England, before moving to West End and Broadway (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.    'THIRD' Opens Oct. 24. A professor played by Dianne Wiest accuses a student of plagiarism in Wendy Wasserstein's latest. Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200.    Broadway    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'COLDER THAN HERE'  Judith Light plays a British wife and mother slowly succumbing to cancer but resisting low spirits to the last in Laura Wade's skillful but unexceptional play. Brian Murray, Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe cope as best they can, admiring Mom's brave spirit as they heal the rifts that separate them (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-operaish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' In Rolin Jones's fanciful comedy, playfully directed by Jackson Gay, a lonely young woman in California embarks on an ambitious science project to help conquer her agoraphobia and trace her origins in China. Brisk, funny and engaging, the play disappoints only in its emphasis on flights of fancy over a nuanced depiction of its heroine's emotional dilemmas (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR' The Peccadillo Theater Company has revived this 1953 play by Dorothy Parker and Arnaud D'Usseau. A comedy set in an East Side hotel populated by widows and divorcees, it is an unyielding and coruscating portrait of women before feminism, relieved by Parker's dead-on wit. East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Honor Moore)    'LATE FRAGMENT'  Matthew, a World Trade Center employee who survived Sept. 11, and Marta are a desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama named after a Raymond Carver poem. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to diffuse it with less-than-credible moments (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    *'MEDEA' Sure, she gets most of the attention, but let's take a moment to acknowledge Jason, who, as embodied by Lawrence Winslow in the Classical Theater of Harlem's jolting production, contributes some terrific laughs to Euripides' grim tragedy. Yeah, that's right: laughs, the kind you get from the incongruity of the good ol' boys' network encountering Gloria Steinem (1:10). Classical Theater of Harlem, at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MIRACLE BROTHERS' Kirsten Childs's show, about magical Brazilian river dolphins that assume human form to explore racial conflict in the 17th century, does indeed flow like a river -- a winding, muddy, very long river in a dry season (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303. (Brantley)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'NO FOREiGNERS BEYOND THIS POINT'  Two innocents abroad learn the limits of American idealism in Warren Leight's wistfully funny new play about the difficulty of doing good in a society rigged to accommodate only more cynical transactions. Based on Mr. Leight's own experience as a teacher of English in China before he established a career as a playwright (the Tony-winning ''Side Man''), the play is slight but appealing (2:00). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of the show's impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Zinoman)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    'SLUT'  This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Miriam Horn)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York City is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jefferson)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    *'POOR THEATER' Part homage and part anatomy, the Wooster Group's warm, witty tribute to the director Jerzy Grotowski and the choreographer William Forsythe demonstrates how imitation can be not just sincere flattery but also a hopeful attempt to crawl into someone else's skin to see how it fits. As identities and their representations morph and blur, this is not always a comfortable activity, but it is often an exhilarating one (1:30). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212)868-4444. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10).

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'DR. SEX' This harmless, fluffy musical about the life of Alfred Kinsey imagines that groundbreaking scientist and sex researcher as a good-time guy who likes to fool around at gay clubs and crack wise like a Catskills comic. As played by the very game Brian Noonan, Kinsey strips at a moment's notice, dances in front of a Busby Berkeley line of Kinsey Players and boils down his philosophy, quite deftly, actually, into ''When you're making whoop, you're part of a group'' (2:20). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday.( Zinoman)    'FRAN'S BED' Even the ever-radiant charms of Mia Farrow are not enough to dispel the pervasive gloom in this wan new play, written and directed by James Lapine, about an American family facing an unhappy ending. Ms. Farrow plays a comatose woman surveying, in her apparently still-active mind, an unhappy life. Intermittently fun, but mostly glum (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'GEORGE SAUNDERS'S PASTORALIA' An often funny if ultimately disappointing stage adaptation of George Saunders's brilliantly entertaining and brazenly off-kilter novella about an impoverished, historically themed amusement park featuring everything from fake hermits to a simulated Jesus. The director Yehuda Duenyas faithfully adapts this chilling satire, but never figures out a theatrical way to articulate the inner life of its characters (1:25). P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    'MOTHER COURAGE' An effort more commendable for its intention than its execution, this staging fails to capture either the tragedy or the comedy of the play, let alone the ironies of war (2:45). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Wilborn Hampton)    'THE SAFETY NET' Christopher Kyle's thoughtful midlife-crisis drama touches on everything from the racial prejudices of the liberal elite to the nature-nurture debate in this finely tuned production about a man going through the motions. David, an immigration lawyer very close to making partner, has a very late coming of age after his brother dies in a car accident, leaving a pregnant fiancÃ©e (2:00). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, sixth floor, Clinton, (212)397-2918, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    *'SPIRIT' Three men and one slippery slope of a stage. From these simple elements, the inspired London-based Improbable troupe maps a funny, melancholy and altogether entrancing journey into a land of dreams, warfare and actorly neurosis. A magical demonstration that theater can go places that no other art form can. (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'A WOMAN OF WILL' In this wrongheaded solo musical, Kate McNeill (Amanda McBroom) is a lyricist at a creative dead end, in a hotel room waiting for inspiration for a big second-act ballad. In the meantime, she imagines songs in the voices of the heroines of Shakespeare's plays, including a blues tune by Lady Macbeth, a disco number by Kate from ''The Taming of the Shrew'' and a pop anthem by Goneril from ''King Lear'' (''No more Mrs. Nice guy, she's such a dreadful bore./I'm into vivisection, not polishing the floor.'')

(Zinoman)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)    'BEFORE THE FALL' (No rating, 110 minutes, in German) In Hitler's Germany, the National-Political Institutes of Learning, known as ''Napolas,'' were part of a network of elite schools used to train and indoctrinate future leaders with a sadistic combination of boot camp and brainwashing. Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside a Napola to observe the fate of a young amateur boxer and his sensitive roommate. Though somewhat overdetermined, the film is a chilling testament to the seductiveness of groupthink and the allure of imagined superiority. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'CHAIN' (No rating, 99 minutes) Jem Cohen's sad, lyrical evocation of the homogeneity of the global landscape views it through the eyes of two young women: a Japanese corporate functionary researching theme parks in the United States and a glum temp worker eking out a living in shopping malls and motels. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott)    *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le CarrÃ©'s novel. (Scott)    *'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael GonzÃ¡lez (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)    'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)    'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'FORTY SHADES OF BLUE' (No rating, 108 minutes) Ira Sachs's Sundance prizewinner is the sad, lovely story of a Memphis record producer (Rip Torn), his much younger Russian girlfriend (Dina Korzun) and his grown-up son (Darren Burrows), who stumble into a love triangle. Great music and fine acting, with Mr. Torn, at 74, giving the performance of a lifetime. (Scott)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes)two hours, 28 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)    *'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    'GOING SHOPPING' (PG-13, 106 minutes) As loquacious and scatterbrained as its female characters, this Henry Jaglom film explores women's shopping habits and fantasies. Its incomplete sketches revolve around an upscale dress shop on the verge of bankruptcy. (Holden)    'THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED' (PG, 115 minutes) A rousing, obvious re-creation of the 1913 United States Open, in which two sons of the working classes faced off in a game still dominated, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the well-born. Aims for par and makes it. ( Scott)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)    'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)    'LORD OF WAR' (R, 122 minutes) A misfire of a political satire about the international gun market from Andrew Niccol, a filmmaker whose words say no, but whose overworked visual style says lock and load, baby. (Dargis)    'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Anita Gates)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)    *'OCCUPATION: DREAMLAND' (No rating, 79 minutes) In early 2004, eight members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division allowed the directors Ian Olds and Garrett Scott to shadow them for six weeks in a rapidly destabilizing Fallujah. The resulting film is a respectful and determinedly nonpartisan portrait of regular guys -- the smart and the average, the blusterers and the introverts, the gung-ho and the conflicted -- all doing their best to carry out orders in an untenable situation. (Catsoulis)    * 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)    * 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)    'PROOF' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A terribly serious adaptation of David Auburn's prize-laden Broadway play, starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the daughter of a dead mathematician struggling to come to terms with both her father's legacy and her own troubled mind. (Dargis)    'THE RODNEES: WE MOD LIKE DAT!' (No rating, 73 minutes) Striving to be a mockumentary, ''The Rodnees: We Mod Like Dat!'' is a train wreck of a movie: messy, unfunny and unforgivably dull. The plot, such as it is, involves four young African American men from Brooklyn whose failure to succeed in hip-hop prompts them to reinvent themselves as a modern-day version of The Beatles. The film's rare sparks of surreal wit never come close to relieving its general listlessness and lack of organization. (Catsoulis)    'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)    * 'SANTO DOMINGO BLUES' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Spanish) The story of the musical style known as bachata -- a guitar-based blues born in the brothels and dance halls of the Dominican Republic -- and of its most prominent singer and songwriter, Luis Vargas. The film shows the evolution of bachata, long reviled as the music of the poor, to the mainstream with the mass immigration of Dominicans to the United States in the 1980's. A lively, sexy, insightful documentary.(Catsoulis)    'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)    'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'THUMBSUCKER' (R, 96 minutes) A better-than-usual coming-of-age story, via Sundance but without the usual sensationalism or condescension, and with some very fine performances, notably by Lou Pucci as a teenage boy with a childish habit. (Scott)    'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)    * 'TOUCH THE SOUND' (No rating, 99 minutes) As Thomas Riedelsheimer's enlightening, mystical documentary follows the deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie around the globe, it illustrates her understanding that sound is a physical sensation experienced throughout the body, as well as an auditory one. (Holden)    'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly virus. (Laura Kern)    * '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'AN UNFINISHED LIFE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) This contemporary Western starring Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman is a solemn, sentimental bore that suffocates in its own predictability and watered-down psychobabble. All three stars recycle stereotypes they've played before. (Holden)    * 'WALLACE AND GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher.

(Sinagra)    GHOSTFACE (Sunday) The Wu-Tang Clan's jittery, wildly inventive Ghostface Killah raps with both short-fused intensity and narrative nuance; his hyperventilated flow is full of digressions that reward close listening.

(Sinagra)    MARIZA (Tonight) Mariza, who was born in Mozambique but grew up in Portugal, is one of the rising stars of fado, the Portuguese cafe music that sets haunted songs about fate and destiny to the pristine picking of the Portuguese guitar. She wrings emotion from the songs, with or without amplification. 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $20 to $69. (Pareles)    MESHUGGAH, GOD FORBID, THE HAUNTED (Tonight) The Swedish band Meshuggah barrels through songs characterized by intricate rhythms and apocalyptic rumble, over which the members spew angry, guttural, prelingual vocals. The like-minded God Forbid and the Haunted open. 6 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE (Thursday) The popular My Chemical Romance plays goth pop with metallic guitars and histrionic riffs that aim to engage every football player's inner theater-geek. Alkaline Trio's drummer and bandleader, Mike Skiba, continues to add 80's brood-pop wrinkles to his straightforward pop punk. 7 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900; $17.99 to $23. (Sinagra)    NADA SURF, SHIVAREE (Tonight) These Brooklyn alt-rockers tumbled into obscurity after a mid-90's hit, then re-emerged in 2002 with a sweet new style: wistful indie rock that squints nostalgically at imagined childhood bliss through a snowy pane. Shivaree plays loungey pop with archness. 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN (Tuesday) This clear-voiced Australian songbird's got lots of hits from her dreamy faux-country phase in the early 70's (''Have You Never Been Mellow''), her faux-ingÃ©nue turn in ''Grease'' and her aerobic ''Physical'' era, but Ms. Newton-John's battles with cancer and other struggles ushered in a 90's round of un-faux new-age questing. Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $44.50 to 59.50. (Sinagra)    THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS, DESTROYER (Wednesday and Thursday) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until the voice of Neko Case cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. Ms. Case has not appeared at the band's recent shows in town, but she'll be here this time. New Pornographer co-songwriter Dan Bejar's band, the relentlessly quirky Destroyer, opens the show. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    NICKEL CREEK (Tonight) This emo-bluegrass trio, which once covered a Pavement song, is at its best when the thin-voiced Chris Thile hands over the microphone to the fiddler and ethereal singer Sara Watkins. That is, it's better to sound like a wispier Allison Krauss than a simplistic Sufjan Stevens. 8, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171, $24. (Sinagra)    THE RAVEONETTES, RADIO 4 (Tonight) Clearing away the garage noise of its debut, the Danish duo the Raveonettes now strives for pure 60's pop classicism. Its latest material incorporates rock history, from girl groups to surf rock to punk, as well as historic rock in the form of cameos by Ronnie Spector, the Suicide keyboardist Martin Rev and the Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker. The local neo post-punkers Radio 4 open. 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505; $16. (Sinagra)    IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Tomorrow) This St. Paul, Minn., rocker's visceral, outlandishly catchy tunes capture a certain kind of cockiness and bar clown wit that almost make the listener overlook its macho nudges and winks. Mr. Reilly and his band tear it up live. Shadow Box and Catfish Haven will open. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    JONATHAN RICHMAN, VIC CHESNUTT (Wednesday) Recent albums haven't added much to the whimsically neurotic rock 'n' roll live wire Jonathan Richman's stream-of-consciousness classics, but live, he remains a goofy joy. Recent material by the Southern Gothic storyteller Vic Chesnutt leans to his darker side. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)    SIX ORGANS OF ADMITTANCE (Tonight) The guitarist Ben Chasny plays exploratory noise-rock that draws on rootsy weirdness and a kind of chime and drone that suggest a global search for transcendence. 11:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    SONS AND DAUGHTERS (Tomorrow) These gloomy Scots play folk-rock with edgy pessimism that reminds us, as if we could forget, that life in the gray North isn't all delicate, Belle and Sebastian-style reverie. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $12. (Sinagra)    BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (Sunday) The Boss made ''The Rising'' after the twin towers fell, beating the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer to the notion of reverse-collapse by four years. Mr. Springsteen's spare ''Devils and Dust'' (Sony) charts the way back down, meditating with other soul-searchers at the crossroads of humanism and religion. 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000; $56.50 to $86.50. (Sinagra)    STEW (Monday) This Los Angeles pop craftsman writes songs that slip just enough bitters into the 70's lite rock cocktail to make it subversive. His faux-big production on disc isn't required live, because his songs are cabaret to the core. And aside from chuckling at his own asides, he is a consummate performer. This show is evidently of a piece with performances on the following two Tuesdays. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $20 per show, $50 for all three shows only at Joe's Pub's box office. (Sinagra)    SUFJAN STEVENS (Tonight) This indie folk singer-songwriter and banjoist is imbued with a Copland-esque musical vision and an expansive narcissism reminiscent of Walt Whitman's, though his lyrics can overreach and his compositions veer into the folksily baroque. 8:30 and 10:30, Peter Norton Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400; $21. (sold out) (Sinagra)    TURBONEGRO (Tuesday) Making its mark in the late 90's by posing as a flamboyantly gay metal band, the hard-rocking Norwegians of Turbonegro have worn out their shtick. They still bring the riffs, but a recent song, ''All My Friends Are Dead,'' might sum up their ideas as they drift into self-parody. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)    U2, KEANE (Tonight, and tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday nights) After 2000's thrilling ''All That You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope) and the ''Vertigo'' tour itself focus on what humans can live without: namely, intercontinental ballistic missiles and, evidently, some of U2's more shopworn live staples. Hence the resurrection of decades-old rarities like ''Electric Co.'' Keane is a piano-drums-vocals band that piles on hooky melodic flourishes. 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $54 to $169.50. (Sinagra)    WACO BROTHERS BLOODSHOT REVUE (Wednesday) Jon Langford of the Mekons indulges his country side even more strongly in the Waco Brothers, where he trades off lead vocals with Dean Schlabowske and ricochets between revolution and beer-soaked self-pity while letting his electric guitar blare. The Mekons' Sally Timms joins the bill. 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703; $12. (Pareles)    WARLOCKS (Thursday) With a deep affection for 60's downtown drug rock, especially the Velvet Underground, this band creates a heavy vibe while also making forays into free-form psychedelia. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15.

(Chinen)    *ROY HAYNES FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH BAND (Wednesday through Oct. 16) The redoubtable drummer Roy Haynes turned 80 this year, although you'd never guess it by his playing; his edgy post-bop ensemble features musicians many years his junior, like the alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212)582-2121; cover, $30 and $35, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'ARIADNE AUF NAXOS' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Admirers of Deborah Voigt may be disappointed that she is not singing her signature role in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' but the strong Lithuanian mezzo-turned-soprano Violeta Urmana does not disappoint. And the cast, overall, is exceptional, especially the brilliant coloratura soprano Diana Damrau as Zerbinetta, and the radiant mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the Composer. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini)    'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEUE' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Even before the new production opens, the New York City Opera deserves thanks from opera buffs for presenting this rarity by Paul Dukas, best known as the composer of ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Dukas's delightful opera tells the story of Bluebeard from a woman's point of view. Renate Behle, in her company debut, sings Ariane. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $110. (Tommasini)    'LA BOHÃME' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Pity a small opera company: it only gets critical attention when it does something unusual, yet its audiences tend to like the same fare as everyone else. Which is to say that ''La BohÃ¨me'' at the 204-seat Dicapo Opera will get few reviews, but remains a company standby and a crowd favorite. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)288-9438; $47.50. (Anne Midgette)    'LA CENERENTOLA' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Very few voice connoisseurs question the amazing gifts of the molten-voiced, temperamental Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina. But the intense Ms. Borodina as a comic Rossini heroine? That may sound like a stretch. Actually, Ms. Borodina showed wonderful comic instincts in Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' a couple seasons back, and her coloratura technique was impressive. So expect good things when she takes on Rossini's ''Cenerentola'' in a revival of Cesare Lievi's imaginative production. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $220. (Tommasini)    'FALSTAFF' (Wednesday) The attention to detail that characterizes this production is truly unusual: it's well cast, well acted and well conducted by a masterly James Levine. It also features the reigning Falstaff of our day, Bryn Terfel, who is matched note for note by the fabulous Stephanie Blythe as Mistress Quickly -- she almost steals the show. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. $26 to $175. (Midgette)    'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's classic is one of New York City Opera's best. And there's a lot else to like here, from the intermittently good conducting of Ari Pelto to Jake Gardner's Sharpless. Shu-Ying Li, who was magnificent in the title role when the Dicapo Opera presented all three versions of the opera last year, has taken it over here, evidently with considerable success. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $110. (Midgette)    'MANON' (Tonight) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's production of this Massenet tragedy, absent from the Metropolitan Opera since 2001, returns with RenÃ©e Fleming as the conflicted Manon, and Marcelo Ãlvarez as a passionate and unusually well-rounded des Grieux. Both are in fine voice, and have the support of a well-balanced cast, as well as vibrant conducting by JÃ©sus LÃ³pez-Cobos. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $36 to $205. (Allan Kozinn)    'TOSCA' (Sunday and Thursday) Franco Zeffirelli's production of ''Tosca'' at the Metropolitan Opera may offer sumptuous and gargantuan realism, but Mark Lamos's striking production at the New York City Opera offers spare and contemporary theatricality. It returns to the repertory with the soprano Carla Thelen Hanson in her company debut as Tosca, and John DeMain conducting. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $110. (Tommasini)    Classical Music    BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) You can almost see the fun James Levine is having, planning orchestral seasons, and this well-stuffed program is a prime example of a fertile imagination at play: Elliott Carter's ''Three Illusions,'' in its New York premiere; Lukas Foss's masterwork ''Time Cycle,'' with Dawn Upshaw as vocalist; Ives's ''Three Places in New England''; and Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F, with Jean-Yves Thibaudet. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $30 to $105. (James R. Oestreich)    COMPOSER PORTRAITS (Tonight) George Antheil is the subject of the current installment of this important and enlightening series. Daniel Spalding will conduct the Philadelphia Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra, and Guy Livingston will be the soloist in the Piano Concerto No.2, the centerpiece of a program that also includes the Serenade No.2 and ''Dreams Ballet.'' 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799; $20. (Kozinn)    GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow). You have to admire the group's stick-to-itiveness, if not always its freshness and polish. Maybe the young violist Scott St. John will inject new energy into Mozart's Quintet in C (K. 515). 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949; $50. (Oestreich)    JUILLIARD SYMPHONY (Tuesday) The country's most famous conservatory is celebrating its centenary, and part of its celebration is this performance by the student orchestra, which has proved a superb group in past encounters. The program includes works by Webern, Rautavaara and Schubert, with Dennis Russell Davies conducting. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $10 to $25. (Kozinn)    JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) The pianist Ilya Itin and the violinist Dmitri Berlinsky are the guests of this feisty ensemble, which in the spirit of its founder, Jens Nygaard, offers programs that combine oddities and major works. This time the fare includes Josef Myslivecek's Trio in G, Dvorak's Octet-Serenade (an arrangement of the Serenade for Strings, Op. 22) and the Brahms Trio in B. At 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212)799-1259; $10 to $25. (Kozinn)    'THE VIRGIL FOX LEGACY' (Tonight through Monday) With a variety of organists on hand, these performances and discussions at various churches in Manhattan honor the memory of the ultimate switched-on master of the instrument on the 25th anniversary of his death. Don't expect the obsequies to be subdued. Most tickets: $25. Information: (212)799-9300, (800)486-6628 or www.legacyconcerts.com. (Oestreich)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    MARIA ELENA ANAYA DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Ms. Anaya's ''Caracolas de un Mar de Fuego'' includes traditional flamenco and dance inspired by a poem by the 17th-century Mexican poet Sor Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz. 7:30 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710 or lamama.org; $20. (Jennifer Dunning)    BALLET AUSTIN (Tonight through Sunday) The company makes its New York City debut with a program of award-winning dances choreographed by its artistic director, Stephen Mills. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800; $38. (Erika Kinetz)    DANCEOFF! (Tuesday and Wednesday) Ten modern-dance choreographers and companies, some famous and others not, have been chosen by Terry Dean Bartlett and Katie Workum for this showcase series. 8 and 10 p.m., P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101 or ps122.org; $20. (Dunning)    DANCE THEATER ETC (Tomorrow) Thirty dancers dressed as angels will interact with 19th-century statuary in a free, combination two-hour performance and walking tour. Noon and 3 p.m. (Rain date, Sunday), Green-Wood Cemetery, 25th Street and Fifth Avenue, Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn, (718)788-7850 or dancetheatreetcetera.org (Dunning)    EQUUS PROJECTS (Tomorrow and Sunday) JoAnna Mendl Shaw, who likes to pair dancers with horses and riders, choreographically gallops into a riding academy with ''Rules of Engagement,'' a collaboration with Janet Biggs, an artist and video creator, and Steve White, a composer. It is a multidisciplinary production involving dancing, a horse and rider and site-specific videos. 8 p.m., Claremont Riding Academy, 175 West 89th Street, Manhattan, (800)595-4849 or dancingwithhorses.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the door; students and ages 65+, $20 in advance; $25 at the door). (Jack Anderson)    JORDAN FUCHS (Tonight through Sunday night) In ''The Almost and the Nearly,'' unusual seating arrangements intentionally limit the performance space, and the choreography tries to blur distinctions between presence and absence as dancers are drawn together and apart. 8:30; Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194 or danspaceproject.org; $15. (Anderson)    GINA GIBNEY DANCE (Thursday) A seasoned, subtle modern-dance choreographer who gives equal opportunity to her brain and heart, Ms. Gibney will present a new multimedia work, ''unbounded,'' that explores the tensions between clinging to the known and reaching for the unknowable. 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194; $15 or T.D.F. (Dunning)    YOKO HIGASHINO AND HIROAKI UMEDA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Two young Japanese dancers create their own surreal worlds. In ''Alarm! -- zero hour edition,'' Ms. Higashino suggests the unpredictability of a society under the siege of change. Strips of light keep appearing and vanishing, guiding and abandoning Mr. Umeda in ''while going to a condition.'' 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or dtw.org; $20; students and 65+, $12. (Anderson)    BEBE MILLER COMPANY (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Miller, in her company's 20th anniversary, is the latest dance artist to take advantage of the impressive technological facilities at Dance Theater Workshop. In her new ''Landing/Place,'' Ms. Miller will integrate digital motion-capture technology, animation and video projections into a dance about traveling in Eritrea. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077; $25. (Dunning)    CHARLES MOORE DANCE THEATER (Tonight) A company featuring dances of Africa and the Caribbean performed with historical respect and contemporary elation offers its new ''Strength of the Spirit.'' 8, Peter Norton Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400 or symphonyspace.org; $25; children, students and ages 65+, $20.(Anderson)    PATRICIA NICHOLSON: 'DANCE WORDS SPEAK PEACE' (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Nicholson believes in the power of socially conscious art to nurture weary souls. The program also includes choreography by KJ Holmes. 7:30, Clemente Soto VÃ©lez, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212)696-6681 or visionfestival.org; $12. (Dunning)    NEXT WAVE FESTIVAL: NATIONAL BALLET OF CHINA (Tuesday through Thursday) The company will perform ''Raise the Red Lantern,'' which tells the story of a young concubine in 1920's China with a fusion of ballet, modern dance and traditional Chinese dance, set to music performed on Western and Chinese instruments and directed by Zhang Yimou, the noted film director. 7:30 p.m., BAM Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100; $20 to $70. (Dunning)    ODC/SAN FRANCISCO (Tuesday through Thursday) This program by two of this San Francisco-based company's resident choreographers includes dances by Brenda Way, among them one inspired by global warming, and by KT Nelson. 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or joyce.org; $38. (Dunning)    REVERB FESTIVAL (Tonight and tomorrow night) A new organization that seeks to brings together works derived from different cultural backgrounds and aesthetic perspectives offers its first programs. The participating choreographers are Ayako Kurakake, Ofelia Loret de Mola, Kate Hutter, Lane Gifford, Nelly van Bommel and Sidra Bell. 8, Joan Weill Center for Dance, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)280-3468 or (914)630-4505; $15; students, $12. (Anderson)    HENNING RUBSAM'S SENSEDANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Rubsam tends to mix ballet, modern dance and a kind of sunny optimism in dances that often probe the special qualities in his performers. This program includes choreography set to music by Beata Moon, Beethoven, Brahms, Django Reinhardt and Ricardo Llorca, with the guest artists Melissa Morrissey and Ramon Thielen from Dance Theater of Harlem. 8 p.m., Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (646)312-4085; $22 and $30. (Dunning)    MALLIKA SARABHAI AND THE DARPANA PERFORMING GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) In the edible-sounding ''Hot Talas Cool Rasas,'' the artists promise a bouquet of styles and ideas that form the panorama of contemporary dance in India. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Ailey Studios Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)529 2347. Wednesday, $150; Thursday, $35 and students and 65+, $20. (Dunning)    2005 D.U.M.B.O. DANCE FESTIVAL (Thursday) Last year's festival was a lot of fun, with companies and individuals who looked as if they had been chosen with a sense of personal taste, perhaps that of the festival director, Young Soon Kim, and dance in a huge variety of styles spilling out across a small, shining studio-theater. And it's all free. 7 p.m., White Wave's John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street, on the waterfront, Brooklyn, (718)855-8822 or whitewavedance.com. (Dunning)    KRIOTA WILLBERG/DURA MATER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Willberg has a wicked eye for the foibles of American dance, and she lets it rove, deliciously, in ''The Bentfootes,'' a beautifully costumed multimedia satire that tells the story of 200 years of dance by the fictitious Susan Bentfoote and her family of unerringly mediocre artists. 8, Dixon Place at University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, (212)219-0736 or dixonplace.org; $10 to $15. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic ''outsider'' category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'Ãªtre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by FabergÃ©. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia itself, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his own work artifacts that he has collected over the years, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossil stones to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the trylon and perisphere (a mini-sculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Glueck).    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    *ADAM DANT: 'STANDING UNDER' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    HENRY WOLF Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the extraordinarily suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's own noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    'SALUTE TO THE 130TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ART STUDENTS LEAGUE' No gallery in the city regularly offers better small group exhibitions of American modernism than Washburn. And its homage to the Art Students League made up of work by four illustrious students -- Louise Nevelson, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and David Smith -- is a sterling example. The Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, 8th floor, (212)397-6780, through Oct. 29. (Cotter)    Galleries: Chelsea    DENNIS ADAMS: 'MAKE DOWN' This brainy political artist presents a video in which he uses film stills from the movie ''Battle of Algiers'' to wipe dark green makeup off his face and body. It's about terrorism, gender, masking and unmasking. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212)627-3680, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)    *DIANE ARBUS: 'OTHER FACES OTHER ROOMS' If think you are suffering from Diane Arbus fatigue, this exhibition of 49 photographs that have not been widely published or exhibited will surely refresh your interest. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212)366-4774, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    *TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP'  A painter of eclectically layered abstractions has produced a surprising environmental installation: a slightly old-fashioned, fully equipped painter's studio made of brown corrugated cardboard and black paint. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, (212)727-8304, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    WOUTER DERUYTTER: 'CROW WARRIORS' You could almost mistake Mr. Deruytter's black-and-white, subtly erotic photographs of Crow Indian warriors in face paint, feathered headdresses and loin cloths, riding bareback horses, for 19th-century ethnographic documents. In fact, they depict contemporary Indians gathered for an annual re-enactment of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, (212)560-9075, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    TOM HUCK: 'THE BLOODY BUCKET SERIES' Extra-large black-and-white woodcuts by this Missourian look like the works of a Northern Renaissance artist who time-traveled to 1960's California and became an underground comic book artist. His jam-packed compositions are gleefully obscene and violent without being too offensive, and the prints are technically impressive. David Krut, 526 West 26th Street, (212)255-3094, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    'MUD' This exceptional four-artist show of small sculpture features lively, insouciant ceramics by the painter Joanne Greenbaum; crusty, off-white ceramics by Elliott Levine that look like ancient artifacts; cartoonish sculptures about modern machines by Aga Ousseinov; and rough, semiabstract sculptures in Styrofoam and papier mÃ¢chÃ©, alluding to landscapes and furniture, by Yuh-Shioh Wong. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212)947-2818, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    *MONIQUE PRIETO AND LYNDA BENGLIS Ms. Prieto has, in effect, boarded over her abstract paintings with rough-hewn monolithic letters quoting Samuel Pepys's famous diary. Both the wordiness and the klunkiness are a bit familiar, but extracting Pepys's phrases, which are all deliberately disembodied in reference, can be strangely satisfying. In ''The Graces,'' Ms. Benglis continues to evoke figures by other means, in this case three shimmering stacks of vaselike forms made of heavily textured, lavender-tinted resin. The material is perfect for the process-oriented Ms. Benglis. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Oct. 15. (Smith)    Other Galleries    IAN BURNS Mr. Burns's amusing whirligigs, small motorized contraptions and a large sit-in piece that directs your gaze to a series of illuminated screens like shadow-puppet theaters are roughly made of wood, with outsiderlike ingenuity. His cheerfully satiric cartoon imagery addresses terrorism and the war in Iraq. Spencer Brownstone, 39 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)334-3455, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    Claire Fontaine Politically charged works by this French artist include a neon-light work that outlines the image of a hooded Iraqi prisoner and child; a neon sign in the gallery's front window that says in Arabic, ''Foreigners Everywhere''; and a tiny sculpture called ''In God We Trust'' in the form of a 25-cent coin with a fold-out box cutter secreted inside. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)477-5006, through Oct. 21. (Johnson)    *MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212)966-5349, through Oct. 29. (Smith).    'PAPER MUSEUMS: THE REPRODUCTIVE PRINT IN EUROPE, 1500-1800' From the early 16th century to the beginning of the 19th, prints that reproduced the original work of artists were the only means of acquainting a broad public with the creative endeavors of DÃ¼rer, Raphael, Rubens, Michelangelo and the like. This show displays the variety and vitality of such reproductive prints, and points up how they effectively circulated artists' works and ideas in Europe. Don't expect lots of pictorial splash here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212)998-6780, through Dec. 3. (Glueck)    Last Chance    *PHILIP-LORCA diCORCIA: 'LUCKY THIRTEEN' Strippers are hardly a new subject for fine-art photographers, but Mr. diCorcia's monumental portraits of pole dancers are far from routine. Each of the 13 glossy pictures depicts a scantily dressed -- in one case, nude -- female dancer practicing her art in a dark and empty club. All but one assume upside-down positions, as if posing for a Renaissance painter of angels and crucifixions, and the effect is more of spiritual and athletic austerity than of cheesy eroticism. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212)929-7000, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    *KIM JONES: 'WAR PAINT' Kim Jones has been best known since the late 1970's for his appearances on the streets, in subways and in galleries as the walking sculpture called Mudman. This show is made up of wearable shirts and jackets with boxy, three-dimensional ink-and-acrylic paintings attached to the back, each painting a cross between a computer game and a battle plan. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-2144, closing on Monday. (Cotter)    *MARTIN McMURRAY: 'BLOODSHOT AND GLOWING' In a solo debut, small, fraught figurative paintings evoke some of the tragedies of American history and literature, and transcend a host of artistic influences with a flinty intensity. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-0156, closing tomorrow. (Smith).    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÃLION  HÃ©lion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or weaknesses, but is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    *'Pop Politics Power' In this measured but intense three-artist show, Martha Rosler offers a continuation of her 1967-72 photomontage series ''Bringing the War Home''; Carolee Schneemann is represented by both a new film and by her mesmerizing 1965 ''Viet Flakes,'' in which a rush of grainy black-and-white war photographs looks like smoke billowing from a volcano; and Robert Boyd introduces two spooky videos about doomsday religious cults, past, present and (probably) future. LMAKprojects, 526 West 26th Street, No.310, Chelsea, (212)255-9707, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    Raqib Shaw: 'Garden of Earthly Delights' Labor-intensive and intensely active, Raqib Shaw's paintings look like X-rated, subaquatic hybrids of Hieronymous Bosch, Victorian fairy painting, Persian miniatures and Bollywood films of the Ramayana. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)343-7300, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    *JANET SOBEL This self-taught, late-blooming artist introduced Jackson Pollock to his signature drip technique, playing Henri Rousseau to his Picasso. Here, her art veers between the semi-abstract works that Pollock saw in 1944 and folk-artish, happy-peasant landscapes (inspired by a Ukrainian childhood) in which inventively handled paint does most of the dancing. This stunning show reveals a wily, liberated artist whose closest European analogy may be Jean Dubuffet. DC Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212)247-1111, closing tomorrow. (Smith).    WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING' The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600, closing Sunday. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'PAST PRESENCE: CHILDHOOD AND MEMORY' This modestly resonant show of works relating to juvenile experience presents a glass cabinet filled with 2,000 miniature white ceramic vessels by Charles LeDray; small, finely drawn, photo-based pictures of children by Peggy Preheim; and a politically suggestive chalkboard drawing by Gary Simmons. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453, closing on Thursday.

Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200.    Broadway    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'COLDER THAN HERE' Judith Light plays a British wife and mother slowly succumbing to cancer but resisting low spirits to the last in Laura Wade's skillful but unexceptional play. Brian Murray, Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe cope as best they can, admiring Mom's brave spirit as they heal the rifts that separate them (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DR. SEX' This harmless, fluffy musical about the life of Alfred Kinsey imagines the groundbreaking scientist and sex researcher as a good-time guy who likes to fool around at gay clubs and crack wise like a Catskills comic. As played by the very game Brian Noonan, Kinsey strips at a moment's notice, dances in front of a Busby Berkeley line of Kinsey Players and boils down his philosophy, quite deftly, actually, into ''When you're making whoop, you're part of a group'' (2:20). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FRAN'S BED' Even the ever-radiant charms of Mia Farrow are not enough to dispel the pervasive gloom in this wan new play, written and directed by James Lapine, about an American family facing an unhappy ending. Ms. Farrow plays a comatose woman surveying, in her apparently still-active mind, an unhappy life. Intermittently fun, but mostly glum (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' In Rolin Jones's fanciful comedy, playfully directed by Jackson Gay, a lonely young woman in California embarks on an ambitious science project to help conquer her agoraphobia and trace her origins in China. Brisk, funny and engaging, the play disappoints only in its emphasis on flights of fancy over a nuanced depiction of its heroine's emotional dilemmas (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR' The Peccadillo Theater Company has revived this 1953 play by Dorothy Parker and Arnaud D'Usseau. A comedy set in an East Side hotel populated by widows and divorcees, it is an unyielding and coruscating portrait of women before feminism, relieved by Parker's dead-on wit. East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Honor Moore)    *'MEDEA' Sure, she gets most of the attention, but let's take a moment to acknowledge Jason, who, as embodied by Lawrence Winslow in the Classical Theater of Harlem's jolting production, contributes some terrific laughs to Euripides' grim tragedy. Yeah, that's right: laughs, the kind you get from the incongruity of the good ol' boys' network encountering Gloria Steinem (1:10). Classical Theater of Harlem, at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MOTHER COURAGE' An effort more commendable for its intention than its execution, this staging fails to capture either the tragedy or the comedy of the play, let alone the ironies of war (2:45). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton)    'NO FOREiGNERS BEYOND THIS POINT' Two innocents abroad learn the limits of American idealism in Warren Leight's wistfully funny new play about the difficulty of doing good in a society rigged to accommodate only more cynical transactions. Based on Mr. Leight's own experience as a teacher of English in China before he established a career as a playwright (the Tony-winning ''Side Man''), the play is slight but appealing (2:00). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Zinoman)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Jennifer Mudge, as the girl he abandoned, is poignantly hopeless. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    *'SPIRIT' Three men and one slippery slope of a stage. From these simple elements, the inspired London-based Improbable troupe maps a funny, melancholy and altogether entrancing journey into a land of dreams, warfare and actorly neurosis. A magical demonstration that theater can go places that no other art form can. (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalogue, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'GEORGE SAUNDERS'S PASTORALIA' An often funny if ultimately disappointing stage adaptation of George Saunders's brilliantly entertaining and brazenly off-kilter novella about a financially strapped, historically themed amusement park featuring everything from fake hermits to a simulated Jesus. The director Yehuda Duenyas faithfully adapts the chilling satire, but never figures out a theatrical way to articulate the inner life of its characters(1:25). P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. (Zinoman)    *'POOR THEATER' Part homage and part anatomy, the Wooster Group's warm, witty tribute to the director Jerzy Grotowski and the choreographer William Forsythe demonstrates how imitation can be not just sincere flattery but also a hopeful attempt to crawl into someone else's skin to see how it fits. As identities and their representations morph and blur, this is not always a comfortable activity, but it is often an exhilarating one (1:30). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212)868-4444. (Brantley)    'THE SAFETY NET' Christopher Kyle's thoughtful midlife-crisis drama touches on everything from the racial prejudices of the liberal elite to the nature-nurture debate in this finely tuned production about a man going through the motions. David, an immigration lawyer very close to making partner, has a very late coming of age after his brother dies in a car accident, leaving a pregnant fiancÃ©e (2:00). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, sixth floor, Clinton, (212)397-2918. (Jason Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10).

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    * 'COUCHWORKS' On a set featuring a beat-up couch, this lively collection of one-acts by playwrights like Adam Rapp and Theresa Rebeck has the feel of a party thrown by the cool kids of downtown theater. By far the most fully realized play is ''Music for a High Ceiling,'' in which a potentially dry subject -- the history of the theremin and the trumpet -- is staged with panache (1:30). The Tank at Chashama, 208 West 37th Street, (212)868-4444, closing Tuesday.(Zinoman)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101, closing tonight. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Manohla Dargis)    'CHAIN' (No rating, 99 minutes) Jem Cohen's sad, lyrical evocation of the homogeneity of the global landscape views it through the eyes of two young women: a Japanese corporate functionary researching theme parks in the United States and a glum temp worker eking out a living in shopping malls and motels. (Stephen Holden)    *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le CarrÃ©'s novel. (Scott)    *'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael GonzÃ¡lez (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)    'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)    'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Dargis)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)    'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)    *'KEANE' (R, 93 minutes) A man goes searching for his lost daughter -- or does he? The irony of this very fine film is that while the director Lodge Kerrigan's approach can verge on the entomological, he grants this troubled, difficult character the full measure of his humanity. (Dargis)    'LORD OF WAR' (R, 122 minutes) A misfire of a political satire about the international gun market from Andrew Niccol, a filmmaker whose words say no, but whose overworked visual style says lock and load, baby. (Dargis)    'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Anita Gates)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    *'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)    *'OCCUPATION: DREAMLAND' (No rating, 79 minutes) In early 2004, eight members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division allowed the directors Ian Olds and Garrett Scott to shadow them for six weeks in a rapidly destabilizing Fallujah. The resulting film is a respectful and determinedly nonpartisan portrait of regular guys -- the smart and the average, the blusterers and the introverts, the gung-ho and the conflicted -- all doing their best to carry out orders in an untenable situation. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)    'PROOF' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A terribly serious adaptation of David Auburn's prize-laden Broadway play, starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the daughter of a dead mathematician struggling to come to terms with both her father's legacy and her own troubled mind. (Dargis)    * 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)    'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)    'THUMBSUCKER' (R, 96 minutes) A better-than-usual coming-of-age story, via Sundance but without the usual sensationalism or condescension, and with some very fine performances, notably by Lou Pucci as a teenage boy with a childish habit. (Scott)    'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)    'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this purely shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a young boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus. (Laura Kern)    * '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'AN UNFINISHED LIFE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) This contemporary Western starring Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman is a solemn, sentimental bore that suffocates in its own predictability and watered-down psychobabble. All three stars recycle stereotypes they've played before. (Holden)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    FILM SERIES    AFTER WAR (Through Oct. 23) The Japan Society is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II with this series of works about wartime and its aftermath. ''Under the Flag of the Rising Sun'' (1972), about a sergeant executed for desertion, is to be shown tomorrow.

Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212)879-9779; $8. (Gates)    FRANÃOIS TRUFFAUT (Through Nov. 27). The IFC Center's Weekend Classics program is presenting a dozen Truffaut features and two shorts.

DOG (Monday) With its hip choral flourishes, kicky grooves and pep-rally shouts, the quirky collective Architecture in Helsinki makes happy baroque pop. The shaggy Philly lo-fi rockers Dr. Dog open. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505; $12.50.(Sinagra)    BECK (Thursday) Back to retro-ironic rock form after a while spent making sincere anti-folk music, the self-aware soulman Beck Hanson aims to reclaim his mid-90's role as pop's forward- and backward-looking prince of pastiche. 7 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-7740; $42. (Sinagra)    BRASS BAND BENEFIT FOR NEW ORLEANS (Sunday) A group of brass bands, including McCollough Sons of Thunder, the Hungry March Band, Jambalaya Brass Band, Slavic Soul Party!, Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band and Frank London's Klezmer Brass Allstars, convene for this Hurricane Katrina benefit show, with a theme of music from New Orleans, the birthplace of the form. 7 p.m., Jan Hus Church, 351 East 74th Street, Manhattan, (212)288-6743; $15. (Sinagra)    JOHN BUTLER TRIO (Tonight) John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. 7:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    CAPLETON (Monday) With his machine-gun flow, the dancehall veteran Capleton denounces the hell of corruption he finds all around him. He also has softer romantic and spiritual sides, but it's tough to imagine him letting his guard down. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    GEORGE CLINTON & PARLIAMENT/FUNKADELIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. The band is large enough to be a party all on its own, with ranks of guitarists, singers, horn players and keyboardists to pump out songs that encompass decades of American musical history. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 8, , Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)531-5305;$40 to $50. (Pareles)    THE DECEMBERISTS (Tuesday) Colin Melloy's songs about child queens, heartsick spies and vengeful seafarers duking it out inside a whale hold up well alongside his love songs, so formally sturdy that even when bittersweet they seem to have hope mixed into their mortar. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $23 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    EAST VILLAGE OPERA COMPANY (Wednesday and Thursday) The Canadians Peter Kiesewalter and Tyley Ross blend opera and rock to form something that is decidedly not rock opera. The band includes a string section and performs classical arias like ''La donna Ã© mobile'' and ''Ave Maria,'' adding electronic percussion, guitar solos and flamboyant 80's keyboard antics. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)    ELECTRIC SIX, MORNINGWOOD (Tonight) Detroit's Electric Six plays manic garage rock that surges with disco-punk. Dick Valentine can howl with the best of them, but it remains to be seen whether lineup changes will affect the high energy level. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)    ROBERT FRIPP, PORCUPINE TREE (Tomorrow) Mr. Fripp, the King Crimson guitarist, is the inventor of the spacey, droning combination of tape loops called ''Frippertronics.'' Porcupine Tree's melodic psychedelic prog rock has a metallic edge. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100; $32.50 (Sinagra)    BEBEL GILBERTO (Tonight through Sunday night) Bebel Gilberto, the daughter of the bossa nova singer JoÃ£o Gilberto, updates bossa nova with touches of electronics and substitutes her own ebullience for her father's preternatural coolness. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; $30 (sold out). (Pareles)    DAVID GRAY (Wednesday) Mr. Gray's voice has a sharp, nervous quaver that keeps him sounding frayed and unpretty. He sings about tears and flames, seashores and rainy nights, strumming an acoustic guitar over his band's syncopated vamps; he owes a lot to Van Morrison. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212)247-4777,; $29.50 to $54.50. (Pareles)    HEARTLESS BASTARDS, WE ARE WOLVES (Tonight) Because of her primal yowl, the southern Ohio singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom is often compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. The hungry stomp of her power trio, Heartless Bastards, is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. The Montreal trio We Are Wolves opens. At 9, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    THE HOLD STEADY, THE ORANGES BAND (Tonight) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady frontman Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. The pleasantly droney pop rockers the Oranges Band open. At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703; $12. (Sinagra)    INTERPOL (Sunday) The dashing dark suits and dirgy post-punk rock of Interpol verges on haute Goth. But despite resonant baritone vocals that conjure Joy Division gloom, it is a groovy pop band at heart. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $31. (Sinagra)    NORAH JONES (Thursday) Norah Jones's voice may seem hesitant, yet on two hugely popular albums, she has quietly defined an adult pop that's touched by jazz, folk and country but beholden to none of them. She plays here at the T.J. Martell cancer research organization's Humanitarian Awards Gala. Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, in the Marriott Marquis Hotel, (212)833-5444; $1,000. (Pareles)    THE KILLERS, BRITISH SEA POWER (Tonight) Maybe it's their Las Vegas roots, maybe it's the singer Brendan Flowers's glam goof charisma or maybe it's their nostalgic preference for 80's MTV. Whatever the reason, the Killers are the pop smash of the neo-New Wave boomlet. British Sea Power puts a dreamy spin on dark new wave with its insistent baritone vocals and bright guitar lines. At 6:30, Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $35. (Sinagra)    JOHN MAYER TRIO, CHARLIE SEXTON (Thursday) Along with his songwriting chops, the sloe-eyed singer and guitarist John Mayer brings to the folk-rock sphere a winsome combination of earnest, sexy questing and easygoing humor. Charlie Sexton made his first record at 16, when he was hailed as a sort of new-wave roots rocker. Since then, he's played with Bob Dylan and produced for Lucinda Williams, and this year is preparing to tour with John Mayer. His own songs increasingly tend toward personal alt-country. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070; $45.50. (Sinagra)    O.A.R. (Monday) This jam band plays the sax and guitar reggae-inflected rock beloved by fans of the Dave Matthews Band. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $35. (Sinagra)    PAUL MCCARTNEY (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday nights) The ex-Beatle and former leader of Wings offers nostalgia to baby-boomers and graceful tunes and tidings of love to everyone else, in a voice that's perpetually guileless. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $54.50 to $279.50. (Pareles)    METRIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Hanes, this band finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Hanes's shuddering alto functions alternately as a weapon and a whip-cracking come-on. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. Thursday at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $14. (Sinagra)    NADA SURF (Thursday) These Brooklyn alt-rockers tumbled into obscurity after a mid-90's MTV hit, then re-emerged in 2002 with the lovingly ''Let Go'' (Barsuk), which squints nostalgically at imagined childhood bliss through a snowy pane. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE RAVEONETTES (Tuesday) Clearing away the garage noise of their debut, this Danish duo now strives for pure 60's pop classicism. Their latest material incorporates rock history, from girl groups to surf rock to punk, as well as historic rock in the form of cameos by Ronnie Spector, Suicide's Martin Rev and the Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker. At 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703; $15. (Sinagra)    GILBERTO SANTA ROSA (Tonight ) Salsa singers, or soneros, have borrowed a few ideas from Latin pop in recent years, ordering arrangements that are detailed for the radio as well as the dance floor. One of the most dynamic salsa performers is the trumpet-voiced, improvisatory singer Gilberto Santa Rosa, who holds on to the fundamentals: brassy, hard-swinging declamations of love songs and soaring improvisations traded with the band. 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $55 to $130. (Pareles)    SOCIAL DISTORTION (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) Social Distortion came out of the Southern California punk explosion of the late 1970's and stuck around. By now, its buzzsaw chords and minor-key melodies have taken on a tinge of roots rock, and Mike Ness has moved from singing about youthful frustrations to pondering adult choices and consequences. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $29. (Pareles)    TLEN-HUICANI (Sunday) The harpist Alberto de la Rosa leads this Mexican folk group, whose name means ''the singers.'' Its members play music specific to Veracruz -- from the lolling huasteco to the more rapid Southern jarocho -- as well as other Latin American styles. 7 p.m., Peter Norton Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)    ARMIN VAN BUUREN (Tonight) Though the Dutch trance DJ and producer Armin Van Buuren tends toward instrumentals and atmospherics, he never forgets his main duty: keeping those bodies moving, Ibiza-style. The extended set is a specialty. Doors open at 10, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212)629-9000; $30 in advance, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)    ZAP MAMA (Tuesday) This Afro-Belgian vocal group has grown ever more experimental through the years; its latest internationalist forays have moved into the realm of the remix, collaborating with programmer-producers. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940;$23. (Pareles)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    'SINGING ASTAIRE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The smart, airy revue that pays tribute to Fred Astaire, featuring Eric Comstock, Hilary Cole and Christopher Gines, has returned to Birdland.5:30 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; $30, with a $10 minimum for food or drink.(Stephen Holden)    *ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday through Thursday nights) In a courageous and successful leap into the unknown, Ms. Stritch makes her cabaret debut at 80. Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, she weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue of her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)744-1600; $105; $125 tonight and tomorrow (sold out).

(Nate Chinen)    RON BLAKE QUINTET (Wednesday) ''Sonic Tonic'' (Mack Avenue), Mr. Blake's most recent album, goes deeper than most hybrids of jazz, funk and soul; here the tenor saxophonist leads a group featuring the exploratory pianist Michael Cain. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    REGINA CARTER GROUP (Through Sunday) Ms. Carter is unquestionably one of jazz's top violinists, equally comfortable with burnished romanticism and blazing post-bop. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. (with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night), Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $25 to $30. (Chinen)    BILL CHARLAP TRIO (Tuesday through Oct. 16) Bright and breezy yet unfailingly precise, Mr. Charlap, the pianist, has come to exemplify jazz's modern mainstream. So has his working trio, which keeps a Tin Pan Alley repertory percolating in the present tense. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, south of 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    BENOÃT DELBECQ (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Delbecq is a French pianist given to intricate prepared timbres, in the manner of John Cage; as on the gently abstract album ''Nu-Turn'' (Songlines), he performs here in a solo setting. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $12.

(Chinen)    *TRIBUTE TO STEVE LACY (Thursday) Lacy, who died last year, is properly remembered as one of the finest soprano saxophonists of all time; what's somewhat less heralded is his compositional acumen. This concert addresses that oversight by enlisting Mr. Lacy's peers and inheritors -- like the trombonist Roswell Rudd, the saxophonists David Liebman and Joe Lovano, and the clarinetist Don Byron -- to interpret his works. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212)501-3330; $10.

(Chinen)    BILL MOBLEY'S MOB SCENE (Tuesday) This ensemble, led by Mr. Mobley, a trumpeter, cuts a clear path through the modern mainstream; as on the recent album ''Singularity'' (Blue Geodesics), Danny Walsh is the co-pilot on alto and tenor saxophones. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883; cover, $5. (Chinen)    JASON MORAN AND THE BANDWAGON (Through Sunday) Mr. Moran is a bright pianist who favors jagged, delirious polyphony; his uncommonly cohesive group, the Bandwagon, features the earthy yet slippery rhythm section of Tarus Mateen, bassist, and Nasheet Waits, drummer. 9 and 11 p.m. with a 12:30 set tomorrow night, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, south of 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.

Opera    'LA BOHÃME' (Tomorrow) Puccini's most popular opera has returned to the Metropolitan Opera in Franco Zeffirelli's audience-pleasing production.

(Jeremy Eichler)    'CARMEN' (Thursday) The Belgrade-born mezzo-soprano Milena Kitic, a star of the Yugoslavia Opera in her hometown, makes her Metropolitan Opera debut as Bizet's Carmen, a role she has performed to acclaim throughout Europe. With the golden-voiced Ruth Ann Swenson as Micaela, the powerful tenor Marco Berti as Don JosÃ© and the insightful conductor Philippe Jordan on the podium, there seem good reasons to revisit Franco Zeffirelli's overdone production. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $320.(Anthony Tommasini)    'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The attention to detail that characterizes this production is truly unusual: it's well cast, well acted and well conducted by a masterful James Levine. It also features the reigning Falstaff of our day, Bryn Terfel. He is matched note for note by the fabulous Stephanie Blythe, as Mistress Quickly, who almost steals the show. Go see it. Tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday night at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $42 to $320. (Anne Midgette)    'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's Japanese classic is one of City Opera's best. And there's a lot else to like here, from the intermittently good conducting of Ari Pelto to Jake Gardner's Sharpless. Furthermore, Shu-Ying Lee, who was magnificent in the title role when the Dicapo Opera presented all three versions of the opera last year, has taken it over here. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $16 to $120. (Midgette)    'MANON' (Tonight and Monday) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's production of Massenet's tragedy, absent from the Metropolitan Opera since 2001, returns with RenÃ©e Fleming as the conflicted Manon and Marcelo Ãlvarez as a passionate, and unusually well-rounded des Grieux.

(Bernard Holland)    'PATIENCE' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) City Opera's fast-moving, juiced-up version of ''Patience'' offers Gilbert and Sullivan's comic screed against aesthetic and intellectual presumption.

(Holland)    'TOSCA' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive, venerable and unbowed, the Amato Opera, a salty old-school denizen of New York, is presenting an even more venerable standby as the first production of its 58th season: Puccini's ''Tosca.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212)228-8200; $30, $25 for 65+, students with ID, and children. (Midgette)    'IL VIAGGIO A REIMS'  (Tomorrow and Tuesday) This is a delightful piece of comic froth, written by Rossini as an occasional piece, featuring a dozen soloists, in honor of the new French king. But if you're going to stage a piece that consists of nothing but star turns and virtuosic singing, it would help to have virtuosos or stars. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., City Opera, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; remaining tickets: $45 to $95 tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Tuesday.(Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music.

Oestreich)    'LORENZO DA PONTE: A BRIDGE FROM ITALY TO NEW YORK' (Wednesday) Even die-hard Mozart fans may not realize that Lorenzo Da Ponte, the composer's librettist for ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' emigrated to America in 1805 and, among other odd jobs, taught Italian language and literature at Columbia University. As the first event in a series of concerts and programs marking the 200th anniversary of Da Ponte's arrival, Columbia's Italian Academy presents the mezzo-soprano Krista River in a program of songs with texts by Da Ponte.

'EAST MEETS WEST' (Tomorrow) The excellent violinist Daniel Hope is often heard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art performing standard repertory as a member of the Beaux Arts Trio, but here he opens the Met's season on a much more eclectic note. The program features arrangements of familiar works like Ravel's ''Tzigane'' contrasted with Asian-tinged music and Indian ragas, for which Mr. Hope will be accompanied by Shyam Mohan on tabla and Gaurav Mazumdar on sitar. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949; $40.

(Kozinn)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) In the last three years Lorin Maazel has started the subscription seasons of the New York Philharmonic with the premiere of a commissioned work. This season is beginning more conventionally. The orchestra has commenced its overly hyped ''Elliott Carter Focus'' with the composer's early Holiday Overture, though the Mozart Concerto in A, K. 488 (with Jonathan Biss as soloist) and two scores by Strauss form the substance of the program (repeated today and tomorrow). On Wednesday night Charles Dutoit takes the podium to lead the Philharmonic in works by Ravel, Prokofiev (excerpts from ''Romeo and Juliet'') and Dvorak's Violin Concerto with the always rewarding violinist Sarah Chang. Maazel program: today at 2 p.m. and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Dutoit program: Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m. Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92. (Tommasini)    'ORION' (Tuesday and Thursday) In assembling this big work, commissioned for the Athens Olympics in 2004, Philip Glass seems to have been as much impresario as composer, bringing together longtime collaborators from around the world.

(Oestreich)    MAKI NAMEKAWA AND DENNIS RUSSELL DAVIES (Thursday) Though best known as a conductor, Dennis Russell Davies has a formidable keyboard technique that will be evident in this collaboration with Maki Namekawa, a young pianist who, like Mr. Davies, has a reputation as an eloquent new music player. Their program includes Messiaen's otherworldly ''Visions de l'Amen'' and works by Gyorgy Kurtag, Shoko Shida and Philip Glass. 8 p.m., Miller Theater at Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799; $25.

(La Rocco)    KO MUROBUSHI & EDGE (Thursday through Saturday) Mr. Murobushi, a disciple of the Butoh pioneer Tatsumi Hijikata, continues his master's dark legacy with a piece oddly redolent of spring, ''Handsome Blue Sky (Bibo No Aozora).'' 7:30 p.m., the Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)752-3015, www.japansociety.org; $35. (Kinetz)    *'WATCHING LIGETI MOVE: THREE BALLETS BY CHRISTOPhER WHEELDON' (Tonight and tomorrow night) To inaugurate its season and a festival devoted to the music of Gyorgy Ligeti, the Miller Theater presents dancers from the New York City Ballet and the San Francisco Ballet in three works choreographed by Mr. Wheeldon to Mr. Ligeti's music and never before presented on one program. At 8, Miller Theater, Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799 or www.millertheatre.com. (Rockwell)    KRIOTA WILLBERG/DURA MATER (Tonight, and tomorrow and Thursday nights) In her new multimedia ''Bentfootes,'' Ms. Willberg tells the story of 200 years of dance by the downtown choreographer Susan Bentfoote and her family. At 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, East Village, (212) 219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org; $10 to $15; T.D.F. accepted on Thursday. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic ''outsider'' category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by FabergÃ©. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia itself, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his own work artifacts that he has collected over the years, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossil stones to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the trylon and perisphere (a mini-sculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Grace Glueck).    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    *Adam Dant: 'Standing under' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, through Oct. 21. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    ARNO RAFAEL MINKKINEN: 'VINTAGE PHOTOGRAPHS, 1970-1980' Since the early 1970's, this Finnish-born photographer has been shooting parts of his nude body, mostly in conjunction with natural sites, his obsession leavened by humor. In one photograph his long, bony leg dangles disembodiedly over the stern of a broad-bottomed rowboat against a backdrop of lake, sky and firs; in another the soles of his feet appear magically in the branches of a tree, shot from below, the broad distortion of the feet concealing the body attached to them. Mr. Minkkinen's interest in the interaction of the nude body and the environment suggests the kind of ethereality that earthlings have always longed for. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)262-5050, through Oct. 8. (Glueck)    Henry Wolf Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the extraordinarily suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's own noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    DENNIS ADAMS: 'MAKE DOWN' This brainy political artist presents a video in which he uses film stills from the movie ''Battle of Algiers'' to wipe dark green makeup off his face and body. It's about terrorism, gender, masking and unmasking. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212)627-3680, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)    ANN AGEE: 'BOXING IN THE KITCHEN' A ceramicist with a playful and not too fussy touch, Ms. Agee has created a whimsical, tabletop landscape in which painted terra-cotta representations of friends and family members in different sorts of costumes cavort among cartoonish pink rock formations. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, (212)647-1044, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    *'Autonomy' Five promising young artists -- Melanie Schiff, Stephen G. Rhodes, Brett Lund, Nathan Hylden and Aaron Curry -- give modernism funk lessons at one of Chelsea's smartest and tiniest galleries. Sol Lewitt and Alexander Calder meet striped bikinis and rubber chickens. And, as in several other shows of late, sculpture, as a medium, is looking like an excellent idea. Foxy Production, 547 West 27th Street, No.6, (212)239-2758, through Oct. 8. (Cotter)    LAURA BATTLE Mathematically patterned spots and dots combine with fields of loose painterly abstraction in Ms. Battle's cosmically suggestive paintings and watercolors. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212)675-2656, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    *TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP'  A painter of eclectically layered abstractions has produced a surprising environmental installation: a slightly old-fashioned, fully equipped painter's studio made of brown corrugated cardboard and black paint. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, (212)727-8304, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    ADAM CVIJANOVIC: 'LOVE POEM (TEN MINUTES AFTER THE END OF GRAVITY)' With a deft, representational touch, Mr. Cvijanovic has painted an expansive, airy mural depicting what could be a scene in a Spielberg movie: a Los Angeles suburb that appears to have been violently uprooted and elevated into the sky. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212)929-5959, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    'Dialogue: Baldessari, Prince, Ruscha, Wool' Four paintings based on words make for a fine four-way conversation in yet another new micro-gallery. They include a funny-joke painting by Richard Prince, a menacing double-entendre by Christopher Wool, an art-about-art paradox by John Baldessari and an illusory farewell by Ed Ruscha. Perry Rubenstein, 534 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    'I'M A CHILD OF DIVORCE GIMME A BREAK' The clear leader for best title of the moment. This exhibition, featuring media-saturated collages and sculptures by Michael St. John, and single works by 10 others, is worth a visit, too. Highlights include a sweet, glossy cartoon painting of a hippopotamus by Adrian Ting; a tenderly painted portrait of a cherubic demon by Elizabeth Olbert; a painterly Pop-style picture of a Bromo Seltzer bottle from 1984 by Walter Robinson; and aggressively physical abstract paintings by Suzanne McClelland, Gary Stephan and Josh Smith. Cynthia Broan, 546 West 29th Street, (212)760-0809, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    LAURA LARSON: 'APPARITION' For mysterious reasons, a lot of people these days are interested in photography of the supernatural. Ms. Larson creates rich color photographs of forest interiors and rooms in an abandoned psychiatric asylum in which wisps of smoke or mist suggest spiritual presences. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, (212)941-0012, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    Barry Le Va: '9g-Wagner: Variation II' A large work that was featured in Mr. Le Va's recent retrospective at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia inaugurates this gallery's new home in Chelsea. A severe yet playful arrangement of panels on the wall and variously shaped black boxes and cylinders on the floor, the installation evokes associations with early Modernist abstraction, Minimalism and hip department store dÃ©cor. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212)223-2227, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'MUD' This exceptional four-artist show of small sculpture features lively, insouciant ceramics by the painter Joanne Greenbaum; crusty, off-white ceramics by Elliott Levine that look like ancient artifacts; cartoonish sculptures about modern machines by Aga Ousseinov; and rough, semiabstract sculptures in Styrofoam and papier mÃ¢chÃ©, alluding to landscapes and furniture, by Yuh-Shioh Wong. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212)947-2818, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    ORLAN/BRIAN BELOTT Orlan, the French performance artist, turns from surgical to digital alterations of her features, which she merges with Pre-Columbian artifacts. Mr. Belott pursues more low-tech methods in painted collages, handmade books and a touching slide show of images from other people's lives. Stefan Stux Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, (212)352-1600, through Oct. 15. (Smith)    PALOMA VARGA WEISZ: 'CHOR' In a demure New York debut dominated by carved limewood busts, this German artist attempts to vivify a late-Gothic figurative style with intimations of Minimalism, Conceptualism and Surrealism. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Oct. 8. (Smith)    *'Pop Politics Power' In this measured but intense three-artist show, Martha Rosler offers a continuation of her 1967-72 photomontage series ''Bringing the War Home''; Carolee Schneemann is represented by both a new film and by her mesmerizing 1965 ''Viet Flakes,'' in which a rush of grainy black-and-white war photographs looks like smoke billowing from a volcano; and Robert Boyd introduces two spooky videos about doomsday religious cults, past, present and (probably) future. LMAKprojects, 526 West 26th Street, No.310, (212)255-9707, through Oct. 8. (Cotter)    *MONIQUE PRIETO AND LYNDA BENGLIS Ms. Prieto has, in effect, boarded over her abstract paintings with rough-hewn monolithic letters quoting Samuel Pepys's famous diary. Both the wordiness and the klunkiness are a bit familiar, but extracting Pepys's phrases, which are all deliberately disembodied in reference, can be strangely satisfying. In ''The Graces,'' Ms. Benglis continues to evoke figures by other means, in this case three shimmering stacks of vaselike forms made of heavily textured, lavender-tinted resin. The material is perfect for the process-oriented Ms. Benglis, even if her current applications are similar to the work of Andrew Lord and Beverly Semmes. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Oct. 15. (Smith)    Bill Rice: 'The View from 13 East 3rd' This small show is a chance to catch up with some of this pioneering New York artist's paintings and collages from the 1960's onward. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, second floor, (212)242-6242 , through Oct. 8. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    *JIM ISERMANN A California-based pioneer of art about design, Mr. Isermann here presents a single, long, wraparound wall made of white plastic diamond-shaped modules. It is a canny conflation of Minimalism, Pop and Op Art with subtly thrilling visual effects. Deitch, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)343-7300, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    OHAD MEROMI: 'CYCLOPS' The jarring mixtures of mediums, narratives and genres in the video and installation work of this young Israel-born artist need more focus and entertainment value, but they smartly see that the field of set-up video is relatively open right now, with plenty of room for worlds to collide. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, South Village, (212)206-1290, through Oct. 8. (Smith)    'PAPER MUSEUMS: THE REPRODUCTIVE PRINT IN EUROPE, 1500-1800' From the early 16th century to the beginning of the 19th, prints that reproduced the original work of artists were the only means of acquainting a broad public with the creative endeavors of DÃ¼rer, Raphael, Rubens, Michelangelo and the like. This show displays the variety and vitality of such reproductive prints, and points up how they effectively circulated artists' works and ideas in Europe. Don't expect lots of pictorial splash here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212)998-6780, through Dec. 3. (Glueck)    Debra Priestly: 'somewhere listening' Ms. Priestly's poetic meditation on ancestry and history consists of life-size charcoal portraits of her own grandparents and six other heroic 19th-century figures of African-American and Indian descent, accompanied by the sounds of old family audio recordings emanating from a set of soup tureens. June Kelly, 591 Broadway, SoHo, (212)226-1660, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    Last Chance    *PHILIP JONES GRIFFITHS For half a century, this documentary photographer has been placing himself squarely in harm's way to record military violence. His pictures of the American war in Vietnam, which make up a substantial part of this show, amount to one of the great tragic portraits of their time, and are required viewing in ours. Denise Bibro Fine Art Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fourth floor, (212)647-7030, closing tomorrow.
