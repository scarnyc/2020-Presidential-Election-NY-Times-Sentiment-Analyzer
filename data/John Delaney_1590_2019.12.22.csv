0,"Laura Sinagra reviews new album by folk singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens, who is appearing at Bowery Ballroom; photo (S)",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/19/arts/movies/the-listings-aug-19-aug-25-sufjan-stevens.html,"Laura Sinagra reviews new album by folk singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens, who is appearing at Bowery Ballroom; photo (S)","You could say that the indie folk singer-songwriter and banjoist Sufjan Stevens believes in state's rights. That is, this Detroit native and questing Christian, now living in Brooklyn, believes in every state's right to be the subject of a gentle, exhaustive album. His second offering in this monumental project, ""Illinois"" (Asthmatic Kitty), is a 22-song swing through Prairie State history. Of course, historical tidbits like the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, homesteader hardship and the relative debating talents of Lincoln and Douglas mostly provide a jump-off for self-reflection. A man of his times, the 30-year-old Mr. Stevens, above, is both a legitimate history buff and a Google tourist. He is imbued with an outward-looking, Copland-esque musical vision and a narcissistic idea of the surveyable self reminiscent of Walt Whitman, though his lyrics can have an emo overreach and his compositions tend to forge into the folksily baroque. But his quiet, assured voice and pained personal revelations keep things intimate. At his best, Mr. Stevens has our pleasure in mind, as when the humorously titled ""Come on, Feel the Illinoise"" slides out of its complex meter into a simpler rhythm. When Mr. Stevens's lyrical approach succeeds, as in his account of a friend's death from bone cancer, falling on Casimir Pulaski Day, it can be breathtaking. When it doesn't, it can be a trifle maddening, especially when the melody is indelible. An antifolk aria about John Wayne Gacy disingenuously turns a falsetto lament for the killer's victims into an inward-looking recrimination. But such indulgences are forgivable for an emotional cartographer who promises so much.

4,"Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'LENNON' Opens Sunday. The latest jukebox musical (with a Yoko-approved biographical story of this beloved musician) boasts three rare and unpublished tunes to go with all your old favorites (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.'JOY' Opens Sunday. Formerly titled ''The Joy of Gay Sex,'' John Fisher's romantic comedy, which received its New York premiere earlier this year, follows a group of college friends over the course of one eventful year in San Francisco (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.  'BAGHDAD BURNING' Opens Tuesday. A dramatization of the blog of a 25-year-old Iraqi who goes by the name Riverbend. Perhaps the first blog-play ever. Part of Women Center Stage 2005 (1:30). Below Theater at the Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101.  'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Opens Thursday. Nathan Lane and Marian Seldes star in a new Terrence McNally play about a couple who want to buy a theater in upstate New York (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. 'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' Previews start Thursday. Opens Aug. 25. After a hit run at P.S. 122, this hilarious collection of auditioning nightmares returns. (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100.  'TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Aug. 28. One of the Public Theater's early Broadway transfers, this 1971 musical adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy features lyrics by John Guare and music by Galt MacDermot. Kathleen Marshall directs (2:45). The Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater, Central Park, entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West and at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)239-6200.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)  'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)  'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)  'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'  (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schreiber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)  'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). The Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)  'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)  'THE DEAR BOY' An uptight English teacher learns to cut loose, at least a bit, when he's confronted with an unflattering portrait written by a gifted but troubled student. Capably acted, but lacking in real substance (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)  'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)  'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)  'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'IVANOV' Jonathan Banks's staging of the Chekhov classic ''Ivanov'' with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of that of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jonathan Kalb)  'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)  'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)  'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' The hand of fate reaches all the way into a steaming hot tub filled with cranky women in this seriocomic lesbian soap opera from the Five Lesbian Brothers. A richly funny Sapphic sex comedy, it is also a serious inquiry into the unforeseen extremities of despair that can attend the search for a lasting love (1:30). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)460-5475. (Isherwood)  'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)  'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cell phones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)  'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful and funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful emotional crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)  'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)  'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)  'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. ( Zinoman)    Off Off Broadway    'BROTHER' Nothing is quite what it seems at first in ''Brother,'' Lisa Ebersole's confrontational one-act play about a pair of sisters who taunt each other, and a black man who suddenly joins them in the middle of the night in an East Village apartment. The audience is uncomfortably close to the action in this theater-in-the-round production, which starts with an ambiguous tension that quickly escalates (55 minutes). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban)  'THE PERSIANS' Though he himself fought with the victorious Greeks, Aeschylus wrote the tragedy of ''The Persians'' entirely from the perspective of the vanquished. This imaginative musical production by a young company called Waterwell extends that act of empathy, while also managing to be wildly funny and entertaining (1:15). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)  'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment. (1:45) Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)  'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)  'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)  'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)  'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)  'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)  'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)  'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)  'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited. (1:30) Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)  'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)  'PRIMO' In his crystalline adaptation of ''If This Is a Man,'' Primo Levi's memoir of the Holocaust, Antony Sher creates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of existence. His great accomplishment is in doing so in an expressly theatrical language that never sensationalizes, lectures or begs for pity (1:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)  'THE SKIN GAME' A powerful performance by James Gale propels the Mint Theater's revival of ''The Skin Game.'' The Nobel laureate John Galsworthy's drama about two English families whose differences escalate into destructive conflict provides provocative and entertaining theater (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231, closing on Sunday. (Van Gelder)  'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)  'WALK TWO MOONS' Theaterworks/NYC, the new ''stationary'' arm of the traveling group Theaterworks/USA, starts things off with an appealing adaptation of the tweener novel by Sharon Creech, a Newbery Medal winner. A 13-year-old girl travels cross-country with her nutty grandparents in search of her mother, telling a tallish tale about her friend Phoebe along the way, to hilarious effect (1:10). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)  'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of the 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Manohla Dargis)  'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his own novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the early 1970's, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)  'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)  'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)  * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers -- including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange -- and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)  'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)  'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)  'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)  'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)   'THE CONFORMIST' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Italian) Bertolucci's 1970's look at the soul man under Fascism returns to take us back not only to the Mussolini years, but also, more dramatically, to the time of its own making, a cinematic era of stylistic daring and aesthetic bravura. (Scott)  'CRASH'  (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)  'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis)  * 'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. Through Aug. 16. (Scott)  'THE DUKES OF HAZZARD' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Yeee-haw? Naw. (Scott)  'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis)  'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)   'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy, about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home, envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of his pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation and about how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)  'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)   'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)  'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)  'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)  'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)  'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of the exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)  'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)  *'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)  '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)  'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)  'OYSTER FARMER' (not rated, 93 minutes) ''Oyster Farmer,'' the Australian writer-director Anna Reeves's debut feature, soaks up the lush scenery of the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales, a setting that often takes precedence over the underdeveloped story and characters, including Jack, a 24-year-old petty thief who's a newcomer to the unglamorous but strangely fascinating world of oyster farming. An uneven but ultimately endearing film that manages to portray ordinary life in a refreshingly authentic way. (Laura Kern)  'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring. (Scott)  'SAINT RALPH' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This story of a 14-year-old Canadian schoolboy in the early 1950's who believes in miracles is pure treacle. (Holden) 'SARABAND' (R, 107, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden)  *'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) ''Secuestro Express'' is a relentless assault on the senses about a trio of hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul Leroux), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money's arrival. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Kern)   'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question, ''Is there life after high school?,'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)  'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)  'STEALTH' (PG-13, 117 minutes) A preposterous hash of ''Top Gun'' and ''Behind Enemy Lines,'' topped with a soupçon of ''2001,'' this crypto-video game about three stealth pilots has the makings of a kitsch classic; too bad it's not remotely funny. (Dargis)  'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) A delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, ''Tony Takitani'' tells the story of a lonely man who at 37 awakens to life for the first time during a brief idyll. The film was directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)   '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)   ' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)  'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    DIVAS! (through Aug. 30). This summer festival, presented by Thalia Film Classics, honors great women in classical movies, with dramas about very different protagonists. Bette Davis stars as a Southern belle with attitude in ''Jezebel'' (1938). And in ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951), Ava Gardner plays a Spanish femme fatale who falls in love with a ghost. Both films play tomorrow and on Tuesday. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-1414; $10. (Anita Gates)  DESERT ISLAND FILM FESTIVAL (through Aug. 20). Makor, a program of the 92nd Street Y, begins a six-day, five-film festival of movies that its audiences voted most desirable to have around if they were trapped on a desert island. The series begins on Monday with Orson Welles's masterpiece ''Citizen Kane'' (1941), followed by Michael Curtiz's ''Casablanca'' (1942), Francis Ford Coppola's original ''Godfather'' (1972), Woody Allen's ''Manhattan'' (1979) and Quentin Tarantino's ''Pulp Fiction'' (1994). 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)601-1000; $9. (Gates)  'EVERYBODY WAS KUNG-FU FIGHTING: THE SHAW BROTHERS' (through Aug. 21). BAMcinématek's retrospective of films from the Shaw Brothers studio in Hong Kong continues this weekend with three films: Li Han Hsiang's ''Empress Dowager'' (''Xi tai hou,'' 1975), an epic set during the Qing Dynasty, tonight; Chu Yuan's ''Intimate Confessions of a Chinese Courtesan'' (''Ai Nu,'' 1972), about a kidnapped rich girl sold to a brothel, tomorrow night; and Chang Cheh's ''Golden Swallow'' (''Hsia yu-yen,'' 1968), starring Cheng Pei Pei as a kung fu master determined to change her life, on Sunday. All the films being screened are restored prints. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)777-3456 or (718)636-4100; $10. (Gates)  FILMS IN THE PARK WITH LIVE MUSIC AND DANCE On Thursday Fort Greene Park Conservancy and African Film Festival screens its second outdoor movie preceded by live music. The feature is Jason Xenopoulos's ''Critical Assignment'' (2003), an action film about a crusading journalist who comes home to Africa to fight corrupt politicians and save the water supply. Fort Greene Park, Myrtle Avenue and North Portland entrance, Brooklyn. In case of rain: Lafayette Presbyterian Church, 85 South Oxford Street, at Lafayette Street, Fort Greene; www.africanfilmny.org or www.fortgreenepark.org. Free. (Gates)  RAOUL WALSH RETROSPECTIVE (through Sunday). The Museum of the Moving Image's 23-film tribute to Walsh (1887-1980) ends this weekend. ''Manpower'' (1941), a blue-collar romance with Edward G. Robinson and Marlene Dietrich, is to be shown tomorrow. ''Pursued'' (1947), a noirish western starring Robert Mitchum and Teresa Wright, is scheduled for tomorrow and Sunday. ''Colorado Territory'' (1949), a sort of western version of ''High Sierra,'' with Joel McCrea and Virginia Mayo, is on Sunday. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    YOLANDA ADAMS (Tomorrow) Blending gospel and R&B, Yolanda Adams has an undeniably powerful voice, though it is used more for purposes of warm inspiration and uplifting solace than quasi-sexual shudders of praise. 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777; free. (Laura Sinagra)  TORI AMOS, THE LIKE (Wednesday) The piano-grinding sensualist Tori Amos spent the 1990's rendering stormy emotional experience via alt-rock drama, pounded out on a well-worn Bösendorfer piano and sung in a shamanic, childlike voice. Lately, she's been seeking the Goddess in biblical lore and reflecting on the nuances of married sexuality. The Like, from Los Angeles, is an all-female trio of pleasingly jaded Tori acolytes. 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $20 to $50. (Sinagra)   ANTIBALAS (Thursday) Antibalas delivers a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. Rocks Off Boat Cruise, World Yacht Marina, 41st Street, at the Hudson River, Clinton, (212)571-3304; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles)  BEACH BOYS (Tonight and tomorrow) Scores of young rock bands continue to tap into Brian Wilson's harmonically rich melancholic whimsy, updating the most influential sound in American rock. The singer Mike Love owns the Beach Boys name and clings to a Six Flags version of the band's earliest suburban utopianism. Mr. Wilson won't be here, but he's performing in town this week, too. (See below.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y.,(516)334-0800; $53. (Sinagra)  CODY CHESNUTT (Tomorrow) An aesthetic acolyte of Prince, among others, the eccentric do-it-yourself neo-soul singer and multi-instrumentalist Mr. Chesnutt wears his machismo prominently, blending funky spiritual questing with tomcat instincts. The fevered enthusiasm that surrounded his ambitious two-disc debut has cooled a bit, but we expect that he's still groovy and unpredictable. 7 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $15. (Sinagra)  KIMYA DAWSON (Monday) Ms. Dawson's band, the Moldy Peaches, featured adorable dirty-kid rambles that created an indie splash in 2001. But this former youth counselor endures on her own as a slant comedian and poignant poet of geek love and underdog resilience. 7 p.m., Scenic, 25 Avenue B, between Second and Third Streets, East Village, $8. (Sinagra)  DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, THE DECEMBERISTS, STARS (Thursday) Death Cab is a decorous diarist-rock band whose sound gets added alternative-rock heft on the forthcoming ''Plans'' (Atlantic). The Decemberists' leader, Colin Melloy, writes literary songs about child queens, heartsick spies and vengeful seafarers. The Canadian band the Stars' achingly pretty boy-girl vocal pop makes a dreamy soundtrack for a quarter-life crisis. 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777; $30 in advance, $35 on the day; sold out. (Sinagra)  NEIL DIAMOND (Thursday) After four decades, during which his initial kicky folk-rock evolved into high-gloss Vegas pop, the singer-songwriter Neil Diamond has recently been working with the rock and rap producer Rick Rubin, who famously helped Johnny Cash garner an alt-rock audience in the 90's. Spare new songs reportedly rely on acoustic guitar and aim for a lonesome vibe. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $70 to $100. (Sinagra)  DIPSET NYC VS. PIRATE SESSIONS UK (Tomorrow) Inspired by the seminal hip-hop film ''Wild Style,'' in which uptown music is taken downtown for a good-will concert in East River Park, this show aims to catalyze interplay between the purveyors of British grime and the gritty but playful stateside hip-hop of the Dipset crew in Harlem. Performers include Def Jam's Juelz Santana and Britain's Kano, who also performs tomorrow evening. (See below.) 2 p.m., East River Park Amphitheater, Grand Street at the East River, Lower East Side, (212)560-0951; free. (Sinagra)  DR. JOHN, MARCIA BALL BLUES BAND (Tomorrow) Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and florid piano playing to jazz standards and songs with a conscience. Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time. 7:30 p.m., Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center; free. (Pareles).  HIEROGLYPHICS, FEATURING DEL THE FUNKY HOMOSAPIEN (Sunday) This Bay Area hip-hop crew has been together since the mid-90's heyday of tricky, frequently self-deprecating backpack hip-hop. Fans of Del who lament this eccentric rhyme-spitter's absence from the new Gorillaz album can check out his solo bounce. His crew members Casual, Pep Love, Domino and Souls of Mischief also play. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, 8 p.m.; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)  HOLLY GOLIGHTLY, TOM HEINL (Tuesday and Thursday) The British retro garage-country Holly Golightly writes and sings twangy ditties with Nancy Sinatra sass. The Oregonian Tom Heinl performs indie pop to a karaoke machine, calling what he does ''stereoke.'' Tuesday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $12. Thursday at 8:30 p.m. (with Tralala, who play ironic surf-rock topped with girl-group vocals), Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $19. (Sinagra)  KARSH KALE (Sunday) Karsh Kale is a tabla player, disc jockey and producer who layers East and West into his own version of the Asian underground blend of dance beats and South Asian rhythms and melodies. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)239-6200; $20. (Pareles)   KANO, DIPLO (Tomorrow) Kano is Kane Robinson, a 20-year-old M.C. from the Bow neighborhood of London, who rhymes with an easy flow and a bit less slang than fellow purveyors of the sometimes insular British grime rap. He also plays in the afternoon with members of the New York rap crew Dipset. (See above.) The Philadelphia D.J. Diplo has taken the crate-digging white kid routine global, weaving hip-hop and new wave with dancehall and Brazilian baille funk. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132; $12. (Sinagra)  BARRINGTON LEVY, TOKYO SKA PARADISE ORCHESTRA (Sunday) The crooner Barrington Levy headlines this free concert of well-known reggae performers. Mr. Levy arrived with the hit ''Shine Eye Girl'' in 1979 and showed Jamaican singers how to ride a choppy digital beat; he has periodically revitalized his career by roughing up his songs with raps from top dancehall toasters and Snoop Dogg. The high-energy Japanese ska band Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra opens. 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, free. (Pareles)   METHOD MAN, STREET LIFE (Tomorrow) Method Man's unlikely combination of a gravelly M.C. voice, menacing grimace and impeccable comic timing has garnered this member of Wu Tang Clan fame as both the ominous rapper on scary cuts like ''Bring the Pain'' and, with his fellow rapper Redman, as one-half of an affably stoned slapstick screen duo. His pal Street Life also performs. Midnight, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $28 in advance, 30 at the door. (Sinagra)  THE MISFITS (Tonight) This New Jersey institution has remained dedicated to its campy, horror-flick punk rock over two decades after the departure of the singer Glen Danzig. The current lineup, led by the original member Jerry Only, includes the former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and Marky Ramone on drums. At 7, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052; $30.  (Sinagra)  MÖTLEY CRÜE, SUM 41 (Sunday and Tuesday) Mötley Crüe's 80's hits -- ''Shout at the Devil,'' ''Girls, Girls, Girls,'' ''Dr. Feelgood'' -- defined 80's hair metal at its most inane and often most effective. They've been reclaimed with an ironic enthusiasm impassioned enough to feel almost like sincerity. The members of the energetic pop-metal Sum 41, of the hit ''Fat Lip,'' are still young enough to do that thing where they jump in the air at once and land hard on a power chord. Sunday at 6 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400; $20 to $75. Tuesday at 6 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $20 to $75. (Sinagra)  NEW YORK DOLLS (Tonight) Once called the world's most dangerous band, the glammy, proto-punk New York Dolls continue a reunion that began last year, before the death of its original bassist, Arthur Kane. The still charismatically campy David Johansen and the guitarist Sylvain Sylvain plan on putting out a record with their new band next year. Doors open at 7 p.m., Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732)238-5500; $20. (Sinagra)  OXFORD COLLAPSE (Tomorrow) The Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic mid-American forebears like the Embarrassment. 9 p.m., Glass House Gallery, 38 South First Street, between Wythe & Kent, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 917-607-1017, suggested donation $5. (Sinagra)  DOLLY PARTON (Thursday) Science has kept her young, but Dolly Parton is naturally likable. As of late, this legendary country warbler has moved from the classic tear-jerkers like ''Coat of Many Colors'' and ''Jolene'' toward the bluegrass-inflected music of her Tennessee mountain home. She's also currently recording with guests from Keith Urban to Norah Jones. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212)632-4000; $40 to $75. (Sinagra)  PERNICE BROTHERS (Tomorrow) Possessed of one of the sexiest regular-guy voices in indie rock, Joe Pernice has been making charmingly dark, low-key pop for over a decade. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)  PUFFY AMIYUMI  (Thursday) Hugely popular in Japan since the late 90's, this two-girl anime tie-in duo, Ami Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura, sing spunky tunes that make J-pop ersatz of even the most prefab 60's and 70's American rock. Think Partridge Family with superpowers, Shonen Knife without the edge, or a kiddie cocktail version of sophisto lounge acts like Pizzicato Five. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)  RAY, GOODMAN AND BROWN (Thursday) Ray, Goodman and Brown, who recorded as the Moments until 1979, carried smooth soul into the 1980's with hits like ''Special Lady.'' 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17, South and Fulton Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212)732-7678; free. (Pareles)  KENNY ROGERS (Sunday) You assume that the man who wrote the countrified radio smash ''The Gambler'' knows when to fold 'em, and evidently that time has yet to come. Other hits to be trotted out here will surely include the sing-along recrimination ''Lucille'' and the casually rendered tale of gnarly violence ''Coward of the County.'' 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800; $52. (Sinagra)  ROLL DEEP CREW (Tonight) Roll Deep is the gritty East London grime crew that includes the clever, angular rapper Dizzee Rascal and tonight's headliner, Wiley. Recently they have been branching out sonically beyond the stripped-down beats and willfully impenetrable patois of the genre to reach a wider audience. At 11:30, Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $12. (Sinagra)  SAW DOCTORS (Tonight) The Saw Doctors sing earnest, folk-rocking anthems of small-town life ''for those who feel they've been mistreated/discriminated, robbed or cheated.'' In Ireland, their populism brought them a huge national following. At 8, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $30 in advance, $32. (Pareles)  SMOG (Tonight) The lo-fi rock icon Bill Callahan has been living in Austin, Tex., for a few years now, and it seems to have mellowed him. His latest album, ''A River Ain't Too Much to Love'' (Drag City), is a pensive, acoustic guitar-pickin' affair, more reflective and even wistful than knowing and sardonic. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)  VANS WARPED TOUR 2005 (Tomorrow) Buzz pop-punk and pop-metal bands like Atreyu, Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance join elder statesmen like the Offspring and corpuscular outfits like Bleeding Through, Bleed the Dream and the Bled to provide enough soft-loud guitar and emo-tinged howls to validate more adolescent angst than the forthcoming school year may even contain. 12 p.m., Randall's Island Golf Center, 1 Randall's Island, (212)427-5689; $34 in advance, $38 at the door. (Sinagra)  BRIAN WILSON (Tonight and tomorrow night) Last year, the shaky Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson finally finished ''Smile'' (Nonesuch), the quintessential American record of 1966. Its sweeping crackpot Gershwin homages and baroque Van Dyke Parks lyrics cast a dark shadow over burnished American iconography from Plymouth Rock to Blue Hawaii to Mrs. O'Leary's cow. His former bandmate Mike Love leads a reconstituted Beach Boys show this week as well (see above), but his renditions are far less relevant. Tonight at 8, PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400; $20 to $65. Tomorrow night at 8, Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $20 to $65. (Sinagra)    Cabaret  Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

Opera    AFTERNOON ARIAS (Today) A new summer series of free concerts features opera arias, with piano, performed by singers from the New York City Opera's roster in the somewhat bucolic if not acoustically ideal surroundings of Bryant Park.

(Anne Midgette)  GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Thursday) Is it a leading opera company or an experimental theater, a proving ground for young artists or a showcase for stars? Glimmerglass aspires to be all these things with a summer season that ranges from an austere production of Britten's valedictory ''Death in Venice'' to ''Lucie de Lammermoor,'' a French-language version of Donizetti's classic that verges, inadvertently, on comic relief. But through ups and downs there's a lot to like: take the American tenor William Burden, incandescent in the Britten as the writer Gustav von Aschenbach. Also on the summer program are Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte'' and an unusual double bill consisting of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's one-acter ''La Voix Humaine,'' which depicts a woman on the phone. ''Portrait'' and ''Voix,'' tonight and Thursday night at 8; ''Lucie,'' tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 2 p.m.; ''Death in Venice,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m.; ''Così,'' Sunday and Tuesday at 2 p.m. Alice Busch Theater, Route 80, eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607)547-2255; sold out.

Tomorrow morning, panels start at 10 with ''Memory and History,'' featuring two Copland biographers.

The focus shifts to France tomorrow and Sunday, when Eugenia Zukerman, a flutist, is joined by the pianist Jeffrey Biegel, the bassist Pablo Aslan and the percussionist John Hollenbeck in works by Rameau, Debussy, Poulenc and Claude Bolling, whose ''Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano'' was a crossover hit in the late 1970's.

(Kozinn)  BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight through Thursday) The flutist Marya Martin did not want to spend summers trekking to far-flung festivals, so she and her husband, Ken Davidson, founded a festival of their own, now in its 22nd season.

(Anthony Tommasini)  MARLBORO MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Traditionally the programs for the weekend concerts at this festival in Vermont have not been announced in advance. But this summer Marlboro has been alerting the public to what works will be played on the concerts, and the three programs this weekend, the final weekend of the festival's 55th season, look very enticing. Tonight brings Strauss's seldom heard Suite in B flat for winds, Brahms's String Quintet in F and Mendelssohn's rhapsodic Piano Trio in D minor. Tomorrow Mozart's Quintet in E flat for piano and winds, Elliott Carter's String Quartet No. 2 and Brahms's Horn Trio can be heard.

(Kozinn)  'TRANSIENT GLORY' (Today and tomorrow) Writing music for children's chorus doesn't have the cachet of, say, writing for a symphony orchestra. But Francisco J. Núñez, founder of the Young People's Chorus of New York City, has set out to change that by commissioning major composers -- Ned Rorem, David Del Tredici, Judith Weir, Bright Sheng -- to write works for his ensemble.

The group's weeklong series of concerts concludes with performances this afternoon at 12:30 and tomorrow evening at 7:30.

This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)  AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)  BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)  COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,'  through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 28. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith)  GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM,'  through Aug. 24. With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with a number of different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. When, at the end of the 1950's, he felt he had met his goal, Oteiza turned to Basque political and social causes. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) (Glueck)  INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)  METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)   MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith)  MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400.(Michael Kimmelman)  MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. (See above.) (Johnson)  MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)   NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)  THE NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans both before and after World War II and presaged aspects of Pop Art and Neo-Expressionism. This meager show does not give a full account of either his strengths or his weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)  NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)   NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)  P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)  QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Oct. 9. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)  STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENSLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23. Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)  UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)  WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck) WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)  WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: Uptown    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook in which he recorded his visual impressions, this show of some 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of spired churches, sailboats and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)  IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)  Galleries: 57th Street   'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person mini-shows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)  'REPEAT PERFORMANCE'  More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' This big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Aug. 19. (Cotter)  WILLIAM EGGLESTON 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Sept. 2 (Johnson)  GEERT GOIRIS, Among the most striking of the sumptuous and magical color photographs by this Belgian artist are pictures of an albino wallaby and of a mysterious explosion in a peaceful, parklike setting. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212)989-7700, through Aug. 23. (Johnson)  DAVID LEVINTHAL: 'XXX SEX DOLLS' Mr. Levinthal is known for his provocatively ironic photographs of war toys, racist kitsch and pornographic dolls. Here, along with faux-pornographic photographs, he presents 30 female miniatures from his collection; they are kitschy marvels of sexist fetishism. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212)627-4819, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)  JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of the store itself, but to round out a long, hot city summer, the artist Justin Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)  LIU ZHENG: 'THE CHINESE' Under the influence of Sander, Frank and Arbus, this Chinese photographer set out to document his own society with a focus on the dark and wild side. His pictures of miners, prisoners, strippers, transsexuals, hospital patients and corpses have an almost surrealistic intensity. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212)414-0370, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)  'MEDITATIVE' The mellow but disciplined vibes emanating from this group show are partly attributable to its theme: all the work was inspired by the artists' experiences of meditation. Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212)675-7772, through Sept. 17. (Cotter)  BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20- inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)  'REMARKABLE HANDS' Three Japanese make art by hand: Yayoi Deki creates gently psychedelic floral patterns with a finely pointed brush; Yoko Kawamoto paints small, photo-based pictures of junked cars and industrial sites with a dry but sensuous touch; and Tomoo Gokita, using chameleonlike skill and mischievous humor, draws many different kinds of pop culture imagery. ATM, 511 West 20th Street, (212)375-0349, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)  'WORDPLAY' Twenty-three artists toy with words and letters. The show includes comical, professional-looking signs by Steve Powers; sign letters arranged to spell ''Me'' in a photograph by Jack Pierson; a neon sign that says ''Just Wait,'' by Bill Rowe; an alphabet of letters made of little water puddles photographed by Abelardo Morell; and layered, hand-painted letters spelling the hidden phrase ''Weapons of Mass Destruction'' by Joe Amrhein. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)  JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalismand utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)  MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft-drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)  'CAPTURING A MOMENT-ITO' Highlights of this varied exhibition of works by nine Latino artists include Karina Aguilera Skvirsky's eerie video of vaguely menacing figures in Mideastern-style robes approaching in a peaceful park; portraits by Gabriel de la Mora in which the apparently finely drawn lines are actually made of hair from the people depicted; Gino Rubert's Surrealistic paintings of dreamy erotic encounters; and Alfonso Cantú's drawings of people viewed through marbled glass. Jamaica Center for Arts & Learning, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, (718)658-7400, through Aug. 20. (Johnson)   'A. B. NORMAL'  Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyper-realistic zamboni made of rigid pale green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)  JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    RALPH BACERRA: 'OPULENT FIRE' Beautiful and technically awe-inspiring new teapots by this Los Angeles-based ceramicist have organically shaped, multipart bodies cast from tree branches and surfaces richly glazed in fine geometric patterns. Garth Clark, 25 West 56th Street, Chelsea, (212)246-2205, closing today. (Johnson)  'BEBE LE STRANGE'  This tense, lively group show devoted to images of the figure includes strong work by a bunch of strong young artists, including Benjamin Degen, William Jones and Eileen Quinlan, and fascinating photographic work of documentary fiction by Zoe Crosher and Leslie Grant. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-9460, closing today. (Cotter)  'GREY FLAGS'  Organized by the artist Seth Price, this coolest of summer group shows puts New York art on an interesting track and looks to the future. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)680-9467, closing today. (Cotter)  'STICKS & STONES' Images of skulls dominate this group show of mostly drawings by John White Cerasulo, Santiago Cucullu and Andrew Guenther, with an ambitious, multipart marker-on-photocopy piece by Jay Heikes.

9,Pop.,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/arts/music/rockpop-listings.html,Pop.,"THE HOLD STEADY Imagine the best bar band you've ever seen. Now imagine it fronted by a guy with punk attitude, a def poet's way with words and some ripping yarns to tell. That frontman is Craig Finn of the Hold Steady. Since moving to Brooklyn a few years back, Mr. Finn, above center, has continued to draw inspiration from his adolescent antics in the Upper Midwest. But his Minneapolis of the mind is no artistic and agricultural idyll. Just like that city's other punk rock bard, Paul Westerberg of the Replacements, Mr. Finn fondly describes a cold and agitated milieu. It's a place where Catholic kids go bad, skip catechism class to sniff OxyContin in caves on the Mississippi Riverbanks, and race drunk down frontage roads. Mr. Finn's singular ranting bark combines Bruce Springsteen's passion with a kind of slacker stream of consciousness. Like the Boss, he's drawn to the darkness at the edge of town. On his band's 2004 album, ""Almost Killed Me"" (French Kiss), he observed militiamen cooking up a batch of crystal meth, and growled: ""There's a war going down in the Middle Western states/The Kevlar vests against the crystal flakes."" On this year's ""Separation Sunday"" (French Kiss), he follows characters with code names like Charlemagne and Casanova as their lives blur from kissing and coke to Born Again reminiscence. In the blush of youth, Mr. Finn's twisted but optimistic hood-rat chick tells him: ""I ain't gonna do anything sexual with you/I'm kinda saving myself for the scene."" But as Catholics like Mr. Finn might say, we start out with original sin - and there's lots more where that came from.
