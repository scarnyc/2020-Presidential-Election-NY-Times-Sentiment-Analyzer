7," A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.    Opera    ''EUGENE ONEGIN.'' The work of Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra can be frustratingly uneven. But as the Kirov Opera's three-week residency at the Metropolitan Opera House, part of the Lincoln Center Festival, has proven so far, Mr. Gergiev and his company bring matchless authority to the Russian operatic repertory. Tomorrow night they offer the first of four festival performances of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' which may be the Russian opera best known in the West. Still it should be fascinating to experience the Kirov's production, which stars the baritone Vladimir Moroz in the title role, the tenor Yevgeny Akimov as Lenski and the soprano Irina Mataeva as Tatiana. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $150 (Anthony Tommasini).",https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/18/movies/classical-music-and-dance-guide.html,,"A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.",The New York Times,[],[],2003-07-18T05:00:00+0000,article,"Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk",Movies,,Schedule,nyt://article/75482869-3deb-5d1a-9e2d-aadca560aee0,4076,nyt://article/75482869-3deb-5d1a-9e2d-aadca560aee0,CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE,,,CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE,,,,,[],,E,4
