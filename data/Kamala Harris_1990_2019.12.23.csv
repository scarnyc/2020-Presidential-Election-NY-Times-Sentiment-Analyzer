0,"Michael Kalesniko's acerbic comedy is a Hollywood rarity, a movie about an icy grown-up heart-warmed by a child that doesn't wield emotional pliers to try to squeeze out tears. That frosty heart belongs to Peter McGowan (Kenneth Branagh), a whiny, cynical British-American playwright, nicknamed America's Favorite Bastard, who lives comfortably in a Los Angeles suburb with his wife, Melanie (Robin Wright Penn). The child, Amy Walsh (Suzi Hofrichter), is an 8-year-old who moves in next door with her mother, Trina (Lucinda Jenney), and their very noisy dog, Baby. &quot;How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog&quot; reminds us that when it comes to comedy, it's  all in the writing.
