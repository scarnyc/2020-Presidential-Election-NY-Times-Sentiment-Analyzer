(Photo: Justin Sullivan/Associated Press))   Updated, 7:19 PM  More than a week ago, a computer technician decided to take out his frustrations on his employer, the city of San Francisco. Terry Childs's alleged handiwork, as officials soon found out, was disturbing.   Using his digital keys to the kingdom, he locked out everyone else at an administrative level from a network holding e-mails, city payroll files, confidential law enforcement documents and jail inmates' bookings, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. Tracing the deed to the saboteur proved to be relatively easy. Getting him to reveal the passwords to reverse his digital spell proved far more difficult.   Until Gavin Newsom, the city's popular and telegenic mayor, entered the fray, that is. On Monday, Mr. Newsom came face to face with the rogue programmer, 43, following his arrest on four felony counts of computer tampering.   If only The Chronicle could sell this news to Hollywood:   The San Francisco computer engineer accused of withholding access codes to the city's network surrendered the password during an unusual jailhouse visit by Mayor Gavin Newsom, authorities said Tuesday.  [...] Childs' defense attorney Erin Crane contacted the mayor's office, setting in motion the secret visit.  The visit was so secret that the mayor did not tell District Attorney Kamala Harris' office or police about it. Newsom decided on his own to accept Crane's invitation, mayoral spokesman Nathan Ballard said.  Wired's Threat Level blog reported more details on the second half of the story, when the nine-day-long episode ended:   ""We were able to regain complete control of the network Tuesday,"" said Ron Vinson, the deputy director of the city's Department of Technology Information Services.  [...] ""The mayor showed up unexpectedly at the data center and provided the engineers and forensic experts on the case on site with the passcodes that Mr. Childs had provided the mayor,"" Vinson said.  What precisely happened when the mayor walked into that jail? There were precious few details so far about their 15 minutes together, even though the Chronicle hinted that Mayor Newsom might have built trust with a widely quoted remark that Mr. Childs was clearly ""very good at what he did"" as the city struggled to fix the problem.  As the imagination stirs about high-stakes deals behind closed doors -- and maybe even a little danger for the city's leader -- Nathan Ballard, the mayor's spokesman, played down the superhero angle just a bit.   ""Childs is not a Boy Scout,"" he said, according to the Chronicle. But ""he's not Al Capone either.""  Update, 7:19 PM In response to statements from authorities, Mr. Childs's lawyer contends that his client has done nothing wrong, and was acting in the best interests of the city. ""This was not a danger to the public,"" the lawyer told The Chronicle. Certainly, many things remain unanswered in this case, as one commenter thoughtfully outlined.
