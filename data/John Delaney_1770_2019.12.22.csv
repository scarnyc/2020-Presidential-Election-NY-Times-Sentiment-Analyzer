Well, so here it is, and alas, they weren't kidding. This splendid female vocal quartet has been a mainstay of the early-music scene for 18 years, but it has announced that it will disband at the end of the season. Here it makes its final New York appearance, singing works of Hildegard of Bingen. It is surely going out at the top of its game, with its latest album, ''American Angels,'' near the top of the Billboard classical chart (and another recording still to be released by Harmonia Mundi France). A champagne reception follows the concert. Sunday at 7 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266. Sold out (James R.
