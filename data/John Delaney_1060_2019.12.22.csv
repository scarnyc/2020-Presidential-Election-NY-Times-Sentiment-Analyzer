Less than stellar reviews.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/blogs/16bits-cisco-pr3905.html,"As it launched a new blade server, Cisco went wild with its TelePresence video conferencing technology. The verdict? Less than stellar reviews.","  Someone call the folks at Guinness World Records. Cisco Systems may have broken the record for simultaneous video conferences.   On Monday, Cisco held a video conference for the ages as it announced a new server product in 14 different locations around the globe. John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, directed the affair from the company's headquarters in San Jose, Calif., while other people tuned in from San Francisco, Boston, London and elsewhere. Cisco hoped the virtual gig would showcase both the powers of its new servers and its TelePresence video conferencing technology, but it seemed like the company may have left cynical reporters with an unintended impression.   ""This is like being in North Korea,"" remarked one prominent business reporter.  The TelePresence session did, in fact, carry a scripted feel.   For one, reporters were invited to Cisco's headquarters only to find themselves trapped in a room one floor below Mr. Chambers and other executives, which sort of defeats the purpose of a live news conference. That said, the technology linking the two rooms worked great. So I'm prepared to say Cisco has solved inter-office networking challenges.   Secondly, Cisco held reporters hostage as it went from executive-to-executive and partner-to-partner over the course of almost two hours. On screen we saw Paul Otellini, the chief executive at Intel; Joe Tucci, the chief executive at EMC; Paul Maritz, the chief executive at VMware; Bob Beauchamp, the chief executive at BMC; Pat Gelsinger, the head of Intel's server business; Bob Muglia, the president of Microsoft's server business; and Bill Green, the chief executive of Accenture. And that's just to name a few.   Most of these executives handled the video conference well, although a couple of people were caught off guard by the technology.   Cisco divided its huge screens into three sections with Mr. Chambers always sitting in the middle and the other executives appearing on either side of him when it was their turn to speak. From time-to-time, however, Cisco would leave some executives on the side screens for long periods after their speeches had finished, and they didn't seem to know that.   Mr. Tucci, for example, sat fiddling with a pen for a few minutes, rolling it around in his hands and scribbling on a water bottle as other executives talked. He chatted with people in the Boston room and moved his chair around for the best spot in front of the camera -- also known as ""telepreening.""   After the executives finally finished speaking, Cisco opened up the event to a question and answer session, but even that felt scripted. Cisco controlled who could ask questions, giving people one shot and then muting their lines before any follow-ups could occur.   It hand-picked the questioners, settling at one point on Vernon Turner, an analyst with IDC. Mr. Turner's query elicited some chuckles from the San Jose room filled with reporters, as he seemed very on message. He complimented Cisco for shipping ""a system"" (rather than a mere product) and then asked Mr. Chambers to expound on his views about technology.   Mr. Chambers stressed Cisco's commitment to this type of collaboration technology again and again.   ""This is how I live my life,"" he said. ""I do this four or five times a day.""  To his credit, Mr. Chambers did make his way down the stairs after the TelePresence bit concluded to chat with the reporters for a few minutes. Ever the Southern gentleman, he asked how we liked the session, and none of the grumbling reporters – yours truly included – had the courage to tell him in person how we really felt.   Bless the creation of the blog. Cough.   As usual, Mr. Chambers vowed to keep making acquisitions, particularly in the data center market as it looks to take on I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Dell with its new blade servers. When possible, Cisco prefers to pick up private companies flagged as important by customers, Mr. Chambers said.   Although, given that BMC's software sits at the heart of Cisco's server, analysts have said it may be first on Cisco's shopping list.   ""BMC makes the whole thing work,"" said Ken Dulaney, an analyst with Gartner. ""That is the part they need to own.""  Mr. Chambers tried to play down the competitive threat posed by the new product, saying Cisco is open to partnering with I.B.M., which could move Cisco's gear via its services arm. ""I think you will see us work with I.B.M., and we'll see how that plays out,"" he said.   H.P. received less favorable treatment.   ""H.P. will primarily be a competitor,"" Mr. Chambers said.   I guess that means no Christmas card for E.D.S. this year.
