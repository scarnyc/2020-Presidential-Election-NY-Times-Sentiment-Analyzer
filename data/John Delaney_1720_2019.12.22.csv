JOEY BARON'S KILLER JOEY, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Baron, the drummer, started out in straight-ahead jazz, playing behind Carmen McRae, among others, then became closely associated with everything downtown and post-jazz as a member of various John Zorn groups and the quartet Masada. He has kept his own groups as sideline activities, and they're restless, brainy fun. Killer Joey includes the guitarists Steve Cardenas and Brad Shepik, and the bassist Tony Scherr. Tonight through Sunday night at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tomorrow; cover charge is $30 (Ben Ratliff).",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-611131.html,"A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

8,"In the summer of 1970, a pair of Canadian rock promoters, Ken Walker and Thor Eaton, assembled an amazing list of performers for a five-day tour that would begin with a concert in Toronto and then travel by train to Winnipeg and Calgary.  The talent included Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, the Band and &#151; for the same now-mysterious reasons they turned up in Woodstock &#151; the oldies band Sha-Na-Na.   But because of a fight between the festival promoters and the producers of the movie, the footage was never edited and never seen.  It has now been reclaimed and cut into dynamic form by the music documentary specialist Bob Smeaton (&quot;The Genesis Songbook&quot;).   What Mr. Smeaton has created is, in effect, a brand new film from 1970.  Respecting the cinema-vérité style and technical limitations of the time (the grainy 16-millimeter film stock looks wonderfully like grainy 16-millimeter film stock), &quot;Festival Express&quot; seems to step directly out of its period, and is guaranteed to thrill both survivors of those times and younger viewers who may know little of them. &#151; Dave Kehr",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/movies/film-review-a-legendary-train-ride-through-rock-s-fabled-past.html,"In the summer of 1970, a pair of Canadian rock promoters, Ken Walker and Thor Eaton, assembled an amazing list of performers for a five-day tour that would begin with a concert in Toronto and then travel by train to Winnipeg and Calgary.

In the Blasters, in X and now on his own, Mr. Alvin has written and sung about outcasts, lovers and criminals, some of the people who share the road with an itinerant musician. He sets his narratives in country and rockabilly tunes that aim for classic American simplicity, though his words detail an uncertain moral landscape. Rockabilly, surf music and other rowdy, twang-heavy styles are the specialty of Los Straitjackets, who often wear Mexican wrestling masks as they play their instrumentals.
