2,At least a dozen were also injured when a van plowed into a crowd.,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/blogs/22cityroom-child-is6195.html,At least a dozen were also injured when a van plowed into a crowd.,"(Photo: Police investigated on Thursday after a delivery van hit a crowd of people, including a group of preschoolers, on a busy commercial street in Chinatown. (Photo: John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times))   Updated, 11:21 p.m. &#124; An unoccupied delivery van that had been left in reverse backed into a crowd of people, including a group of preschoolers, on a busy commercial street in Chinatown on Thursday morning, killing two small children and injuring a dozen other people, the authorities said. (Please read the updated article from Friday's print edition.)  The accident occurred at 11:31 a.m. outside the Wing Hing Center, a commercial building at 39 East Broadway, between Market and Catherine Streets.   The authorities said that a 4-year-old girl, Hayley Ng of the Lower East Side, was killed almost immediately. She was pronounced dead at the scene.   Two other children, a 3-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, were critically injured and taken to New York Downtown Hospital. There, about an hour later, the boy, identified as Diego Martinez, of Chelsea, died.   ""Despite heroic efforts of our emergency-room staff, the child was pronounced dead,"" at 12:33 p.m., said Dr. Warren B. Licht, the hospital's chief medical officer. ""Everything possible was tried to save this child's life.""   Eleven other people, both children and adults, sustained minor injuries. Some were taken to New York Downtown Hospital, and others to Bellevue Hospital Center.   When the accident occurred, around 14 children were being led in a ""daisy chain"" line -- holding onto each other and accompanied by adult chaperons -- along East Broadway from a library visit back to their day care program, the Red Apple Child Development Center, at 25 Market Street, the police said.   The van, a 2000 Ford, was traveling on East Broadway and appeared to make a three-point turn to make a delivery. Shortly after -- witnesses at times gave conflicting accounts -- the van lurched, going in reverse over the curb and onto the sidewalk, according to witnesses.  Early in the day, the police had said that before the accident the van had stopped and the driver had gotten out, and that the vehicle then began to move, without anyone behind the wheel. The police later appeared to retract that account, but by Thursday evening the authorities were again saying that the driver, Chao Fu, 52, had double-parked and entered a store, leaving the van running and in reverse gear, thinking it was in park. Mr. Fu was not charged.   Alma Torres, 49, who was standing across the street from the scene of the accident, said of the driver: ""He backed up. He jumped the curb. You heard the bang. People started running."" Ms. Torres said she later saw a Chinese woman, distraught and screaming.   Anthony Amoroso, 50, who lives in East New York, Brooklyn, said of the driver: ""He was making a three-point turn. He backed up onto the sidewalk."" All he heard after that, Mr. Amoroso, was ""the screaming.""  Another man, Kenneth Martin, 41, of Bushwick, Brooklyn, saw the aftermath of the accident and described seeing a girl being placed in an ambulance. ""She was scared,"" Mr. Martin said. ""Her arms were lifted up.""   Pamela Leitstein, 48, who is also from East New York, said: ""It was chaos."" Katharine Montaldo, 39, from the East Village, said: ""I heard screaming. I came running up. All I saw was blood.""   Police officials said the driver of the truck did not leave the scene of the accident. Witnesses gave varying accounts of the driver's actions after the crash: one said he left the van as if in a state of shock, while another witness that police officers removed the driver from the van.   A silver-gray van with the name of a company, China Chalet, emblazoned on its side was sitting on the sidewalk along the east side of East Broadway on Thursday afternoon.   On the sidewalk, directly behind the van and in front of the building, the police placed cloth sheets across the sidewalk. The sheets were stained with blood; at moments, the wind briefly blew off one of the sheet, revealing the crumpled body of a small child, wearing gray pants.   A woman who answered the phone Thursday afternoon at China Chalet's office, at 47 Broadway, declined to confirm that its truck was involved in the accident, but said in Chinese that ""something happened."" The woman said the company's owner was not available for comment, and then hung up.   The block of East Broadway where the accident occurred is a crowded commercial corridor, filled with restaurants and food shops at the base of tenement buildings.  At 33 East Broadway, a few doors down from the scene of the accident, is the historic Chatham Square Branch of the New York Public Library. The branch opened in 1903 and was designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White.   The Red Apple Child Development Center, where the children were enrolled, has two licenses, one for infants and toddlers and one for children 2 to 6 years, according to the Bureau of Child Care at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.   A woman who answered the phone at the child care center on Thursday afternoon said that the situation was unclear. She said in Chinese, ""We don't have any information right now.""  At about 2 p.m., a grief-stricken man and woman clutching each other were quickly escorted out of the child-care center by police and into a waiting police van, which sped down the street, sirens blaring. The man and woman did not answer questions from reporters.   Later on Thursday afternoon, Xiaoping Fan, director of the day-care center, said in a statement released by its lawyer, Robert S. Wolf:     All of us at Red Apple Child Development Center are stunned and deeply saddened by this tragic accident. Our hearts go out to the families of all of the children involved and especially to the two families who suffered the loss of their child. We are doing everything possible to provide support to our students, parents, and their loved ones.    The Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, who went to the scene of the accident, said in a statement afterward that the accident pointed up the need to better protect pedestrians. Mr. Stringer said:   The Zip code in which 38 East Broadway is located had 25 fatalities and 1,149 injuries from 1995 to 2005, more fatalities than any other Manhattan zip code. And the intersection of Essex and Delancey Streets, located just a few blocks from where today's accident occurred, is the third most dangerous location for Manhattan pedestrians. While the city has taken some important steps to manage traffic in Chinatown, including bollards, better lane designations, and other ""traffic calming"" measures, it is clear that more needs to be done, particularly given the congestion created by the continued closing of Park Row, which has been shut to most traffic since 9/11.  In New York City overall last year some 300 people were killed in traffic accidents -- nearly one person every day -- and hundreds more were injured, with children and the elderly being particularly vulnerable on our congested streets. The city must take a systematic look in every neighborhood at measures like sidewalk bollards and speed bumps, as well as strict traffic enforcement, to make it safer for New Yorkers to walk the streets of their city.
