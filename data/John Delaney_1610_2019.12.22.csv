Theater    Previews and Openings    'SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL'  Opens Tuesday. This well-financed showcase of new works generated much buzz last year; now it returns for a second year with eye-catching titles like ''The Adventures of Barrio Grrrl!'' (2:00) and ''How Love Is Spelt'' (1:45). Theater Row Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.    'ICE FACTORY 2005'  Opens Wednesday. The annual and well-regarded collection of new work features plays by such emerging companies as Witness Relocation Company and Favored National Theater.

'WALK TWO MOONS' Previews start Thursday. Opens July 13. Theaterworks/NYC inaugurates their new home with Julia Jordan's family-friendly adaptation of Sharon Creech's novel about a girl and her grandparents (1:10). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)     'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'  (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)     *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)     'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS'  Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the genocide of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)     * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)     'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)      'BIRDIE BLUE'  The stern competence of Lieutenant Van Buren, the formidable figure played by S. Epatha Merkerson on ""Law & Order,"" is a long way from the warm but addled Birdie Blue, the title character in the new play by Cheryl L. West at the Second Stage Theater. The gifted Ms. Merkerson has no trouble bridging that emotional distance, but there's little she can do to patch the dramatic holes in Ms. West's fragmentary, seriously unsatisfactory play (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)     * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)     'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' When the eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent trial of the century -- the first of many in the 20th -- was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' recounts the sensational events with nuance and admirable research, but the passionless production unfortunately has the whiff of the whiff of Masterpiece Theater (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.(Zinoman)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)     'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Éloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Van Gelder)      *'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Can man-shark love survive in the post- ''Jaws'' era? Adam Bock's screwy, perfectly cast play poses this and other questions you didn't know needed asking, in hilarious fashion (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422. ( Genzlinger)     'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20).

(Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15).

(Zinoman)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG TIMES' Did you hear the one about the three actresses who wrote themselves a play? The punchline is this sweet, slender homage to the glory days of vaudeville, complete with goofy jokes, gags and good music by the Moonlighters: kids are as likely to enjoy it as adults. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)      'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10).

Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)     'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' The debate about evoking the proper measurements of humor and pathos in the plays of Anton Chekhov is settled evenly if dubiously in Scott Zigler's production for the Atlantic Theater Company: it fails more or less equally at eliciting laughter and tears (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)     *'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film ''Bamboozled.'' This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like ''Frankenstein'' and ''King Kong'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)     *'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, garment district, (212)307-4100, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE' This unrewarding Athol Fugard play benefits from some rewarding performances by its four actors.

(Genzlinger)     * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Alan Ayckbourn's 67th play, a minor-key comedy about six Londoners leading lives of quiet desperation, is rueful, funny, touching and altogether wonderful. Sir Alan's flawless cast amplifies the emotional impact of his writing in variously subtle and hilarious ways, while respecting the depth in his literary spareness (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45).

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)    *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)    'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director Nora Ephron forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH'  (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)    'DALLAS 362' (R, 100 minutes) The directorial debut of Scott Caan, the 28-year-old son of the actor James Caan, ''Dallas 362'' tracks the troubled friendship between Rusty (Shawn Hatosy) and Dallas (Mr. Caan), two boys just out of their teens whose lives have become stalled in an endless cycle of drinking, bar brawls and minor arrests. ''It's a whole thing'' is this film's catchphrase, a line the two boys use to gesture inarticulately toward the complexity of any subject they can't understand. Scott Caan's debut film is not quite yet a whole thing, but it offers up enough interesting fragments to make his sophomore effort worth watching for. (Stevens)    'A DECENT FACTORY' (No rating, 79 minutes, in English, Finnish and Chinese) A cursory, irritatingly facile look at the human cost of globalization, this documentary film was shot and directed by a Frenchman, Thomas Balmès, who tagged along with representatives of the Finnish cellphone giant Nokia on a trip to one of the company's suppliers in China. (Dargis)    *'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM'  (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    '5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)    *'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)    'HEIGHTS' (R, 93 minutes) In its aspirations, design and worldview, ''Heights'' resembles a number of other films about cozily connected souls, a soap-operatic subgenre that might be called We Are the World. Everybody hurts, as Michael Stipe likes to sing, but people in ''Heights'' seem to hurt more or at least spend a lot of time nursing that hurt in brooding silence and noisy confrontation. (Dargis)    'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be THIS silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    *'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER'  (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)     'LADIES IN LAVENDER'  (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'LILA SAYS' (No rating, 89 minutes, in French) Ziad Douieri's film, about a 16-year-old French girl's provocative verbal seduction of a 19-year-old Arab boy takes the raw material of social realist melodrama and turns it into a sad and sexy pop song. (Scott)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) The sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions.(Holden)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)     'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring (Scott)    'SEX, POLITICS AND COCKTAILS' (No rating, 90 minutes) In this debut feature written, directed and edited by Julien Hernandez , Sebastian Cortez (played by Mr. Hernandez) is a 31-year-old Cuban-American filmmaker finds work making a series of documentaries bout gay culture, Sebastian asks his friend Daria (Marisa Petroro), a soap-opera actress, to introduce him to her circle of gay friends, a raucous group given to margarita-swilling and trading raunchy stories. The common theme of these scattered vignettes seems to be that, straight or gay, it's tough to find love and commitment in a world filled with venal, grasping nitwits. (Stevens)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)    *'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    *'TROPICAL MALADY' (No rating, 118 minutes, in Thai) Perched between two worlds, two consciousnesses and two radically different storytelling traditions, this Thai feature shows the young filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul pushing at the limits of cinematic narrative with grace and a certain amount of puckish willfulness. (Dargis)    'TWIST OF FAITH' (No rating, 87 minutes) Another demoralizing documentary about sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church (it was broadcast on HBO last week). As in so many cases in which priests have been accused of abuse, the details of the alleged crimes are maddeningly elusive. The documentary is an unhappy one, with no satisfying resolution. (Virginia Heffernan)     *'THE WHITE DIAMOND' (No rating, 90 minutes) Werner Herzog, in the jungles of Guyana, observes a small airship and its crew. This documentary is a record of his impressions and discoveries, and an essay on the complexities of nature in its wild and human varieties. It is an unassuming film, but nonetheless full of scenes and images that can only be described as sublime.

Followup albums showed she wasn't just a PJ Harvey copycat, but radio had moved on. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236, $10.

Two tickets per person distributed at 5 p.m. on the day of the show. (Sinagra)    KEVIN DEVINE (Tonight) This singer-songwriter has been the opening act of choice for brainy acts from Liz Phair to Bright Eyes.

But now that the Roots and others have reclaimed ground for bohemian types, they've decided to revive their sassy, spacey poetry. The witty former teacher J Live opens. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $27.50, $30 at the door. (Sinagra)    EARTH, WIND & FIRE, CHICAGO (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) During the 1970's, Earth Wind and Fire was the glossy, horn-powered hit machine that covered all bases, from idealism (''Shining Star'') to dance tunes (''Boogie Wonderland'') to lover's pleas (''Reasons''). Rarely has a band so rapidly dumped its initial radicalism as the radio hit-maker Chicago, which held on to its horn section but traded early jazz-rock experiments for simpering pop.

(Sinagra)    JOHN HAMMOND (Thursday) The rural blues tradition of polyrhythmic fingerpicking and casually revealing vocals is being upheld by revivalists like John Hammond, who has been playing country blues since the 1960's, is a virtuoso whose songs, mostly classic blues, are feats of down-home intricacy. 7 p.m., Robert F Wagner Jr. Park, Battery Park City, free. (Pareles)    ILL EASE (Tomorrow) The low-key Elizabeth Sharp tops her rattletrap drum grooves with whispery, intentionally in-the-cracks singing that mimics the loop of a grudge mantra in a jealous brain.

Wanda Jackson, from Oklahoma, was out on the road too, belting songs like ''Fujiyama Mama'' (a big hit in Japan) and ''Mean Mean Man.'' In the 1970's, she became a Christian and turned to church music.

(Anderson)    SITELINES: TOM PEARSON (Opens Thursday) ''Reel'' choreographically uses the rotunda of a former United States Customs House to comment on themes of dominance and reconciliation. Thursday at 2 and 6:30 p.m., July 8 and 9 at 2 p.m., Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, free. (Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums     *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,'  through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)    *BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs, by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. (See above.)(Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,'  through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    *EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,'  through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher, and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter).     *GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,'  through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)    *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA: The Daguerreotypes of Southworth and Hawes,'' International Center of Photography through Sept. 4. The Dauguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,'  through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)    MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE,' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,'  through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART:'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION Despite a fairly inchoate assemblage of contemporary art on the second floor, the early story of modernism is now retold in an installation about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)       UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with, scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavanger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 60's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    'JOAN MITCHELL SKETCHBOOK: 1949-51' The 60 pages from a single notebook document an eventful period in this American painter's life, years that saw her moving between New York and Paris, and changing from a figurative to an abstract painter, consolidating a connection to French modernism, particularly to Cézanne and early Mondrian; and absorbing the spirit of the New York painters she felt closest to, Willem De Kooning, Arshile Gorky. Francis M. Naumann, 22 East 80th Street, Upper East Side, (212)472-6800 (Through July 15) (Cotter)    Galleries: 57th Street    RALPH BACERRA: 'OPULENT FIRE' Beautiful and technically awe-inspiring new teapots by this Los Angeles-based ceramicist have organically shaped, multi-part bodies cast from tree branches and surfaces richly glazed in fine geometric patterns. Garth Clark, 25 West 56th Street, (due to renovations of the main lobby), (212)246-2205, through Aug. 12.(Johnson)     'GEE'S BEND QUILTS' Quilt's made by women of the tiny hamlet of Gee's Bend, Ala., have been making the rounds of United States museums since 2002. For those who are still unacquainted with those extraordinary works of folk art that resonate strikingly with Modernist abstraction, this small show is a good introduction. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through July 22.(Johnson)    'OK/OKAY' This entertaining two-gallery exhibition introduces 14 European artists whose works in nontraditional media tend to read like overproduced one-liners. Swiss Institute , 495 Broadway, (212)925-2035; and Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212)998-6780, through July 16. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN'  Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing, but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through July 22. (Johnson)    'HOMOMUSEUM: HEROES AND MONUMENTS' With multiculturalist monuments to all kinds of minorities in place, how about a National Gay Hall of Fame, celebrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered culture? This group show of 27 artists could have been sharper and more exploratory than it is, but has good work and packs a lot of history. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 30. (Cotter)    'MONOCHROME IMAGE' This show of single-color works in two and three dimensions include a man's suit, hat and shoes cast in pink rubber by David Baskin; a life-size giant squid of yellow crocheted yarn by Mary Carlson; an orange sculpture resembling a big clown's smile by John Monti; and a yellow wooden relief like a section of wainscoting by Francis Cape. Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212)463-9666, through July 22. (Johnson)    KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    *MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    ALLAN DESOUZA: 'THE LOST PICTURES'  New pictures by this conceptualist photographer meditate on the photograph as a memorial object. Mr. deSouza placed prints made from old family slides around hishome, allowing them to become faded and abraded and to accumulate hair, dust and other debris. He then turned them into large, glossy digital prints in which the ghosts of the original images haunt the new, busily textured, semi-abstract surfaces. Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, Union Square, (212) 673-3096, through July 15. (Johnson)    DANA FRANKFORT: WHAT'S SO FUNNY In her debut exhibition, this young painter tries to add her own twist to the long tradition of language-based painting by inserting familiar words and phrases into fields of bright, shiny monochrome color. ''Yes,'' ''Now'' and ''Halleluiah,'' spelled in blocky letters that fill the canvases, glide in and out of view, like towering neon signs seen through radiant fog Brooklyn Fire Proof, 101 Richardson Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)302-4702, through July 10. (Smith)     MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 14. (Johnson)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    ARTHUR SIMMS A selection of works dating from 1989 to the present by a sculptor who uses rope, wire and junky found materials to create assemblages of uncommon formal and poetic power. Five Myles, 558 St. Johns Place, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, (718)783-4438, through July 10. (Johnson)    'WOODS' Works made of and about wood and trees include miniature firs in Styrofoam planters by Carin Mincemoyer; conflations of Minimalist form and furniture-making craft by Richard Bottwin; a walk-in spiral maze by Leo Berk; Caitlin Bermingham's oddly creepy fake plants; Eric Kidhart's faux-populist illustrations made using woodburning tools; and Justin Witte's white-on-white cartoon visions of bizarre woodland activities. D.u.m.b.o. Art Center, 30 Washington Street, Brooklyn, (718)694-0831, through July 10. (Johnson)    Last Chance    CHAN CHAO: 'ECHO' Tension between the clinical and the voyeuristic animates high-definition portraits of attractive nude woman by a photographer known for portraits of young Burmese rebel soldiers. Yancy Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    MARY ANN CURRIER With a satiny, soft-edged touch and an intense attention to texture, light and detail, this 78-year-old Louisville, Ky.-based painter gives dying roses a vivid and slightly weird tangibility. Gerald Peters, 24 East 78th Street, (212)628-9760, closing today.(Johnson)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, closing today. (Smith)    JAUNE QUICK-TO-SEE-SMITH: 'CONNECTIONS' Ms. Quick-to-See-Smith is widely known for blending Modernist style, Native American themes and symbols and politics. The most impressive work in this selection of recent and older works is a protest against war: a cartoonish, brusquely painted, mural-scale picture of a canoe loaded with infernal images from Indian, Mexican and Medieval European cultures as well as figures from Picasso's ''Guernica.'' Flomenhaft, 547 West 27th Street, (212)268-4952, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    THOMAS SCHÜTTE: 'ONE MAN HOUSES'  Models of small, modernistic houses meant to be built full-size by collectors, who buy them and furniture made from hollow-core doors, reflect on design and consumerism but with less formal interest and conceptual wit than do the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    'SURFACE' This engaging exhibition presents paintings and drawings that possess notable surface qualities ranging from glossy to crusty as well as Pop Art tendencies. Participants include Aaron Parazette, Torben Giehler, John Wesley, Chris Kysor, Andrew Masullo and more than 25 others. Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, closing today.(Johnson)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI, 'AFRO-MUSES,' closing on Sunday. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500.

Previews and Openings    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Opens tomorrow. The Aquila Theater presents Shakespeare's comedy about mistaken identities, unrequited love and the threats of a puritanical zealot (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200.    'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Opens Tuesday. Edward Albee covered man-goat love.

Up-and-comer Lynn Collins, who was Portia in the recent film of ''The Merchant of Venice,'' plays one of Shakespeare's most beloved heroines, Rosalind, in Mark Lamos's production in Shakespeare in the Park. Brian Bedford and Richard Thomas star (2:40). Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. Entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West and at 79th Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)539-8750.    Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' The debate about evoking the proper measurements of humor and pathos in the plays of Anton Chekhov is settled evenly if dubiously in Scott Zigler's production for the Atlantic Theater Company: It fails more or less equally at eliciting laughter and tears (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, garment district, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' When the eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent trial of the century -- the first of many in the 20th -- was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' recounts the sensational events with nuance and admirable research, but the passionless production unfortunately has the whiff of the whiff of Masterpiece Theater (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.( Zinoman)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)    'PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE' This unrewarding Athol Fugard play benefits from some rewarding performances by its four actors. O'Mara Leary is Milly, who on her 50th birthday has been dumped by her boyfriend, and tries to keep her spirits up by recruiting some pals to join her in what turns out to be the worst birthday party ever (1:30). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.( Genzlinger)    * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Alan Ayckbourn's 67th play, a minor-key comedy about six Londoners leading lives of quiet desperation, is rueful, funny, touching and altogether wonderful. Sir Alan's flawless cast amplifies the emotional impact of his writing in variously subtle and hilarious ways, while respecting the depth in his literary spareness (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    'UNSUSPECTING SUSAN' Celia Imrie stars as a snobbish Englishwoman in this funny, engaging (mostly) and tragic one-woman show written by Stewart Permutt. Ms. Imrie's character frets about her troubled son, living in London with a charming man, but doesn't begin to grasp how worried she should really be (1:10). Part of Brits Off Broadway. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. ( Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG TIMES' Did you hear the one about the three actresses who wrote themselves a play? The punchline is this sweet, slender homage to the glory days of vaudeville, complete with goofy jokes, gags, and good music by the Moonlighters: kids are as likely to enjoy it as adults. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    * 'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film ''Bamboozled.'' This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like ''Frankenstein'' and ''King Kong'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444.( Zinoman)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10).

( Isherwood)    'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'HECUBA' Revenge is a dish served at room temperature in the intelligent but passionless production starring Vanessa Redgrave. Ms. Redgrave intriguingly brings forth the cool strategist inside the battered woman. But if we can admire this abject figure's salvaged aplomb, we rarely get a visceral sense of the despair and the rage at injustice that make the character such a compelling one (1:45). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, (718)636-4100, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'JACKSON'S WAY' Thirty-one-year-old Will Adamsdale isn't so much a comedian as a veritable wizard; a virtuoso of the transcendently absurd. Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, he spins a wacky world of increasingly bizarre nonsense out of thin air, creating an exquisitely idiosyncratic worldview that is as funny as it is wonderfully weird, all in the guise of being a life coach named Chris John Jackson, inventor of the motivational technique (1:15).

Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'MARK TWAIN TONIGHT!' In a role he has been playing over half a century, Hal Holbrook delivers a performance that is perhaps most remarkable for the energy it derives from a studied languor. Mr. Holbrook's Twain is an exhilarating master of theatrical passive aggression, while Twain's observations about corrupt journalists, politicians and religious fanatics remain soberingly relevant (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday.

Along with Mr. Foote's chilling drama is Craig Lucas's shrewd portrait of a troubled woman, ''Your Call is Important,'' which plays on, among other things, New Yorker's neurosis about country life, and two minor pieces by Kate Long and Romulus Linney (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101), closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'SENECA'S OEDIPUS' In the new production of Seneca's ''Oedipus'' by the Theater by the Blind, the iconic story of the king of Thebes who unknowingly murders his father and marries his mother is performed in modern dress.

(Honor Moore)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that ultimately pays off with some great laughs. This 1773 comedy mocks the London upper class's snobbery, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.(Brantley)    'THE WHORE OF SHERIDAN SQUARE' Michael Baron has written and directed this merry tribute to Charles Ludlam, who died of AIDS at 44, cutting short one of the most influential careers in downtown theater. For many downtown theatergoers, this silly -- or should I say, ridiculous -- dramatization of the life of Ludlam will be a nostalgic kick, like bumping into an old friend who you haven't seen in a long time (1:50).

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)    * 'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    '5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)    'HEIGHTS' (R, 93 minutes) In its aspirations, design and worldview, ''Heights'' resembles a number of other films about cozily connected souls, a soap-operatic subgenre that might be called We Are the World. Everybody hurts, as Michael Stipe likes to sing, but people in ''Heights'' seem to hurt more or at least spend a lot of time nursing that hurt in brooding silence and noisy confrontation. (Dargis)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    * 'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) About a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's cleareyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)    * 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WAGING A LIVING' and 'ROSEVELT'S AMERICA' (No rating, 85 and 25 minutes) An eye-opening, often heartbreaking documentary tracking four members of the working poor in the Northeast and California. Roger Weisberg's feature is accompanied by his short film, ''Rosevelt's America,'' a vérité profile of the Liberian refugee Rosevelt Henderson.(Jeannette Catsoulis)    Film Series    HANNA SCHYGULLA (through June 30) The Museum of Modern Art concludes its 11-film retrospective of the work of Ms. Schygulla, the multi-award-winning German actress.

(Laura Sinagra)    ANNIE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Norwegian singer Annie's happy dance pop takes on darker aspects because of associations with the minimalist techno club scene and work with bands like Royksopp and St. Etienne. For these shows, she will DJ with her Finnish producer Timo Kaukolampi. Tuesday at 10 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, Maritime Hotel, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (718)599-3101, $10.

(Sinagra)    ANTIBALAS AND SOULIVE (Tonight) Antibalas delivers a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. Soulive is an organ-guitar-drums trio that harks back to the 1950's and 1960's, playing meaty, blues-centered jazz and funk. Lately, it has been hooking up with a little hip-hop. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation.(Jon Pareles)    ALESSANDRA BELLONI AND BRAZILAIN GUESTS: NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS (Tomorrow) Ms. Belloni, the singer and tambourine player, has spent years researching ancient songs and trance rituals from southern Italy.

(Pareles)    BOUKMAN EKSPERYANS, BOUKAN GINEN (Tonight) A double bill of Haitian rock based on voodoo rhythms. Boukman Eksperyans went to the Haitian countryside to collect the Afro-Haitian rhythms of rural voodoo and carnival music. Then it added electric guitars and lyrics hinting at revolutionary messages, and reshaped a generation of Haitian rock. Boukan Ginen was formed by an ex-member of Boukman Eksperyans. 12 a.m. and 2 a.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20, $22 at the door. (Pareles)    DAVID BYRNE (Wednesday) The stylish, brainy punk rocker and world-music fixture David Byrne has been in danger of slipping into cliché. But at a recent show, Mr. Byrne was a man on fire, shaking and hurling his yelps into the balcony. His latest work features the Texas-based chamber group Tosca Strings, who will appear with him here. 5 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, $37, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)    BILLY CORGAN (Monday and Tuesday) One of the more abrasive alternative rockers of the 90's, Billy Corgan (of Smashing Pumpkins fame) nonetheless penned some of the decade's most triumphant pop complaints. After feigning humility for 2003's Zwan project, he released a book of his poems and recorded a just-released solo album. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)    C-RAYZ WALZ, J LIVE, VAST AIRE (Wednesday) This trio of local rappers share an aesthetic that idealizes the East Coast Golden Age of elite M.C.'s. That is, they pursue nuance over histrionics and hubris. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, $15. (Sinagra)    D'GARY (Tonight) It has been a while since the Malagasy guitarist D'Gary was first hailed as the low-key prodigy from Madagascar's back country whose self-taught style involved exquisitely detailed flourishes over unorthodox rhythms, but his approach remains distinctive. 10 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155, $18, $22 at the door.(Sinagra)    * DR. DOG (Thursday) This emerging Philadelphia band loves breezy vocal harmonies, but the live show is much louder and more exuberant, especially when Scott McMicken unleashes one of his wailing, shape-shifting guitar solos. Opening for Apostle of Hustle. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Kelefa Sanneh)    EISLEY (Tonight) The waifs in this pretty pop quartet are siblings, home schooled in a Texas small-town by Christian parents who supported their daughters' Radiohead obsession. If they seem slight now, just wait. The youngest writes the best stuff, and her round, imploring voice sounds spookily like Christine McVie's. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Sinagra)    EELS (Thursday) There's really only one eel, the prolific confessional indie rocker Mark Everett. His projects include the hip-hop kitsch of ''I Am the Messiah'' (SpinART). His latest work delves into family deaths and trauma, moving from countrified swoon to ironic flail to self-aware, yet nostalgic, regret. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212)840-2824, $24.50 and $29.50.(Sinagra)    FEIST (Tomorrow) A pal and collaborator of the dirty electroclash queen Peaches and part of the Canadian indie collective Broken Social Scene, the warm-voiced Feist brings more of a cabaret swing to her own music. She's good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best songs are quirky, plucked jazz-tinged numbers that make her sound like a hipper Norah Jones. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)    RUTH GERSON (Thursday) With a voice that rises from tender endearments to a bluesy, impassioned growl, Ruth Gerson sings folk-rock songs that reach for the status of anthems. 8 p.m. Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077, $10. (Pareles)    THE GET UP KIDS, FRENCH KICKS (Tonight) The jumping-bean energy of the emo rock stalwarts the Get Up Kids shames anyone not pogo-ing to their earnest beat. The French Kicks have moved from the angular post-punk of their Washington roots to a more wistful new wave sound. 5 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $18, $20 at the door (sold out).(Sinagra)    HAMELL ON TRIAL (Wednesday) A solo performer with the force of a hard-rock band, Ed Hamell quick-strums his acoustic guitar and delivers torrents of words, sometimes funny, sometimes furious. 9:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $12. (Pareles)    JOHN HIATT, THE NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tomorrow) Mr. Hiatt's songs get to the heart of human frailty, loyalty and love, even if they take a sidelong route. With a deep-diving baritone, a twang-happy band and enough strange facial expressions to rival Jim Carrey, Mr. Hiatt sings his songs as convincingly as anyone around. The jamming Southern rock band North Mississippi All-Stars play an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the Mississippi Delta and the hill country nearby. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door. (Pareles)    HOPEWELL/DOS/THE BLUE VAN (Tomorrow) Hopewell looks back to the majestic side of psychedelia, wafting high tenor vocals over stately songs with wah-wah ripples at the edges. Dos includes Mike Watt, the bassist and singer of the Minutemen and Firehose, and Kira Roessler. See above for the Blue Van. Danko Jones opens. 8:30 p.m. Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Pareles)    DANNY KRIVIT (Sunday) This longtime disco and house D.J. presides over a floating party organized by the 718 Sessions crew. 7 p.m., Circle Line Cruises, Pier 83, 43rd Street, at the West Side Highway, (212)978-8869, $27, $35 at the gate. (Sanneh)    LA LEY (Thursday) La Ley, from Mexico, is a long-running Rock en Español band that's hugely popular south of the border. It's also a painfully earnest band aspiring to be Mexico's answer to U2 or Depeche Mode. This is billed as its final tour. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 Thursday. (Pareles)    TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS, RADIO 4 (Sunday) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and sudden falsetto also recall the melodic 70's arena-rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. Radio 4 plays steadily improving post-punk. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800. $15.(Sinagra)    * ELLA LEYA (Tomorrow) Born in Azerbaijan and celebrated as a jazz singer in what was the Soviet Union, Ella Leya rediscovered the melancholy songs called Russian romances after she emigrated to the United States. On her album ''Russian Romance'' (B-Elite), she sings them with a tenderly mournful voice, in exquisite arrangements that merge chamber music, Russian and Central Asian touches. 7:30 p.m. Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200, $25. (Pareles)    LEZ ZEPPELIN, (Wednesday) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy. Of course, they also have their gender-bending way with macho metaphors about squeezed lemons and dripping honey. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)    LHASA (Thursday) Lhasa sings in Spanish, French and English, with a husky, torchy voice that fills her music with the smoldering drama of Mexican boleros and French chansons. 8 p.m. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $20, $25 at the door. (Pareles)    THE LITTLE KILLERS, CHEATER SLICKS (Thursday) This garage-rock showcase stars the local trio the Little Killers and Cheater Slicks, a veteran band that finds ways to combine exuberance with meanness. 9 p.m., Sin-é, 148-150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077, $10. (Sanneh)    * THE LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) The Long Blondes, a three-woman, two-man band from England, hark back to the sparse, scrabbling late-1970's post-punk of the Slits and Delta Five on the handful of songs they have released, including the eager ''Giddy Stratospheres'' (What's Your Rupture), which takes some unexpected turns. 11 p.m., TriBeCa Grand, 2 Avenue of the Americas, at Church Street, (212) 519-6677; free with RSVP to getrad@igetrvng.com. (Pareles)    LONGWAVE (Wednesday) Longwave ponders self-destruction and transcendence in brooding songs with guitar lines that coil and climb. With Benzos opening. 8 p.m. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Pareles)    LYNYRD SKYNYRD (Sunday) Their funky Southern hard rock made them one of the best bands of the 70's, and the plane crash that killed the singer Ronnie Van Zant and others made Skynyrd's story the most horrific ''Behind the Music'' tragedy. Remaining original members, the guitarist Gary Rossington and the keyboardist Billy Powell, continue in the tradition of the band's boogie stomp. 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $50.50. (Sinagra)    MADLIB, PEANUT BUTTER WOLF (Monday) He has just released an album as Quasimoto, but the nasal-voiced motormouth and D.J. performs here under his more frequent moniker with label mates including his old-school Bay Area producer, Peanut Butter Wolf. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $22.50. (Sinagra)    MAGIK MARKERS (Tonight) This noise-rock trio's sound assaults build from shirring buzz and ominous clang to maelstroms of bash and feedback. Kicking and jerking as the spirit moves her, the vocalist and guitarist Elisa Ambrogio surges from hiss to howl, wrestling with her guitar to choke out its most dangerous peals. 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $8. (Sinagra)    MC LYTE (Tonight) The last decade has been full of comeback attempts by this 80's hip-hop star who, along with artists like Roxanne Shante, was vocal about the macho rap game. If her music hasn't kept up with the latest trends, her feminist message about misogyny in hip-hop is timely. 10 p.m., Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)645-5156, $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO (Thursday) Jack Dangers has been layering together samples since the heyday of industrial rock in the 80's. On Meat Beat Manifesto's latest album, ''At the Center'' (Thirsy Ear), he mixes jazz musicians and the voice of the poet Kenneth Rexroth, letting his densely packed tracks swing as much as they stomp. With Ming & FS and Dub trio opening. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $22.50, $25 at the door. (Pareles)    NEW PORNOGRAPHERS, THE STARS, THE SADIES (Tomorrow) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension that makes anthems of their absurdist lyrical bric-a-brac. See below for Stars. The country rockers the Sadies open. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation. (Sinagra)    OJOS DE BRUJO (Tuesday) Plunging flamenco into the disc-jockey era, Ojos de Brujo, from Barcelona, mixes club beats, punk guitar and socially conscious rapping with the old Gypsy passion. 8 p.m. Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800,$25, $30 at the door. (Pareles)    PAJO, GRIZZLY BEAR, SOFT CIRCLE, MIIGHTY FLASHLIGHT (Tomorrow) David Pajo's meandering guitar forays have graced bands like Slint and Zwan.

(Sinagra)    EDDIE PALMIERI (Tomorrow and Thursday) Latin pianists have a longstanding affinity for jazz, but Eddie Palmieri may well be the jazziest and most experimental of them all, plunging into modal harmonies and burly, splashing chord clusters, building suspense and then detonating it with rhythm. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, Isaac Stern Auditorium, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)247-7800, $45 to $85. Thursday at noon, BAM R&B Festival, Metrotech Commons, Downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles)    ROBERT PLANT (Sunday and Monday) After scaling hard-rock peaks in his prime, the Led Zeppelin frontman's solo efforts never matched the skin-tight hedonism of his heyday. No one would blame him for joining the suit-and-standards circuit, but his new ''Mighty Rearranger'' (Sanctuary), rocks confidently, incorporating West African folk and the Islamic modal patterns that his band once mined with ''Kashmir.'' 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070, $33.50 to $78.50. (Sinagra)    PUCHO AND HIS LATIN SOUL BROTHERS (Tomorrow) In the 1960's, soul met Latin music in the form of the boogaloo, an earthy beat that has survived the intervening decades. The timbales player Henry Brown, aka Pucho, is loyal to the heyday of musicians like Joe Bataan and Mongo Santamaria. 7:30 p.m., Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center Plaza, (212)875-5766, $15. (Pareles)    * LUCIA PULIDO (Thursday) Lucia Pulido, a singer from Colombia, merges traditional Colombian songs with modern jazz. As Susana Baca has done with Afro-Peruvian songs, Ms. Pulido holds on to the rawness of the original melodies while giving them a sophisticated new context. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155, $15. (Pareles)    REEL BIG FISH (Wednesday) How many iterations is the punk-ska hybrid good for? Another one, at least, as bands like Reel Big Fish pump out bratty, bouncy pop. With El-Pus and Punchline opening. 7 p.m. Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $21. (Pareles)    THE ROOTS, DE LA SOUL, MF DOOM (Tuesday) The funky, experimental hip-hop band the Roots, the wordsmith rappers De La Soul. But the big news is the appearance of MF Doom, the MC sometimes known as Madvillain, whose wildly imaginative raps glower and shimmer over a current of poetic pain. A creator of New York's jazzy hip-hop sound, D.J. Premier is performing as well. 5 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212)307-7171, $36. (Sinagra)    MICHELLE SHOCKED (Wednesday) The eclectic Texan folk-rocker Ms. Shocked will perform three shows in a row. The first gives Disney songs a Western kick, the second is countryfied rock, and the late show will be a borderland tribute to the singer-songwriter's Southwestern roots. 3 p.m., 7 p.m., 9: 30, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778, $30. (Sinagra)    THE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES (Sunday) The Soundtrack of Our Lives, a Swedish band that sings in English. The band has learned a lot from the early Pink Floyd, the early Who, the Beatles circa 1967 and countless more obscure English and American bands; it recaptures the sense of teetering between discovery and disillusionment. Midnight. Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $17. (Pareles)    STARS (Tonight) The Canadian indie band the Stars play achingly pretty boy-girl vocal pop that makes a dreamy soundtrack for a quarter-life crisis. 11 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $15.(Sinagra)    JAMES TAYLOR (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Taylor makes blanket music. Sometimes it is as reassuring as an electric blanket, other times it's as annoying as a wet blanket, and almost all of the time it attempts to envelop existence in one large monochrome blanket, grappling with birth, love, pain, friendship, madness and death in such universal terms that to wallow in a specific tragedy -- and Mr. Taylor has been faced with many over the years -- is to commit a sin of solipsism. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400. $25 to $69.50. (Pareles)    TEGAN AND SARA, RON SEXSMITH, EAST VILLAGE OPERA (Sunday) The Canadian twins Tegan and Sara's lyrics about love and loss are underground girl anthems. As of late, their acoustic folk has given way to power pop topped with their tart vocals. Mr. Sexsmith sings affecting folk rock, and the East Village Opera Company puts a glam rock spin on classic arias. 3 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, free. (Sinagra)    RICHARD THOMPSON (Tuesday) Rock's smartest misanthrope is also one of its greatest guitarists. Richard Thompson, who was one of the architects of British trad-rock in the 1960's, writes songs steeped in Celtic melody and the stoicism of traditional ballads. This is a solo acoustic concert. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, World Financial Center, 200 Liberty Street, (212)945-2600, free (Pareles)    MARY TIMONY (Tomorrow) Ms. Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. With Medications, Bella Lea and Minaret opening. 8 p.m. Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10, $12 tomorrow. (Pareles)    FRANCISCO ULLOA (Wednesday) Francisco Ulloa, from the Dominican Republic, is one of the world's fastest, wildest accordion soloists. Playing merengue tunes that barely pause for breath, he takes off from the traditional fast arpeggios into breakneck solos that loop and stutter all over the galloping beat. 7:30 p.m., Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center Plaza, (212)875-5766, $15. (Pareles)    WINGDALE COMMUNITY SINGERS, CLAUDIA GONSON (Tonight) The guitarist David Grubbs, the vocalist Hannah Marcus and the novelist Rick Moody get together and make literate folk.

(Chinen)    KNEEBODY (Thursday) Rock, funk and electronic music commingle convincingly with jazz on ''Kneebody'' (Greenleaf), this quintet's recent studio debut; it's an update of the rugged, exploratory early fusion of Weather Report and Return to Forever, and just as likely to sound better live. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between North Third Street and Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934.

(Chinen)    GRETCHEN PARLATO GROUP (Thursday) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a recent deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, underscored here by the guitarist Guilherme Monteiro, the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Adam Cruz. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063.

Opera    'SAMSON ET DALILA' (Friday) It's all about sex and violence, yet Saint-Saens's biblical opera is one of the most static in the repertory. This makes it ideal for a concert presentation, particularly given that it has some of the best arias ever written for mezzo-soprano, and the Met in the Parks series version is perfectly respectable, sturdily led by Julius Rudel. 8 p.m., Brookdale Park, Bloomfield/Montclair, N.J., (212)362-6000, free. (AnneMidgette)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) The Met in the Parks series concludes with this free al fresco performance of the Puccini favorite.

(Midgette)    EVELYN GLENNIE (Sunday) Ms. Glennie is one of the few classical percussionists to have had a solo career on the international touring circuit. In recent years this dynamic Scottish artist has been urging critics and presenters to play down her much discussed hearing impairment. For most audiences, all thoughts of disability disappear in the presence of Ms. Glennie's brilliant performances. On Sunday afternoon she ends this season's ''Free for All at Town Hall'' series with a typically adventurous program, including works by Matthias Schmitt, Keiko Abe, Toshimitsu Tanaka and others. 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)707-8787, free; two tickets per person are available at the box office, starting at noon.(Anthony Tommasini)    HUDSON VALLEY CHAMBER MUSIC CIRCLE (Tomorrow) This 55-year-old organization presents visiting ensembles in a short series at Bard College, in a preface, of sorts, to Bard's own summertime explosion of music.

(Midgette)    SOLSTICE FESTIVAL (Sunday) The theme is Faust; the subtheme, Walpurgisnacht. And the music is accordingly obvious (songs of Mephistopheles by Wagner and Busoni), as well as less so (Mendelssohn's String Octet rather than his ''Erste Walpurgisnacht''). 3 p.m., Synagogue for the Arts, 49 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)696-6569; $25; $20 for 65+; $10 for students.

Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Holland Cotter)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE,' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI, 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)    * STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with, scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    Galleries: 57th Street    MARY ANN CURRIER With a satiny, soft-edged touch and an intense attention to texture, light and detail, this 78-year-old Louisville, Ky.-based painter gives dying roses a vivid and slightly weird tangibility. Gerald Peters, 24 East 78th Street, (212)628-9760, through July 1. (Johnson)    'GEE'S BEND QUILTS' Quilt's made by women of the tiny hamlet of Gee's Bend, Ala., have been making the rounds of United States museums since 2002. For those who are still unacquainted with those extraordinary works of folk art that resonate strikingly with Modernist abstraction, this small show is a good introduction. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through July 22.(Johnson)    JAUNE QUICK-TO-SEE-SMITH: 'CONNECTIONS' Ms. Quick-to-See-Smith is widely known for blending Modernist style, Native American themes and symbols and politics. The most impressive work in this selection of recent and older works is a protest against war: a cartoonish, brusquely painted, mural-scale picture of a canoe loaded with infernal images from Indian, Mexican and Medieval European cultures as well as figures from Picasso's ''Guernica.'' Flomenhaft, 547 West 27th Street, (212)268-4952, through July 2. (Johnson)    THOMAS SCHÜTTE: 'ONE MAN HOUSES' Models of small, modernistic houses meant to be built full-size by collectors, who buy them and furniture made from hollow-core doors, reflect on design and consumerism but with less formal interest and conceptual wit than do the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through July 2. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through July 22. (Johnson)    CHAN CHAO: 'ECHO' Tension between the clinical and the voyeuristic animates high-definition portraits of attractive nude woman by a photographer known for portraits of young Burmese rebel soldiers. Yancy Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through July 2. (Johnson)    'SURFACE' This engaging exhibition presents paintings and drawings that possess notable surface qualities ranging from glossy to crusty as well as Pop Art tendencies. Participants include Aaron Parazette, Torben Giehler, John Wesley, Chris Kysor, Andrew Masullo and more than 25 others. Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, through July 1. (Johnson)    KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    * MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through October 15. (Johnson)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    * 'ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    JASPER JOHNS: CATENARY Paintings and drawings less mandarin in their personal iconography only by comparison with the clotted art of the 1980's and 90's. There is a series of stupendously beautiful prints. The redeeming through line is touch, whose eloquence nearly salvages the works from their own oppressive claustrophobia. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)243-0200, closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)    HIROSHI SUGIMOTO Photographs of antique mathematical and mechanical models, evoking Brancusi, Arp and Man Ray, turning their subjects into big-screen cinematic presences, curvaceous and potent. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212)627-1018, closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' closing today. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453.

3," Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Opens tomorrow. The Aquila Theater presents Shakespeare's comedy about mistaken identities, unrequited love and the threats of a puritanical zealot (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200.    'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Opens Tuesday. Edward Albee covered man-goat love. Now Adam Bock looks into man-shark romance in his new nonrealistic comedy about young urban types (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422. 'BOOCOCK'S HOUSE OF BASEBALL' Opens Thursday. Sick of politics, Paul Boocock, a solo comic performer, searches for answers in the national pastime, relating stories about Jason Giambi, Derek Jeter and Pete Rose (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 352-3100.    'DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE' Previews start tomorrow. . Opens Thursday. A reggae-infused drama about four people in Jamaica searching for a new direction (2:00). TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, garment district (212)868-4444.    'AS YOU LIKE IT' Previews start tomorrow . Opens July 12. Up-and-comer Lynn Collins, who was Portia in the recent film of ''The Merchant of Venice,'' plays one of Shakespeare's most beloved heroines, Rosalind, in Mark Lamos's production in Shakespeare in the Park. Brian Bedford and Richard Thomas star (2:40). Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. Entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West and at 79th Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)539-8750.    Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' The debate about evoking the proper measurements of humor and pathos in the plays of Anton Chekhov is settled evenly if dubiously in Scott Zigler's production for the Atlantic Theater Company: It fails more or less equally at eliciting laughter and tears (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, garment district, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' When the eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent trial of the century -- the first of many in the 20th -- was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' recounts the sensational events with nuance and admirable research, but the passionless production unfortunately has the whiff of the whiff of Masterpiece Theater (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.( Zinoman)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)    'PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE' This unrewarding Athol Fugard play benefits from some rewarding performances by its four actors. O'Mara Leary is Milly, who on her 50th birthday has been dumped by her boyfriend, and tries to keep her spirits up by recruiting some pals to join her in what turns out to be the worst birthday party ever (1:30). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.( Genzlinger)    * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Alan Ayckbourn's 67th play, a minor-key comedy about six Londoners leading lives of quiet desperation, is rueful, funny, touching and altogether wonderful. Sir Alan's flawless cast amplifies the emotional impact of his writing in variously subtle and hilarious ways, while respecting the depth in his literary spareness (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    'UNSUSPECTING SUSAN' Celia Imrie stars as a snobbish Englishwoman in this funny, engaging (mostly) and tragic one-woman show written by Stewart Permutt. Ms. Imrie's character frets about her troubled son, living in London with a charming man, but doesn't begin to grasp how worried she should really be (1:10).

( Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG TIMES' Did you hear the one about the three actresses who wrote themselves a play? The punchline is this sweet, slender homage to the glory days of vaudeville, complete with goofy jokes, gags, and good music by the Moonlighters: kids are as likely to enjoy it as adults. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    * 'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film ''Bamboozled.'' This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like ''Frankenstein'' and ''King Kong'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444.( Zinoman)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10).

( Isherwood)    'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'HECUBA' Revenge is a dish served at room temperature in the intelligent but passionless production starring Vanessa Redgrave. Ms. Redgrave intriguingly brings forth the cool strategist inside the battered woman. But if we can admire this abject figure's salvaged aplomb, we rarely get a visceral sense of the despair and the rage at injustice that make the character such a compelling one (1:45). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, (718)636-4100, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'JACKSON'S WAY' Thirty-one-year-old Will Adamsdale isn't so much a comedian as a veritable wizard; a virtuoso of the transcendently absurd. Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, he spins a wacky world of increasingly bizarre nonsense out of thin air, creating an exquisitely idiosyncratic worldview that is as funny as it is wonderfully weird, all in the guise of being a life coach named Chris John Jackson, inventor of the motivational technique (1:15). Part of Brits Off Broadway. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban)    'LITTLE MARY' William S. Leavengood's parable about faith, politics and conservatism in the Roman Catholic Church can sound more like a position paper than a play, but the author's strong storytelling instincts can't be denied (2:10). Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'MARK TWAIN TONIGHT!' In a role he has been playing over half a century, Hal Holbrook delivers a performance that is perhaps most remarkable for the energy it derives from a studied languor. Mr. Holbrook's Twain is an exhilarating master of theatrical passive aggression, while Twain's observations about corrupt journalists, politicians and religious fanatics remain soberingly relevant (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES C' Horton Foote, the Chekhov of the South, tries something different with his gothic depression-eratale ''The One-Armed Man,'' the highlight of the third series of the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual collection of short plays, which always features a few wonderful pleasures. Along with Mr. Foote's chilling drama is Craig Lucas's shrewd portrait of a troubled woman, ''Your Call is Important,'' which plays on, among other things, New Yorker's neurosis about country life, and two minor pieces by Kate Long and Romulus Linney (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101), closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'SENECA'S OEDIPUS' In the new production of Seneca's ''Oedipus'' by the Theater by the Blind, the iconic story of the king of Thebes who unknowingly murders his father and marries his mother is performed in modern dress. The poet Ted Hughes's masterly 1968 adaptation is vividly alive, contemporary and shocking (1:30). Mint Space, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Honor Moore)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that ultimately pays off with some great laughs. This 1773 comedy mocks the London upper class's snobbery, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.(Brantley)    'THE WHORE OF SHERIDAN SQUARE' Michael Baron has written and directed this merry tribute to Charles Ludlam, who died of AIDS at 44, cutting short one of the most influential careers in downtown theater. For many downtown theatergoers, this silly -- or should I say, ridiculous -- dramatization of the life of Ludlam will be a nostalgic kick, like bumping into an old friend who you haven't seen in a long time (1:50).

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)    * 'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    '5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)    'HEIGHTS' (R, 93 minutes) In its aspirations, design and worldview, ''Heights'' resembles a number of other films about cozily connected souls, a soap-operatic subgenre that might be called We Are the World. Everybody hurts, as Michael Stipe likes to sing, but people in ''Heights'' seem to hurt more or at least spend a lot of time nursing that hurt in brooding silence and noisy confrontation. (Dargis)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    * 'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) About a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's cleareyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)    * 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WAGING A LIVING' and 'ROSEVELT'S AMERICA' (No rating, 85 and 25 minutes) An eye-opening, often heartbreaking documentary tracking four members of the working poor in the Northeast and California. Roger Weisberg's feature is accompanied by his short film, ''Rosevelt's America,'' a vérité profile of the Liberian refugee Rosevelt Henderson.(Jeannette Catsoulis)    Film Series    HANNA SCHYGULLA (through June 30) The Museum of Modern Art concludes its 11-film retrospective of the work of Ms. Schygulla, the multi-award-winning German actress.

She's good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best songs are quirky, plucked jazz-tinged numbers that make her sound like a hipper Norah Jones. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)    RUTH GERSON (Thursday) With a voice that rises from tender endearments to a bluesy, impassioned growl, Ruth Gerson sings folk-rock songs that reach for the status of anthems. 8 p.m. Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077, $10. (Pareles)    THE GET UP KIDS, FRENCH KICKS (Tonight) The jumping-bean energy of the emo rock stalwarts the Get Up Kids shames anyone not pogo-ing to their earnest beat.

(Pareles)    JOHN HIATT, THE NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tomorrow) Mr. Hiatt's songs get to the heart of human frailty, loyalty and love, even if they take a sidelong route. With a deep-diving baritone, a twang-happy band and enough strange facial expressions to rival Jim Carrey, Mr. Hiatt sings his songs as convincingly as anyone around. The jamming Southern rock band North Mississippi All-Stars play an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the Mississippi Delta and the hill country nearby. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door.

(Sanneh)    LA LEY (Thursday) La Ley, from Mexico, is a long-running Rock en Español band that's hugely popular south of the border. It's also a painfully earnest band aspiring to be Mexico's answer to U2 or Depeche Mode. This is billed as its final tour. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 Thursday. (Pareles)    TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS, RADIO 4 (Sunday) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and sudden falsetto also recall the melodic 70's arena-rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. Radio 4 plays steadily improving post-punk. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800. $15.(Sinagra)    * ELLA LEYA (Tomorrow) Born in Azerbaijan and celebrated as a jazz singer in what was the Soviet Union, Ella Leya rediscovered the melancholy songs called Russian romances after she emigrated to the United States.

(Pareles)    LEZ ZEPPELIN, (Wednesday) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy. Of course, they also have their gender-bending way with macho metaphors about squeezed lemons and dripping honey. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)    LHASA (Thursday) Lhasa sings in Spanish, French and English, with a husky, torchy voice that fills her music with the smoldering drama of Mexican boleros and French chansons. 8 p.m. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $20, $25 at the door. (Pareles)    THE LITTLE KILLERS, CHEATER SLICKS (Thursday) This garage-rock showcase stars the local trio the Little Killers and Cheater Slicks, a veteran band that finds ways to combine exuberance with meanness. 9 p.m., Sin-é, 148-150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077, $10. (Sanneh)    * THE LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) The Long Blondes, a three-woman, two-man band from England, hark back to the sparse, scrabbling late-1970's post-punk of the Slits and Delta Five on the handful of songs they have released, including the eager ''Giddy Stratospheres'' (What's Your Rupture), which takes some unexpected turns. 11 p.m., TriBeCa Grand, 2 Avenue of the Americas, at Church Street, (212) 519-6677; free with RSVP to getrad@igetrvng.com. (Pareles)    LONGWAVE (Wednesday) Longwave ponders self-destruction and transcendence in brooding songs with guitar lines that coil and climb.

(Pareles)    LYNYRD SKYNYRD (Sunday) Their funky Southern hard rock made them one of the best bands of the 70's, and the plane crash that killed the singer Ronnie Van Zant and others made Skynyrd's story the most horrific ''Behind the Music'' tragedy. Remaining original members, the guitarist Gary Rossington and the keyboardist Billy Powell, continue in the tradition of the band's boogie stomp. 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $50.50. (Sinagra)    MADLIB, PEANUT BUTTER WOLF (Monday) He has just released an album as Quasimoto, but the nasal-voiced motormouth and D.J. performs here under his more frequent moniker with label mates including his old-school Bay Area producer, Peanut Butter Wolf. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $22.50. (Sinagra)    MAGIK MARKERS (Tonight) This noise-rock trio's sound assaults build from shirring buzz and ominous clang to maelstroms of bash and feedback. Kicking and jerking as the spirit moves her, the vocalist and guitarist Elisa Ambrogio surges from hiss to howl, wrestling with her guitar to choke out its most dangerous peals. 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $8. (Sinagra)    MC LYTE (Tonight) The last decade has been full of comeback attempts by this 80's hip-hop star who, along with artists like Roxanne Shante, was vocal about the macho rap game. If her music hasn't kept up with the latest trends, her feminist message about misogyny in hip-hop is timely. 10 p.m., Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)645-5156, $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO (Thursday) Jack Dangers has been layering together samples since the heyday of industrial rock in the 80's. On Meat Beat Manifesto's latest album, ''At the Center'' (Thirsy Ear), he mixes jazz musicians and the voice of the poet Kenneth Rexroth, letting his densely packed tracks swing as much as they stomp. With Ming & FS and Dub trio opening. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $22.50, $25 at the door. (Pareles)    NEW PORNOGRAPHERS, THE STARS, THE SADIES (Tomorrow) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension that makes anthems of their absurdist lyrical bric-a-brac. See below for Stars. The country rockers the Sadies open. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation.

(Sinagra)    EDDIE PALMIERI (Tomorrow and Thursday) Latin pianists have a longstanding affinity for jazz, but Eddie Palmieri may well be the jazziest and most experimental of them all, plunging into modal harmonies and burly, splashing chord clusters, building suspense and then detonating it with rhythm. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, Isaac Stern Auditorium, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)247-7800, $45 to $85. Thursday at noon, BAM R&B Festival, Metrotech Commons, Downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles)    ROBERT PLANT (Sunday and Monday) After scaling hard-rock peaks in his prime, the Led Zeppelin frontman's solo efforts never matched the skin-tight hedonism of his heyday. No one would blame him for joining the suit-and-standards circuit, but his new ''Mighty Rearranger'' (Sanctuary), rocks confidently, incorporating West African folk and the Islamic modal patterns that his band once mined with ''Kashmir.'' 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070, $33.50 to $78.50. (Sinagra)    PUCHO AND HIS LATIN SOUL BROTHERS (Tomorrow) In the 1960's, soul met Latin music in the form of the boogaloo, an earthy beat that has survived the intervening decades. The timbales player Henry Brown, aka Pucho, is loyal to the heyday of musicians like Joe Bataan and Mongo Santamaria. 7:30 p.m., Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center Plaza, (212)875-5766, $15. (Pareles)    * LUCIA PULIDO (Thursday) Lucia Pulido, a singer from Colombia, merges traditional Colombian songs with modern jazz.

(Pareles)    THE ROOTS, DE LA SOUL, MF DOOM (Tuesday) The funky, experimental hip-hop band the Roots, the wordsmith rappers De La Soul.

The band has learned a lot from the early Pink Floyd, the early Who, the Beatles circa 1967 and countless more obscure English and American bands; it recaptures the sense of teetering between discovery and disillusionment. Midnight. Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $17. (Pareles)    STARS (Tonight) The Canadian indie band the Stars play achingly pretty boy-girl vocal pop that makes a dreamy soundtrack for a quarter-life crisis. 11 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $15.(Sinagra)    JAMES TAYLOR (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Taylor makes blanket music. Sometimes it is as reassuring as an electric blanket, other times it's as annoying as a wet blanket, and almost all of the time it attempts to envelop existence in one large monochrome blanket, grappling with birth, love, pain, friendship, madness and death in such universal terms that to wallow in a specific tragedy -- and Mr. Taylor has been faced with many over the years -- is to commit a sin of solipsism. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400. $25 to $69.50. (Pareles)    TEGAN AND SARA, RON SEXSMITH, EAST VILLAGE OPERA (Sunday) The Canadian twins Tegan and Sara's lyrics about love and loss are underground girl anthems.

(Sinagra)    RICHARD THOMPSON (Tuesday) Rock's smartest misanthrope is also one of its greatest guitarists.

This is a solo acoustic concert. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, World Financial Center, 200 Liberty Street, (212)945-2600, free (Pareles)    MARY TIMONY (Tomorrow) Ms. Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces.

(Pareles)    FRANCISCO ULLOA (Wednesday) Francisco Ulloa, from the Dominican Republic, is one of the world's fastest, wildest accordion soloists.

(Chinen)    GRETCHEN PARLATO GROUP (Thursday) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a recent deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, underscored here by the guitarist Guilherme Monteiro, the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Adam Cruz. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063.

Three bright-eyed women come to the big city to become stars in this tribute to vaudeville starring Mia Barron, Maggie Lacey and Danielle Skraastad (1:30). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444.    'HECUBA' Preview today. Opens tomorrow. The ferocious Tony-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave roars as the former Queen of Troy in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Euripides' tragedy (1:45). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, (718)636-4100.    'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' Opens Sunday. Don't touch Harry K. Thaw's wife. Stanford White learned that the hard way, and this play with music documents how the architect was murdered and the subsequent media circus (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.

McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422.    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Previews start today. Opens June 25. The Aquila Theater presents Shakespeare's comedy about mistaken identities, unrequited love and the threats of a puritanical zealot (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200.    Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2005) Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'MARK TWAIN TONIGHT!' In a role he has been playing over half a century, Hal Holbrook delivers a performance that is perhaps most remarkable for the energy it derives from a studied languor. Mr. Holbrook's Twain is an exhilarating master of theatrical passive aggression, while Twain's observations about corrupt journalists, politicians and religious fanatics remain soberingly relevant (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'FASTER' Two sides of a love triangle snap under the pressure of our speeded-up culture in ''Faster'' by London's Filter Theater, part of the Brits Off Broadway festival. Based on James Gleick's book of the same name, the play is elegiac but also an exuberant demonstration of the electrifying acceleration of modern life (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.(Miriam Horn)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30) . Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Isherwood)    'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Éloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SENECA'S OEDIPUS' In the new production of Seneca's ''Oedipus'' by the Theater by the Blind, the iconic story of the king of Thebes who unknowingly murders his father and marries his mother is performed in modern dress. The poet Ted Hughes's masterly 1968 adaptation is vividly alive, contemporary and shocking (1:30). Mint Space, 311 West 43rd Street, (212)868-4444. (Honor Moore)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'DISCONNECT' Plant four witty, intellectually stimulating people around a dinner table and you might have an engaging play. Plant four uninsightful, insipid people around a dinner table and you have ''Disconnect,'' a new work by Rob Ackerman that lets some self-absorbed 30-somethings whine for two hours about lost friends and parental beatings of long ago (1:45). The Working Theater, at the East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Genzlinger)    * 'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film Bamboozled. This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like Frankenstein and King Kong (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, one block below Spring Street, (212)868-4444.(Jason Zinoman)    'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman)    'KICKER' What happens when a star journalist mistakes a seven-hour interview with a celebrity novelist for the beginning of a beautiful friendship? This premise is better than this would-be comedy, which doesn't manage to make its characters or situations credible enough to answer its own question. Best: the send-up of the Hollywood star spewing out the same old quotes -- and, true to the title, the last line. Connelly Theater, 220 East 4th Street, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    'LITTLE MARY' William S. Leavengood's parable about faith, politics and conservatism in the Roman Catholic Church can sound more like a position paper than a play, but the author's strong storytelling instincts can't be denied (2:10). Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-3101.(Andrea Stevens)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)    'TRAILERVILLE' Here in the age of baby-boomer angst about unwell parents, stages and bookshelves and movie-of-the-week schedules are full of old people and those who care for them, which means that the those who would visit the subject today need to make sure they're bringing some fresh insights. John Dufresne, a novelist trying full-length drama, doesn't in ''Trailerville,'' an unruly play with a respectable supply of nicely turned phrases but nothing new to add to the growing eldercare genre (2:15). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)868-4444, (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45).

Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES B' The second installment in this annual festival of short plays, which includes lively sketches by David Mamet and David Lindsay-Abaire, allows theatergoers the pleasure of hearing famous voices practicing scales, as it were, and of discovering that no matter what key they're singing in, they still sound like themselves (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet, Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'RICHARD AND ANNE' That idiot Shakespeare had it all wrong, according to ''Richard and Anne,'' an unknown script by Maxwell Anderson that is being energetically brought to light by the young actors of Mirror Repertory's training program. Tired of being maligned in productions of ''Richard III,'' the real Richard, no hunched back evident, comes back from the grave to set things straight (2:15). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. ( Midgette)    'WORK: A MADCAP TRAGI-PARODY OF CORPORATE AMERICA' Unless you've been living in a cave, Charlotte Meehan's play ''Work: A Madcap Tragi-Parody of Corporate America'' should sound familiar, starting with its title. But when real life tops fiction, what's left to say? Not much, in this case. And that's the problem (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407, closing on Thursday. (Stevens)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive, or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dreamworlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max.(Dana Stevens)    * 'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY' (PG, 120 minutes) The best efforts of the blue-ribbon cast cannot save this hopelessly stuffy, muddled screen adaptation of Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel set in Peru in the early 18th century. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured, and entertaining.(Holden)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, two actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    '5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting but chilly. (Scott)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    * 'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)    'LORDS OF DOGTOWN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Southern California skateboarders in the 1970's, when a hobby became a full-blown (and lucrative) subculture. Scruffy, loose and reckless, in the spirit of its time and place. (Scott)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)    * 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Youngsters will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful for this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity.(Ned Martel)    Film Series    JAMES DEAN (Through Thursday) Film Forum's two-week festival, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Dean's death, continues with his second film, Nicholas Ray's sympathetic juvenile delinquent drama ''Rebel Without a Cause'' (1955), tonight through Tuesday.

BAD PLUS (Tonight) This piano-driven power trio's adventurous spirit straddles the boundaries of jazz and rock, and their exuberant forays are way more fun than their sketchy decision to cover Nirvana's ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' would suggest. The players, native Midwesterners all, throw themselves into live shows with prairie-fire earnestness. 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street & Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, free. (Laura Sinagra)    BETTIE SERVEERT (Tomorrow) In the mid-90's, these Dutch bohemians' combination of bright, twisty guitar work and the breathy yet plucky voice of Carol Van Dyk became a college-rock mainstay. They remain resolutely quirky, continuing to deliver honest grownup pop dispatches. 8:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $15, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    BILAL (Thursday) Bilal has huge ambitions, spanning jazz and soul, funk and gospel, hip-hop and pop. Even when his material doesn't live up to those ambitions, he has musicality to spare. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212)243-4940, $22, $25 at the door.(Jon Pareles)    BOYZ II MEN (Tuesday) The smooth, if extravagantly produced, harmonies of this R&B quartet made the breakup anthem ''End of the Road'' and their duet with Mariah Carey, the epic after-death apology ''One Sweet Day'' blockbuster radio singles in the mid-90's. Recently, they have been sticking to greatest hits and cover projects. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305, $39 to $49. (Sinagra)    BRAVE COMBO (Thursday) Can every rock and pop style be reduced -- or elevated -- to the fast bounce of a polka? Brave Combo has been making polka hybrids since 1979. 10 p.m. Satalla, 37 West 26th Street (212)576-1155, $15, $18 at the door. (Pareles)    JOHN BUTLER TRIO, WOOD BROTHERS (Tuesday) John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $16, $18 at the door (sold out). (Pareles)    LAURA CANTRELL (Tuesday) With her old-timey country radio show on WFMU and real Southern roots, the guitarist and songwriter Laura Cantrell has a deep alt-country résum. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 7 p.m., Virgin Megastore, Union Square, 52 East 14th Street, (212)598-4666, free. (Sinagra)    VANESSA CARLTON (Tuesday) The Wayans brothers' ''White Chicks'' poked fun at the pianist and songwriter Vanessa Carlton's daintily petulant 2002 hit ''A Thousand Miles,'' while acknowledging that it's a truly infectious sinagalong. Her recent efforts reveal charming lyrics, though the her piano playing is still rather fussy. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $20. (Sinagra)    * DERRICK CARTER (Sunday) Count on Mr. Carter to spin an exciting, unpredictable set. He loves to enliven his thwacking house beats with squiggles and squelches, and he gravitates toward robotic bass lines, disembodied voices and scrambled snippets of disco and jazz. With Miss Honey Dijon. 10 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, near Greenwich Street, the Meatpacking District, (212)645-5700, $15. (Kelefa Sanneh)    CJ CHENIER (Sunday) This son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, picked up his father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. 6:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155, $22. (Pareles)    THE COMAS (Tomorrow) Like a lot of indie rock bands, the Comas seem tentative about ''really trying.'' But when they do, as on the best cuts from last year's dreamy ''Conductor'' (Yep Roc), their portrayals of wage slavery and lolling slacker lust exude an intriguing passive-aggression. 10 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, rothkonyc.com, $10. (Sinagra)    COMETS ON FIRE (Thursday) As epic as the Grateful Dead in its late 60's ballroom era and as noisy as its distant forebears Sonic Youth, this band conjures dark granduer with guitars and organ creating a swirl of heedless squall. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $14, $16 at the door. (Sinagra)    ELYSIAN FIELDS (Tomorrow) With Jennifer Charles's smoky voice and Oren Bloedow's electric guitar, Elysian Fields conjure a haunted, late-night atmosphere in songs full of love and trouble. 9:30 p.m. Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200, $15. (Pareles)    FREE BLOOD (Tomorrow) This trio, a side-project of the dance-punk band called !!!, is the headliner at this concert devoted to discordant (and sometimes danceable) post-punk. The charming venue (long may it last) sells sweet confections, used records and beer, in three rooms on two levels. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212)253-0036, $6.(Sanneh)    ROBERT FRIPP (Thursday) The King Crimson guitarist and master of the spacey, droning combination of tape loops called ''Frippertronics'' performs selections from his ongoing ''Soundscapes'' project in this newly renovated space. 8 p.m., Concert Hall at the Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, 212874-5210 and 212712-7171, $37.50. (Sinagra)    DAVID GRUBBS (Tonight) The good parts of progressive rock -- its willingness to embrace complexity and eccentricity, its determination to avoid formulas -- have meant a lot to David Grubbs. He has been central to Gastr del Sol and Bastro, two bands known for heartfelt, wayward songs and excursions to the edges of rock. 8 p.m., the Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, $10. (Pareles)    LALAH HATHAWAY (Thursday) The daughter of the songwriter Donny Hathaway made a loving rhythm-and-blues album in 1990 and has since turned up as a jazz singer. This is a chance to hear what she's been up to lately. She plays this outdoor concert as part of BAM's R&B Festival. 12 p.m., MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles)    MICHAEL HURLEY, THE PLACES (Sunday) Mr. Hurley is one of the most fertile-minded of all the unreconstructed folkies. Though he's had his ups and downs, the humor and grooves of his detailed, offhandedly existential songs about talking porkchops and growing pot deserve a place in the American songbook. The Places are led by a Portland Americana artist, Amy Annelle. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $10. (Sinagra)    IRON & WINE (Tonight) The modern rustic Sam Beam takes a whispery, almost Chet Baker-like approach to folk vocals. Sung atop delicately plucked guitar, his lyrics speak to the sensitive male's concerns about intimacy and mortality. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, $18 , $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    JUNIOR SENIOR (Thursday) This Danish duo hit big in 2003 with the euphoric, semi-campy dancefloor dictum ''Move You Feet.'' Its exuberant thumps and shouts rang bells with dance-music and rock fans. Their new single, ''Itch U Can't Scratch,'' slows things down a bit, mixing disco and peppy old-school rap. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)    JORMA KAUKONEN (Saturday) One of the original psychedelic blues players, Jorma Kaukonen brought the Jefferson Airplane both searing electric guitar lines and old-fashioned blues. He then founded Hot Tuna, a band built on spiky, ragtimey blues. His own songs contemplate death and loss, holding his gentle voice in a lattice of fingerpicking. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd, (212)997-4144, $32.50, $36 at the door. (Pareles)    CYNDI LAUPER (Thursday) The new waver and activist Cyndi Lauper retains the zany streak that made her jumpy pro-girl pop songs and emotional synthesizer ballads favorites on MTV in the 1980's. She performs as part of Lincoln Center's Gay Pride salute lineup. Show time is 7 p.m., Rose Theater at the Time Warner Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500, $85 to $135. (Sinagra)    LITTLE RICHARD (Wednesday) Rock 'n' roll wouldn't be the same without the whoops and hollers, the pounding barrelhouse piano chords and swooping glissandos that Little Richard hurled onto his singles in the 1950's. Preaching from the piano stool and belting songs like ''Tutti Frutti,'' he's still a force for creative anarchy. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, $60 (Pareles)    M2O PLAY PIAZZOLA (Tomorrow) Accomplished tango musicians, the violinist Machiko Ozawa and the pianist Makia Matsumura interpret the roiling, fluid music of Astor Piazzolla, 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village , www.thestonenyc.com, $10. (Sinagra)    HUGH MASEKELA (Thursday) The South African flugelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zig-zagging possibilities of jazz. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)    MODEST MOUSE, CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN (Monday) The Modest Mouse frontman Isaac Brock uses his guitar to evoke creepy, lonely Northwestern expanses, but his rhythmic yen sometimes produces disco hybrids like the recent ''Float On,'' which unfurls bright guitar ribbons over a stomping beat. 80's college rock jokesters Camper van Beethoven recently reunited to release a concept album about a dystopian California. 6 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street, (212)360-2777, $30, $35 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    THE NATIONAL (Tonight) These Brooklynites play a kind of countryfied glowering rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. But even if the self-deprecating relationship woes of its frontman, Matt Berninger, recall those of the Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, his renderings have yet to make his gripes as interesting. 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $12 (sold out). (Sinagra)    THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS/GREEN MILK (Wednesday and Thursday) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until the voice of Neko Case cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)798-0406, sold out. June 25 at 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation.(Sinagra)    NORTHERN STATE, SUPAGROUP, JASON LOWENSTEIN, DJ EUGENE HUTZ (Wednesday) Hipster luminaries coming together in a benefit for a union representing Village Voice employees include Northern State, the female rappers from Long Island whose buoyant and self-aware rhyming tickled funny bones a couple of years ago; the raucously sloppy heavy metal act Supagroup, the energetic former Sebadoh member Mr. Lowenstein; and Gogol Bordello's self-proclaimed Gypsy-punk frontman Eugene Hutz. 8 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, rothkonyc.com, $10. (Sinagra)    OASIS, JET (Wednesday) No one ever accused Manchester's football-loving Gallagher brothers of originality or humility, and Oasis, their brash Beatlesque steamroller of a band, stands by their proven formula: simple, epic riffs, melodies arrogant in their inevitability and lyrics so dim they become profound. The one-hit rock 'n' rollers Jet open. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741, $34.50 to $75, (sold out). (Sinagra)    DON OMAR (Tomorrow) One of reggaeton's biggest names is a headliner at the ''2005 Latin Fest,'' an amusement-park concert where other performers include the salsa singer Victor Manuelle, the rapper Cuban Link and Hector el Bambino, another reggaeton star. 3 p.m., Northern Star Arena, Six Flags Great Adventure, 1090 King George Post Road, New Jersey Turnpike Exit 7A, Jackson, N.J., (732)928-1821, $53. (Sanneh)    TOM PETTY & THE HEARTBREAKERS+BLACK CROWES (Tuesday) The rocker Tom Petty's slightly technophobic 2002 ''The Last DJ'' (Warner Brothers) righteously lamented corporate greed and radio blandness. But it contained no especially radio-worthy songs. Nothing like the raw scrape of ''Refugee,'' the rousing ''Free Fallin''' or the darkly hyper ''American Girl.'' 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, (516)221-1000, $39.50 to $67.50.

But the big news of the week will be Jock Soto's farewell gala on Sunday afternoon and then, starting Tuesday, a seven-performance run of Balanchine's ''Midsummer Night's Dream,'' which will close out the season. Balanchine's first original full-length ballet, from 1962, this dance drama set to Mendelssohn's music has long been a company favorite.

(Dunning)    JODY SPERLING/TIME LAPSE DANCE (Thursday through June 26) Her fascination with the late 19th-century light-and-motion theater of Loie Fuller will be reflected in Ms. Sperling's new ''Debussy Soirée'' and in ''La Nuit,'' in a program of four dances that includes puppet performers.

(Dunning)    BILL YOUNG/COLLEEN THOMAS & DANCERS (Tonight) The choreographers examine the literal and figurative notions of entrances and exits in their new ''Dust.'' 7:30 p.m., NYU/Tisch School of the Arts, Fifth Floor Theater, 111 Second Avenue, East Village, (212)998-1982, $15.(Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Holland Cotter)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE,' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI, 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)    * STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    HUBERTUS GOJOWCZYK: 'THE BOOK AS OBJECT' If Joseph Cornell had been a librarian, he might have produced sculptures like the fantastically altered books that this Polish artist creates. Glass eyes stare out from the pages of one old tome; the corner of another morphs into a waxy brain. Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through June 24. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson)    THOMAS SCHÜTTE: 'ONE MAN HOUSES' Models of small, modernistic houses meant to be built full-size by collectors, who buy them and furniture made from hollow-core doors, reflect on design and consumerism but with less formal interest and conceptual wit than do the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through July 2. (Johnson)    'OK/OKAY' This entertaining two-gallery exhibition introduces 14 European artists whose works in nontraditional media tend to read like overproduced one-liners. Swiss Institute , 495 Broadway, (212)925-2035; and Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212)998-6780, through July 16. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    BENJAMIN BUTLER: 'FOREST'S EDGE' Abstracted landscapes made with a brusquely sensuous touch in finely tuned colors toy with conventions of early Modernism to visually exciting effect. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212)279-9219, through June 18. (Johnson)    SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through July 22. (Johnson)    CHAN CHAO: 'ECHO' Tension between the clinical and the voyeuristic animates high-definition portraits of attractive nude woman by a photographer known for portraits of young Burmese rebel soldiers. Yancy Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through July 2. (Johnson)    * GREGORY CREWDSON: BENEATH THE ROSES Narrative and theatrical craft have overtaken art and visual form in these dreary mural-size color photographs, which are so freighted with props, contrivances and omens, and so monotonously joyless that their sense of foreboding turns into parody. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street (212)206-6100, through June 18. (Smith)    JASPER JOHNS: CATENARY Paintings and drawings less mandarin in their personal iconography only by comparison with the clotted art of the 1980's and 90's. There is a series of stupendously beautiful prints. The redeeming through line is touch, whose eloquence nearly salvages the works from their own oppressive claustrophobia. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)243-0200, through June 25. (Kimmelman)    'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)    HIROSHI SUGIMOTO Photographs of antique mathematical and mechanical models, evoking Brancusi, Arp and Man Ray, turning their subjects into big-screen cinematic presences, curvaceous and potent. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212)627-1018, through June 25. (Kimmelman)    TIP TOLAND: 'CYCLE OF LIFE' Comically humane and technically impressive painted clay sculptures by this West Coast ceramicist include a life-size, nude, octogenarian lady in a sexy, standing pose and twin gray-haired women realized with remarkable realism from the waist up. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212)242-3013, through June 30. (Johnson)    KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    * MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    * 'ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25.(Johnson)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    JUDY LEDGERWOOD: 'SPRING FEVER' With a boldly insouciant touch and vibrantly dissonant colors, this Chicago-based artist makes grid-based pattern paintings using heraldic overtones and punchy mandala compositions of squished balloonlike shapes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)229-2757, through June 24. (Johnson)    MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)    MALCOM MORLEY: THE ART OF PAINTING After 30 years, Malcolm Morley returns to the Photo Realist painting style he helped found in the mid 1960's, further exploring the tensions between reality, the art of painting and the act of looking and demonstrating that fidelity, taken far enough, turns into something else. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)999-7337, through June 25. (Smith)    Last Chance    DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)255-8450, closing tomorrow.(Smith)    ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7600, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)    CORNELIA FOSS Graceful, mature, modest paintings full of light and a subtle geometry: views of the beaches and salt marshes on Long Island and of Central Park. DFN Gallery, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)    * JULIO GONZÁLEZ This small but illuminating 43-piece exhibition surveys the career of a sculptor who, late in life, taught Picasso how to work with metal and then went on in the 1930's to create playful, Cubist-style, welded iron assemblages that transformed modern sculpture. Instituto Cervantes, 211 East 49th Street, Turtle Bay, (212)308-7720, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JACQUELINE HUMPHRIES Gestural abstractions made with fluorescent paint, lighted by black lights, campy and eloquent. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)995-1785, closing tomorrow.(Kimmelman)    RINKO KAWAUCHI: 'AILA AND THE EYES, THE EARS' In her second New York show this young Japanese photographer is showing large pale close-ups of natural phenomenon -- fish eggs, dead chickens, a hatching bird -- reminding us with oddly visionary effects that life's big themes are in the details. Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-8711, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    ANNETTE LAWRENCE Ms. Lawrence, who is known for abstract works symbolizing themes of African-American ancestry, here presents an airy, expansive installation of many lengths of white string stretched in horizontal lines across the gallery. It is nicely complemented by musically suggestive drawings on brown paper composed of parallel pencil lines and calligraphic blobs in black, white and blood red. Betty Cunningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-2772, closing on Wednesday. (Johnson)    RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by this influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-9300, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * NEO RAUCH In his familiar and fashionable vein, mixing Pop, Surrealism, Socialist Realism and a stew of 19th-century sources, these latest paintings are more tours de force of labor and oddball design, chilly and sophisticated. The work is operating at a level where the air is thin and cold. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2070, closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)    JEFF SONHOUSE: 'THE PANOPTIC CON' As sharp visually as they are politically, Mr. Sonhouse's compact, finely painted Pop-Surrealist portraits depict masked African-American men in colorful tuxedos with hair made of real matches, steel wool and other materials. In some, subjects are shown twice, mug-shot style: face-forward and in profile. These slyly incendiary works probe the mystique of the mythic scary-sexy black dude. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)989-0082, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotumlike coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)627-8000, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    HIROSHI SUGITO AND ROSILINE LUDUVICO The Japan-based Mr. Sugito and the Germany-based Ms. Luduvico bring compatible sensibilities to this dual show. Painted with wispy delicacy, her small pictures of people in the woods conjure sweet, sad moods. His most imposing painting, a large luminous field of patchy green punctuated by little butterflies, projects a vigorously sensuousness fantasy of pastoral bliss. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)243-3335, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    JEAN CLAUDE WOUTERS: 'PORTRAITS & NUDES -- SPIRIT' Through a process of re-photographing his prints, this French artist creates large, black-and-white photographs that are so pale it may take a second to see the ghostly image of a nude torso or, more hauntingly, the larger-than-life face that seems to gaze at us from an ethereal realm. Meyerowitz, 120 11th Avenue, at 20th Street, (212)414-2770, closing tomorrow.

Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2005) Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.(Isherwood)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Éloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100. ( Van Gelder)    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakovbrothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'DISCONNECT' Plant four witty, intellectually stimulating people around a dinner table and you might have an engaging play. Plant four uninsightful, insipid people around a dinner table and you have ''Disconnect,'' a new work by Rob Ackerman that lets some self-absorbed 30-somethings whine for two hours about lost friends and parental beatings of long ago (1:45). The Working Theater, at the East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Genzlinger)    'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES B' The second installment in this annual festival of short plays, which includes lively sketches by David Mamet and David Lindsay-Abaire, allows theatergoers the pleasure of hearing famous voices practicing scales, as it were, and of discovering that no matter what key they're singing in, they still sound like themselves (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)    'RICHARD AND ANNE' That idiot Shakespeare had it all wrong, according to ''Richard and Anne,'' an unknown script by Maxwell Anderson that is being energetically brought to light by the young actors of Mirror Repertory's training program. Tired of being maligned in productions of ''Richard III,'' the real Richard, no hunched back evident, comes back from the grave to set things straight (2:15). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'WORK: A MADCAP TRAGI-PARODY OF CORPORATE AMERICA' Unless you've been living in a cave, Charlotte Meehan's play ''Work: A Madcap Tragi-Parody of Corporate America,'' should sound familiar, starting with its title. But when real life tops fiction, what's left to say? Not much, in this case. And that's the problem (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407.(Andrea Stevens)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200.

Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    Last Chance    'BFE' Julia Cho's insightful drama about the agonies and comforts of isolation centers on a 14-year-old Asian-American girl (Olivia Oguma) who feels she isn't beautiful. The main characters force themselves to reach out to others, but all fail in some essential way (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.(Gates)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday.(Miriam Horn)    'DAY IN THE LIFE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE' Talent and passion are overcome by banality in the first musical by the Broadway actor Josh Walden, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, choreographed the show, and directed. While the music and dance show occasional flair, the same cannot be said of the lyrics or book, a clichéd exhuming of the secrets behind 1950's facades (1:00). Flamboyan Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4080, closing tomorrow. (Horn)    * 'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. ( Zinoman)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES A' A long, too often dreary evening of plays by a pair of Tony winners, John Guare and Warren Leight, and a pair of actress-playwrights, Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros and Leslie Lyles. Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros's contribution, ''The Airport Play,'' is the briefest and, perhaps not coincidentally, the best of the bunch (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow.(Isherwood)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'TABLOID CALIGULA' Three excellent performances set off Darren Murphy's dark comedy, about a London thug hooked on Alexander the Great, in which the author has a lot of fun with language and the art of storytelling (1:30). Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. ( Stevens)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In the contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug-of-war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured, and entertaining.(Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    * 'ROCK SCHOOL' (R, 93 minutes) Don Argott's alternately hilarious and alarming documentary centers on the titular founder of the Paul Green School of Rock Music and a handful of tender tots who yearn for a future filled with squealing electric guitars, battered drum kits and fully cranked amps. (Dargis)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SAVING FACE' (R, 91 minutes) The amiable romantic comedy examines the lives of three generations of Chinese-Americans living in New York exudes a palpable love for its characters but ends up betraying its hard-headedness with instant, feel-good solutions to their problems. (Holden)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Dana Stevens)    * 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    * 'THE WHITE DIAMOND' (No rating, 90 minutes) Werner Herzog, in the jungles of Guyana, observes a small airship and its crew. This documentary is a record of his impressions and discoveries, and an essay on the complexities of nature in its wild and human varieties. It is an unassuming film, but nonetheless full of scenes and images that can only be described as sublime. (Scott)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)    Film Series    JAMES DEAN (Through June 23) Fifty years after Dean's death at the age of 24, Film Forum is screening all three of his movies, beginning with Elia Kazan's ''East of Eden'' (1955), in which Dean plays John Steinbeck's tortured bad boy trying to win his father's love.

ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, THE LILYS (Sunday and Monday) With their hip choral flourishes, kicky grooves and pep-rally shouts, the quirky collective Architecture in Helsinki makes happy baroque pop. Sunday's bill includes the Lilys, whose mercurial Kurt Heasley exuded charisma as both an early-90's shoegazer and later, an Anglophile retro-rocker. Sunday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door.

(Laura Sinagra)    THE BAD PLUS (Thursday) This piano-driven power trio's adventurous spirit straddles the boundaries of jazz and rock, and their exuberant forays are way more fun than their cover of Nirvana's ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' would suggest. The players, native Midwesterners all, throw themselves into live shows with prairie-fire earnestness. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $15, $20 at the door.(Sinagra)    ASHA BHOSLE (Tomorrow) In countless Bollywood musicals over the last 50 years, the sweet, high voice of the heroine is dubbed by Asha Bhosle, one of India's most celebrated playback singers. In this ''unplugged show,'' she'll be singing a small fraction of her hits with acoustic instruments, sharing the arena stage with Kumar Sanu and Sudesh Bhosle, who is not related to her. 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000, $32 to $147. (Jon Pareles)    BLOC PARTY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Many bands steal sounds from the danceable punk of the early 80's, but few do it with the enthusiasm of this British group. It's become a sensation with local fans and for good reason. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600. $20 (sold out) (Sinagra)    CAMPBELL BROTHERS (Monday) The Campbell Brothers are part of the sacred steel tradition of the House of God Dominion church. It turns the steel guitar into a swooping, wailing lead instrument in gospel songs. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $15, $17 at the door. (Pareles)    SLAID CLEAVES (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter writes thoughtful tunes about characters with pawn-shop wedding rings and cars that burn oil, trying to pull out of downward spirals. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)239-6200; $20. (Pareles)    KIMYA DAWSON (Tuesday) Ms. Dawson's band the Moldy Peaches' adorable dirty-kid rambles created an indie splash in 2001, but this former youth counselor endures on her own as a comedian and poet of geek love and underdog resilience. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $8. (Sinagra)    THE DEARS (Tomorrow) This Montreal indie rock band plays lush, urgent guitar songs about panicked slacker dismay over encroaching technology and the loss of an individuality. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15 (sold out).(Sinagra)    GENO DELAFOSE & FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Tonight) Geno Delafose, the son of the zydeco accordionist John Delafose, holds on to the traditions of an older generation, pumping waltzes and two-steps on his button accordion. Like Clifton Chenier, he also dips deeply into the blues and rhythm-and-blues but keeps the music's old bayou flavor. 8 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155; $22. (Pareles)    THE GO BETWEENS (Tonight and Tomorrow) Blessed with two stellar songwriters -- the brooding Robert Forster and sublime Grant McLennan -- this Australian band recorded some of the best neo-romantic art pop of the 1980's. Since the duo's 2002 reunion, the disparity in their temperaments has resulted in a more discernable oscillation between light and dark sentiments in the music. Tonight at 10:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $16, $18 at the door (sold out).

(Sinagra)    IRON AND WINE (Thursday) The modern rustic Sam Beame takes a whispery, almost Chet Baker-like approach to folk vocals.

(Sinagra)    JUDAS PRIEST, QUEENSRYCHE (Tonight) Rob Halford has brought his menacing baritone and dog-whistle howl back to the seminal late-70's British heavy-metal band that famously tried to carry on without him.

(Sinagra)    SANTANA, LOS LONELY BOYS (Tuesday) Carlos Santana has been a ''rock-en-espagñol'' progenitor and fusion guitar heavyweight for decades , but one of the most remarkable incarnations has been his recent one as lite-rock collaborator and impresario.

Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422.    'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' Previews start Wednesday. Opens June 19. Don't touch Harry K. Thaw's wife. Stanford White learned that the hard way, and this play with music documents how the architect was murdered and the subsequent media circus (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.    Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2005) Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.(Isherwood)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Éloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100. ( Van Gelder)    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakovbrothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'DISCONNECT' Plant four witty, intellectually stimulating people around a dinner table and you might have an engaging play. Plant four uninsightful, insipid people around a dinner table and you have ''Disconnect,'' a new work by Rob Ackerman that lets some self-absorbed 30-somethings whine for two hours about lost friends and parental beatings of long ago (1:45). The Working Theater, at the East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Genzlinger)    'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES B' The second installment in this annual festival of short plays, which includes lively sketches by David Mamet and David Lindsay-Abaire, allows theatergoers the pleasure of hearing famous voices practicing scales, as it were, and of discovering that no matter what key they're singing in, they still sound like themselves (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)    'RICHARD AND ANNE' That idiot Shakespeare had it all wrong, according to ''Richard and Anne,'' an unknown script by Maxwell Anderson that is being energetically brought to light by the young actors of Mirror Repertory's training program. Tired of being maligned in productions of ''Richard III,'' the real Richard, no hunched back evident, comes back from the grave to set things straight (2:15). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'WORK: A MADCAP TRAGI-PARODY OF CORPORATE AMERICA' Unless you've been living in a cave, Charlotte Meehan's play ''Work: A Madcap Tragi-Parody of Corporate America,'' should sound familiar, starting with its title. But when real life tops fiction, what's left to say? Not much, in this case. And that's the problem (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407.(Andrea Stevens)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!'

Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    Last Chance    'BFE' Julia Cho's insightful drama about the agonies and comforts of isolation centers on a 14-year-old Asian-American girl (Olivia Oguma) who feels she isn't beautiful. The main characters force themselves to reach out to others, but all fail in some essential way (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.(Gates)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday.(Miriam Horn)    'DAY IN THE LIFE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE' Talent and passion are overcome by banality in the first musical by the Broadway actor Josh Walden, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, choreographed the show, and directed. While the music and dance show occasional flair, the same cannot be said of the lyrics or book, a clichéd exhuming of the secrets behind 1950's facades (1:00). Flamboyan Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4080, closing tomorrow. (Horn)    * 'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. ( Zinoman)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES A' A long, too often dreary evening of plays by a pair of Tony winners, John Guare and Warren Leight, and a pair of actress-playwrights, Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros and Leslie Lyles. Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros's contribution, ''The Airport Play,'' is the briefest and, perhaps not coincidentally, the best of the bunch (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow.(Isherwood)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'TABLOID CALIGULA' Three excellent performances set off Darren Murphy's dark comedy, about a London thug hooked on Alexander the Great, in which the author has a lot of fun with language and the art of storytelling (1:30). Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. ( Stevens)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In the contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug-of-war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured, and entertaining.(Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    * 'ROCK SCHOOL' (R, 93 minutes) Don Argott's alternately hilarious and alarming documentary centers on the titular founder of the Paul Green School of Rock Music and a handful of tender tots who yearn for a future filled with squealing electric guitars, battered drum kits and fully cranked amps. (Dargis)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SAVING FACE' (R, 91 minutes) The amiable romantic comedy examines the lives of three generations of Chinese-Americans living in New York exudes a palpable love for its characters but ends up betraying its hard-headedness with instant, feel-good solutions to their problems. (Holden)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Dana Stevens)    * 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    * 'THE WHITE DIAMOND' (No rating, 90 minutes) Werner Herzog, in the jungles of Guyana, observes a small airship and its crew. This documentary is a record of his impressions and discoveries, and an essay on the complexities of nature in its wild and human varieties. It is an unassuming film, but nonetheless full of scenes and images that can only be described as sublime. (Scott)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)    Film Series    JAMES DEAN (Through June 23) Fifty years after Dean's death at the age of 24, Film Forum is screening all three of his movies, beginning with Elia Kazan's ''East of Eden'' (1955), in which Dean plays John Steinbeck's tortured bad boy trying to win his father's love.

ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, THE LILYS (Sunday and Monday) With their hip choral flourishes, kicky grooves and pep-rally shouts, the quirky collective Architecture in Helsinki makes happy baroque pop. Sunday's bill includes the Lilys, whose mercurial Kurt Heasley exuded charisma as both an early-90's shoegazer and later, an Anglophile retro-rocker. Sunday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. Monday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10. (Laura Sinagra)    THE BAD PLUS (Thursday) This piano-driven power trio's adventurous spirit straddles the boundaries of jazz and rock, and their exuberant forays are way more fun than their cover of Nirvana's ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' would suggest. The players, native Midwesterners all, throw themselves into live shows with prairie-fire earnestness. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $15, $20 at the door.(Sinagra)    ASHA BHOSLE (Tomorrow) In countless Bollywood musicals over the last 50 years, the sweet, high voice of the heroine is dubbed by Asha Bhosle, one of India's most celebrated playback singers. In this ''unplugged show,'' she'll be singing a small fraction of her hits with acoustic instruments, sharing the arena stage with Kumar Sanu and Sudesh Bhosle, who is not related to her. 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000, $32 to $147. (Jon Pareles)    BLOC PARTY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Many bands steal sounds from the danceable punk of the early 80's, but few do it with the enthusiasm of this British group. It's become a sensation with local fans and for good reason. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600. $20 (sold out) (Sinagra)    CAMPBELL BROTHERS (Monday) The Campbell Brothers are part of the sacred steel tradition of the House of God Dominion church. It turns the steel guitar into a swooping, wailing lead instrument in gospel songs. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $15, $17 at the door. (Pareles)    SLAID CLEAVES (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter writes thoughtful tunes about characters with pawn-shop wedding rings and cars that burn oil, trying to pull out of downward spirals. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)239-6200; $20. (Pareles)    KIMYA DAWSON (Tuesday) Ms. Dawson's band the Moldy Peaches' adorable dirty-kid rambles created an indie splash in 2001, but this former youth counselor endures on her own as a comedian and poet of geek love and underdog resilience. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $8. (Sinagra)    THE DEARS (Tomorrow) This Montreal indie rock band plays lush, urgent guitar songs about panicked slacker dismay over encroaching technology and the loss of an individuality. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15 (sold out).(Sinagra)    GENO DELAFOSE & FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Tonight) Geno Delafose, the son of the zydeco accordionist John Delafose, holds on to the traditions of an older generation, pumping waltzes and two-steps on his button accordion. Like Clifton Chenier, he also dips deeply into the blues and rhythm-and-blues but keeps the music's old bayou flavor. 8 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155; $22. (Pareles)    THE GO BETWEENS (Tonight and Tomorrow) Blessed with two stellar songwriters -- the brooding Robert Forster and sublime Grant McLennan -- this Australian band recorded some of the best neo-romantic art pop of the 1980's. Since the duo's 2002 reunion, the disparity in their temperaments has resulted in a more discernable oscillation between light and dark sentiments in the music. Tonight at 10:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $16, $18 at the door (sold out). Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $15, $17 at the door.(Sinagra)    ARLO GUTHRIE (Wednesday) Forty years after releasing ''Alice's Restaurant,'' the folk music scion Arlo Guthrie will perform his populist story-album in its entirety at the Hudson River Festival. You assume that he'll also sling some trademark banter between tunes. 7 p.m., Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, Lower Manhattan, (212)528-2733, free. (Sinagra)    IRON AND WINE (Thursday) The modern rustic Sam Beame takes a whispery, almost Chet Baker-like approach to folk vocals. Sung atop delicately plucked guitar, his lyrics speak to the sensitive male's concerns about intimacy and mortality. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village (212)353-1600; $18, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    RICKIE LEE JONES (Wednesday) Ms. Jones's Southwestern hippie roots give her urban-bohemian jazz leanings a willful whimsy. This outdoor set will cull from both the swooping reveries and ersatz street-corner jive of her 1970's releases as well as the best of her later albums. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation. (Sinagra)    JUDAS PRIEST, QUEENSRYCHE (Tonight) Rob Halford has brought his menacing baritone and dog-whistle howl back to the seminal late-70's British heavy-metal band that famously tried to carry on without him. Attempts at leather-clad relevance include an ode to the Loch Ness monster, but live they'll please the crowd with growler favorites. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Garden State Parkway, (732)335-0400, $20 to $49.50. (Sinagra)    CHAKA KHAN (Saturday) In the 2002 Funk Brothers documentary ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown,'' R&B luminaries reverentially jammed with the still-rocking house band, but Ms. Khan pushed past safe territory with her explosive rendition of ''What's Goin' On.'' Recently, she's been roughing up jazz standards and making funk with Prince. 7 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)307-7171; $37 to $57.(Sinagra)    LAURIE LEWIS, TOM ROZUM (Tomorrow) The master fiddler and singer Laurie Lewis shares the bill with her fellow Grant Street band member Rozum. The two play bluegrass in the style of Bill Monroe. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155; $20, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)    BRIAN MCKNIGHT, NEW EDITION, GERALD LEVERT (Tonight) The R&B crooner Brian McKnight returns with new songs about the romantic quandaries of a rich, newly divorced man. The reunion of 80's boy band New Edition, without Bobby Brown, is reportedly every bit the guilty pleasure it should be, featuring not only mega hits like ''Mr. Telephone Man,'' but also the best of members' spin off groups (Bell Biv DeVoe's ''Poison'') and solo projects (Ralph Tresvant's ''Sensitivity,'' Johnny Gill's ''My My My''). Their impassioned contemporary Gerald LeVert opens. 7 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $49.50 to $95.50. (Sinagra)    AIMEE MANN (Tonight) Ms. Mann's great new concept album about two addict lovers in the 70's who meet at the Virginia fairgrounds and light out for the territory features the astute, sad lyrics and low-key but enduring melodic hooks for which this singer-songwriter is known. 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $35. (Sinagra)    * OLIVER MTUKUDZI (Tonight) Like too many African stars, this Zimbabwean singer and nimble guitarist is often presented as a purveyor of ''words of wisdom,'' to quote the liner notes to his new album, ''Nhava'' (Heads Up). Luckily, his music isn't nearly so heavy-handed: expect a gorgeous night of gentle but restless polyrhythmic grooves. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824; $30 to $35.(Kelefa Sanneh)    THE NATIONAL (Wednesday and Thursday) These Ohio natives play a kind of countryfied indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. But even if the frontman Matt Berninger's self-deprecating relationship woes recall those of the Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, his renderings have yet to make his gripes as interesting. 10:30 and 11:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $12.(Sinagra)    MESHELL NDEGEOCELLO (Wednesday and Thursday through June 18) Uncompromising in her aesthetic, the neo-soul singer and bassist Ndegeocello continues to present various views of the female and black experience, often proposing a poly-gendered idyll of throwback grooves and pungent ganja smoke. 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; $40 (Sinagra)    OTEP (Tonight) Reminiscent of ''The Exorcist,'' the growl of this band's female singer and namesake Otep is a truly soul-shuddering sound. It's too bad the band's music, which takes the arty rap-rock route instead of straight death metal, doesn't have the same convincing pummel. 6 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $17. (Sinagra)    GRAHAM PARKER (Tomorrow) Emerging from England just before the arrival of punk-rock, Graham Parker used the sturdy structures of soul and 1960's rock, spitting out angry, articulate songs that chafed against dishonesties large and small. These days, he's less furious and more cranky, but he's still holding the world around him to high standards. 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $20, $22 at the door. (Pareles)    ANN PEEBLES (Thursday) This gutsy Memphis soul diva's profile rose among the MTV crowd when her eerie, sultry 1973 hit ''I Can't Stand the Rain'' was sampled in 1997 by Missy Elliot. Ms. Peebles performs outdoors as part of the BAM R&B Festival. Noon, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, free. (Sinagra)    JOHN PRINE (Wednesday) An American original, Prine is among Cole Porter with pop's greatest rhymers and with Bob Dylan among its most articulate sidelong storytellers. The administration of George Bush II has given this committed Lefty newfound fire. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824, $37 to $47. (Sinagra)    THE RAVEONETTES (Tomorrow) Clearing away the garage noise of their debut album, this Danish duo now strives for pure 60's pop. Its new album incorporates rock history from girl groups to surf rock to punk, as well as historic rock, with cameos by Ronnie Spector, Suicide's Martin Rev and the Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker. 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20. (Sinagra)    REBIRTH BRASS BAND (Tonight) The Rebirth Brass Band, a New Orleans institution since the 1980's, updates the traditional strutting rhythms and continuous improvisation of New Orleans parades with an infusion of funk. It doesn't need microphones, amplifiers or anything but breath and rhythm to make a crowd jump. 10:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144; $17, $20 at the door. (Pareles)    SLOAN (Monday and Tuesday) This Canadian power pop trio has soldiered along dutifully for 15 years, and as its recent singles compilations suggest, the group's knack with heroic hooks and wry lyrics is undeniable, despite lack of commercial success. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $20. (Sinagra)    SOUNDS OF DETROIT: THE SPINNERS, THE TEMPTATIONS, MARTHA REEVES AND THE VANDELLAS (Tonight) Their names may have outlasted their original lineups, but classics like ''My Girl,'' ''Rubbberband Man'' and ''Heatwave'' are classics in any iteration. 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-7171; $25 to $90. (Sinagra)    SANTANA, LOS LONELY BOYS (Tuesday) Carlos Santana has been a ''rock-en-espagñol'' progenitor and fusion guitar heavyweight for decades , but one of the most remarkable incarnations has been his recent one as lite-rock collaborator and impresario. Los Lonely Boys couldn't have existed without him. 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Garden State Parkway, Exit 116, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400; $20 to $75. (Sinagra)    THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS, RALPH'S WORLD (Tomorrow) The whip-smart wits of the novelty pop band They Might Be Giants have lately taken a run at recording children's albums. They play during the day here for an all-ages crowd. Another musician making indie rock for the kids of indie-rock fans is Ralph's World. 6 p.m., South Street Seaport, South and Fulton Streets, Lower Manhattan, free. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL (Sundays at 2 and 8 p.m.) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova.

(Chinen)    DAVE BINNEY'S BALANCE (Tuesday) The alto saxophonist Dave Binney heeds an avant-gardism that embraces harmony, melody and rhythm, along with amplification; he receives sinuous support from the keyboardist Craig Taborn, the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Dan Weiss. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883, $10. (Chinen)    * TERENCE BLANCHARD SEXTET /CLAUDIA ACUÑA BAND (Tuesday through June 19) With ''Flow'' (Blue Note), the trumpeter and composer Terence Blanchard chronicles the maturation of a working band that's equally comfortable mining hard bop, West African grooves, or R&B-steeped fusion; Ms. Acuña, opening each set of this engagement, is one of the more intriguing jazz vocalists of her generation. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592, cover, $25 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $15 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum.

This one-night stand reconvenes the musicians from the record: the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, the pianist Craig Taborn and the drummer Tom Rainey. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063, cover, $15, members, $10 (Chinen)    JIM HALL WITH GEOFFREY KEEZER (Tonight and Saturday) With his intimate, conversational approach to jazz guitar, Jim Hall has always found particular beauty in duets.

Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Holland Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals.

Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI: 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)    * STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with, scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    HUBERTUS GOJOWCZYK: 'THE BOOK AS OBJECT' If Joseph Cornell had been a librarian, he might have produced sculptures like the fantastically altered books that this Polish artist creates. Glass eyes stare out from the pages of one old tome; the corner of another morphs into a waxy brain. Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through June 24. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    DIANA MICHENER: 'DOGS, FIRES, ME' The photographs here, largely achieved by devices like blurring, montage, double exposure and extreme distortion, are supposedly evocative of poetic concepts, but they are for the most part stagey and pretentious, like scenes from a bad Surrealist movie. Swans, fires, puppets and Ms. Michener's nude body accompanied by a dog are some of the images, but seen through her lens they are quite yawn-provoking. Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street (212)759-8964, through June 22. (Glueck)    EMILY NELLIGAN AND MARVIN BILECK: 'CRANBERRY ISLAND, DRAWINGS AND PRINTS' Using only charcoal and eraser on ordinary letter paper, Emily Nelligan has for more than 50 years focused on a tiny part of Maine called Great Cranberry Island, one of several specks off the coast near Mount Desert. Restricting her palette to reticent blacks, whites and grays, she conveys the spirit, changes and constancies of a pure, unsullied wilderness. Marvin Bileck, her husband, has concentrated on the island's factual here-and-nowness, rendering piled-up rocks, tangles of trees, deep woods and their tweakings by nature in meticulous drawings and etchings. She's a wizard at mood, he's a master of specifics. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, through June 17. (Glueck)    THOMAS SCHÜTTE: 'ONE MAN HOUSES' Models of small, modernistic houses meant to be built full-size by collectors, who buy them and furniture made from hollow-core doors, reflect on design and consumerism but with less formal interest and conceptual wit than do the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through July 2. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    BENJAMIN BUTLER: 'FOREST'S EDGE' Abstracted landscapes made with a brusquely sensuous touch in finely tuned colors toy with conventions of early Modernism to visually exciting effect. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through June 18. (Johnson)    SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through June 25. (Johnson)    CHAN CHAO: 'ECHO' Tension between the clinical and the voyeuristic animates high-definition portraits of attractive nude woman by a photographer known for portraits of young Burmese rebel soldiers. Yancy Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through July 2. (Johnson)    * GREGORY CREWDSON: BENEATH THE ROSES Narrative and theatrical craft have overtaken art and visual form in these dreary mural-size color photographs, which are so freighted with props, contrivances and omens, and so monotonously joyless that their sense of foreboding turns into parody. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street (212)206-6100 through June 18. (Smith)    JASPER JOHNS: CATENARY Paintings and drawings less mandarin in their personal iconography only by comparison with the clotted art of the 1980's and 90's. There is a series of stupendously beautiful prints. The redeeming through line is touch, whose eloquence nearly salvages the works from their own oppressive claustrophobia. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)243-0200, through June 25. (Kimmelman)    RINKO KAWAUCHI : AILA AND THE EYES, THE EARS In her second New York show this young Japanese photographer is showing large pale close-ups of natural phenomenon -- fish eggs, dead chickens, a hatching bird -- reminding us with oddly visionary effects that life's big themes are in the details. Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 206-8711, through June 18. (Smith)    * NEO RAUCH In his familiar and fashionable vein, mixing Pop, Surrealism, Socialist Realism and a stew of 19th-century sources, these latest paintings are more tours de force of labor and oddball design, chilly and sophisticated. The work is operating at a level where the air is thin and cold. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212)727-2070, through June 18. (Kimmelman)    'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)    JEFF SONHOUSE: 'THE PANOPTIC CON' As sharp visually as they are politically, Mr. Sonhouse's compact, finely painted Pop-Surrealist portraits depict masked African American men in colorful tuxedos with hair made of real matches, steel wool and other materials. In some, subjects are shown twice, mug shot style: face-forward and in profile. These slyly incendiary works probe the mystique of the mythic scary-sexy black dude. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through June 18. (Johnson)    STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotumlike coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through June 18. (Johnson)    HIROSHI SUGIMOTO Photographs of antique mathematical and mechanical models, evoking Brancusi, Arp and Man Ray, turning their subjects into big-screen cinematic presences, curvaceous and potent. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212)627-1018, through June 25. (Kimmelman)    HIROSHI SUGITO AND ROSILINE LUDUVICO The Japan-based Mr. Sugito and the Germany-based Ms. Luduvico bring compatible sensibilities to this dual show. Painted with wispy delicacy, her small pictures of people in the woods conjure sweet, sad moods. His most imposing painting, a large luminous field of patchy green punctuated by little butterflies, projects a vigorously sensuousness fantasy of pastoral bliss. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212)243-3335, through June 18. (Johnson)    TIP TOLAND: 'CYCLE OF LIFE' Comically humane and technically impressive painted clay sculptures by this West Coast ceramicist include a life-size, nude, octogenarian lady in a sexy, standing pose and twin, gray-haired women realized with remarkable realism from the waist up performing a whistling duet. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212)242-3013, through June 30. (Johnson)    KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)    JEAN CLAUDE WOUTERS: 'PORTRAITS & NUDES -- SPIRIT' Through a process of re-photographing his prints, this French artist creates large, black-and-white photographs that are so pale it may take a second to see the ghostly image of a nude torso or, more hauntingly, the larger than life face that seems to gaze at us from an ethereal realm. Meyerowitz, 120 Eleventh Avenue, at 20th Street, (212)414-2770, through June 18. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    * MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    * 'ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25.(Johnson)    CORNELIA FOSS Graceful, mature, modest paintings full of light and a subtle geometry: views of the beaches and salt marshes on Long Island and of Central Park. DFN Gallery,176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through June 18. (Kimmelman)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    * JULIO GONZÁLEZ This small but illuminating, 43-piece exhibition surveys the career of a sculptor who, late in life, taught Picasso how to work with metal and then went on in the 1930's to create playful, Cubist-style, welded iron assemblages that transformed modern sculpture. Instituto Cervantes, 211 East 49th Street, Turtle Bay, (212)308-7720, through June 18. (Johnson)    JACQUELINE HUMPHRIES Gestural abstractions made with fluorescent paint, lighted by black lights, campy and eloquent. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)995-1785, through June 18. (Kimmelman)    MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)    MALCOM MORLEY: THE ART OF PAINTING After 30 years, Malcolm Morley returns to the Photo Realist painting style he helped found in the mid 1960's, further exploring the tensions between reality, the art of painting and the act of looking and demonstrating that fidelity, taken far enough, turns into something else. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)999-7337, through June 25. (Smith)    Last Chance    ANTHONY CARO Four tabletop pieces from the 1970's and 80's, masterly exercises in balletic form and balance in rusting steel, by this reigning British standard-bearer of modernist abstract sculpture. They are elegant and a serious pleasure. Mitchell-Inness & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, closing tomorrow.(Kimmelman)    TOM PHILLIPS The New York debut of a polymath British artist, well into his 60's, whose small, mosaiclike collages reconfigure the narrative, and the pages, of a Victorian novel while doing something new with cut-up comic books. Flowers, 1000 Madison, near 78th Street, (212)212 430-1700, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    * AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous, dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations of texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    * RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, closing on Thursday.

Previews and Openings    'SCREEN PLAY' Opens tomorrow. Liberal paranoia runs wild in A.R.

'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Opens June 15. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Renew that old debate at Tom Donaghy's new adaptation of Chekhov's last play (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' Opens June 16. When a wife discovers that her husband is cheating with her best friend, she takes unusual measures. Roundabout's revival of Somerset Maugham's comedy of manners stars Kate Burton and Lynn Redgrave (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300.    'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens June 16. . The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show. David Warren directs (1:25). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.    'FASTER' Previews start Tuesday. Opens June 12. Inspired by James Gleick's bestselling book, this lightning fast production follows three young people speeding through life (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street (212) 279-4200.    'MANUSCRIPT' Opens June 12. A manuscript holds the key to success and fame in Paul Grellong's comedy, directed by Bob Balaban (2:00).

'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Previews start Thursday. Opens June 14. Procrastinators around the world despise Alan Acykbourn, the English writer whose 67th play receives its New York premiere. A bittersweet comedy about six lonely Londoners trying to connect (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and on-stage alterego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. (Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BFE' Julia Cho's insightful drama about the agonies and comforts of isolation centers around a 14-year-old Asian-American girl (Olivia Oguma) who feels she isn't beautiful. The main characters force themselves to reach out to others, but all fail in some essential way (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Anita Gates)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444.(Jason Zinoman)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Reopening Thursday at the Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.(Neil Genzlinger)    'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Oliver Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce Irish (2:30). Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. In repertory with ''Score.'' (Anne Midgette)    'TABLOID CALIGULA' Three excellent performances set off Darren Murphy's dark comedy, about a London thug hooked on Alexander the Great, in which the author has a lot of fun with language and the art of storytelling (1:30). Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200.(Andrea Stevens)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Preyskyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Citigroup Center, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444.(Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters, affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, (212)239-6200. (Gates)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'DAY IN THE LIFE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE' Talent and passion are overcome by banality in the first musical by the Broadway actor Josh Walden, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, choreographed the show, and directed. While the music and dance show occasional flair, the same cannot be said of the lyrics or book, a clichéd exhuming of the secrets behind 1950's facades (1:00) . Flamboyan Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4080. (Horn)    'KNOCK ON WOOD' Thanks to Steven Spielberg and Bob Dole, the bar is fairly high these days for war stories, and Samuel Calderon comes nowhere near clearing it with ''Knock on Wood,'' a monologue about his perfectly ordinary service in the Israeli military during the Yom Kippur War. He sees a few moderately distressing sights, his friend is injured, and that's about it (1:30). 13th Street Repertory, 50 West 13th Street, (212)352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES A' A long, too often dreary evening of plays by a pair of Tony winners, John Guare and Warren Leight, and a pair of actress-playwrights, Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros and Leslie Lyles. Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros contribution, ''The Airport Play,'' is the briefest and, perhaps not coincidentally, the best of the bunch (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212)352-3101 (Isherwood)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10).

(Brantley)    Last Chance    'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about a girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking play (starring Tim Daly), but unfortunately, there are no characters in it you can believe in. Loosely based on a true story, this timely drama is about a girl who has been in a coma for several years and her brother who plans to disconnect her breathing ventilator and allow her to die (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'IVANOV' Jonathan Banks staging of the Chekhov classic Ivanov with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 17 Lexington Avenue, at 23rd street, (646)312-4085, closing tomorrow. (Jonathan Kalb)    'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the pair (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'MORTAL LADIES POSSESSED' Linda Marlowe's admirable but difficult one-woman show is based on a 1974 collection of Tennessee Williams's short stories. The adaptation is sometimes awkward and the transitions hard to follow, but she captures the characters' pathos and fragility nicely (1:20). 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    * 'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics is badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer, Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, closing on Thursday. The show is in repertory with ''Songs From an Unmade Bed.'' (Midgette)    'UNCLE JIMMY'S DIRTY BASEMENT' This strange brew of Catskills humor, heavy metal and filthy-minded puppets has developed a cult following downtown, and its bizarre band rocks out to some of the most bombastically silly songs since Spinal Tap's ''Big Bottom.'' But when the music stops, the show meanders without an involving story (1:15). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)477-5288, closing tomorrow.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DOMINION PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST' (R, 115 minutes) The solemn, high-minded attempt to redeem ''The Exorcist'' franchise is the movie equivalent of retrieving the eggshells, coffee grounds and banana peels from the trash and presenting them as art; the ingredients still stink. (Holden)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creep show, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)    'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in. (Dargis)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SAVING FACE' (R, 91 minutes) The amiable romantic comedy examines the lives of three generations of Chinese-Americans living in New York exudes a palpable love for its characters but ends up betraying its hard-headedness with instant, feel-good solutions to their problems. (Holden)    'SEQUINS' (No rating, 88 minutes, in French) In this decorous trifle from France, the young actress Lola Naymark stares into space with moist, empty eyes, tossing her red hair like a pony fretfully swishing away late-summer flies. Ms. Naymark's enviable hair, with its springy curls and poetically inflamed color, accounts for much of this film's visual enchantment and interest. (Dargis)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    * 'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Dana Stevens)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity.

(Jon Pareles)    BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA (Monday) After more than 60 years as a group, the Blind Boys of Alabama are no longer boys, but gray-haired eminences of gospel quartet singing.

(Pareles)    BLANCHE (Thursday) This Detroit band's debut single featured the White Stripes frontman Jack White (who also covered a Blanche song as a B-side to his single ''I Don't Know What To Do With Myself''). Both bands share an idealization of a pre-modern sound. Blanche's acoustic goth Americana meanders the foothills of an imagined Appalachia. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $12. (Laura Sinagra)    BLUE MERLE (Wednesday) This Nashville group's folk-rock is best when it opens into jam-band expanse. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, $12, $14 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE CORAL (Thursday) This British band's psychedelic pop has yet to find the glorious meeting of newfound structure and early chaos it would need to take listeners by storm. Still, the amiable lads seem to be gesturing toward trendy punk-disco these days, which isn't a bad move . 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $16, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)    COWBOY JUNKIES (Tomorrow) Nearing the 20-year mark, this soporific alt-country group nurtures a base of vaguely alienatied yuppy fans still intrigued by the band's relatively safe journey to country's dark side, and the sibling tension between its singer, Margo Timmins, and her guitarist and songwriter brother, Michael. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $35. (Sinagra)    ROBERT CRAY BAND AND MARCIA BALL AND JEREMIAH LOCKWOOD ((Tonight) Robert Cray, who brings convincing passion to songs about a tortured conscience, meshes blues with Memphis soul.

(Pareles)    DICK DALE (Tomorrow) Dick Dale, king of the surf guitar, provides no polite nostalgia trip to the mid-1960's. He's out to summon elemental forces with the stomping beat of his band and his heavily reverbed, brusquely attacked guitar lines, along with the dive-bombing, tremolo glissandos that literally melt his guitar picks from the heat of their friction on the strings. 7 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144, $20.50, $25.50 at the door.

(Pareles)    ELECTRELANE (Tonight) The spacey European art-pop favored by this British band, played on vintage analog equipment and influenced by 1970's German electronic rock, hasn't been in vogue since the late 90's, but the group plays it with verve, often subverting its music's sheen with messy garage-rock heft. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $15. (Sinagra)    JOHN FOGERTY (Wednesday) The Creedence Clearwater Revival's songwriter, guitarist and singer's wild-eyed wail and the distilled twang of his guitar remain undiminished, the sound of a mythic backwoods Southland where barefoot girls dance in the moonlight. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $75. (Pareles)    THE FUTUREHEADS, HIGH SPEED SCENE, PITTY SING (Monday) Vying with Bloc Party for the mantle of least derivative dance-punk revival band, the Futureheads' reverence for the music of polestars like XTC and Wire extends beyond sonic mimicry, adding nuance to pro forma punk panic. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $20. (Sinagra)    THE FUNKY METERS (Tonight and Thursday) The Funky Meters include Art Neville on keyboards and George Porter Jr. on bass from the Meters, the band that was the cornerstone of New Orleans funk.

(Sinagra)    GRÁDA (Wednesday) Though they play their guitars, fiddles, flutes and bodhrans in the traditional Celtic style, this young Dublin group has set itself apart by composing original music, innovating on Irish, Breton and Eastern Eurpoean styes while staying recognizably within the forms. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26 Street,Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $15, $18 at the door.

Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10. (Pareles)    JURASSIC 5 (Tuesday) Reaching back to rap's old school era of simple funky beats and sing-along choruses, this nostalgic California group was popular in the late-90's when hip-hop fans tired of Puff Daddy's sampling of whole songs and mainstream rap's increasingly money-grubbing aesthetic. 11 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $25.50, $27 at the door. (Sinagra)    KEANE AND REGINA SPEKTOR (Tuesday) Keane is a piano-drums-vocals band that piles on one hooky melodic flourish after another as if to distance ifself from the artiness of its main influence, Radiohead. The music of the bill's opener, The Russian-born singer-pianist Regina Spektor, goes down less smoothly, bringing punk immediacy into a caberet setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and unhinged melodrama. 7:30 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, (212)465-6741, $39.50 and $29.50. (Sinagra)    KEREN ANN (Thursday) This Dutch-Javanese, Russian-Israeli chanteuse Keren Ann applies her velvety voice to jazz-inflected, rainy day urban valentines. Her lolling shows that the strongest memory of a visited place is often the homesickness endured there. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236, $13, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE KILLERS, LOUIS XIV (Tomorrow) Maybe it's their Las Vegas roots, maybe it's the singer Brendan Flowers' glam charisma or maybe its their simple nostalgic perference for the MTV version of the 80's over their peers' more complicated recollections. Whatever the reason, the Killers are the pop smash of the neo-New Wave boomlet. 5:30 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, $32.50, $35. Sold out.(Sinagra)    AMOS LEE (Tomorrow) After touring extensively with the like-minded Norah Jones, this Philadelphia singer-songwriter now headlines in support of his new album of soothing acoustic folk-soul ruminations. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    LOSERS LOUNGE: THE CURE VS THE SMITHS (Tonight and Tomorrow) A true treasure, the city's tireless pop tribute outfit takes advantage of the current post-punk revival and ongoing adoration of the mope-rock heros Morrissey and Robert Smith, both of whom offer endless options for loving parody and stylistic license. 8 p.m. and 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132, $17, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    LUCERO (Tuesday) The Arkansan Jim Nichols's convincingly weathered singing, an earthy growl that fits nicely in the groove of his band's wistful, ragged road rock. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $13, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    STEPHEN MALKMUS (Tuesday) The abstract poetic songwriting and quirky, blazing guitar work of the former Pavement frontman are still worth checking out. Recent work has increasingly seemed geared for cultists, while moving closer to universal topics like family, aging and commitment. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, East Village, (212)777-6800, $22.50, $25 at the door. Sold out. (Sinagra)    MARAH WITH NICK HORNBY (Sunday) Marah's articulate songs are doused in greasy, sweaty, exuberant rock.

The clever Philadelphia hip-hop producer Diplo is responsible for her popular underground mix ''Piracy Funds Terrorism'' (Hollertronix), which lays her vocals on music as diverse as 80's new wave and Brazillian baille funk. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20. Sold out. (Sinagra)    RAUL MIDÓN (Tuesday) Raul Midón's percussive guitar syncopations and supple, high-flying tenor, both akin to Jose Feliciano's style, have wowed audiences in his regular Joe's Pub appearances. His debut album, ''State of Mind'' (Manhattan), shifts the focus to his thoroughly earnest, positive-thinking songs, 7:30; Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8777 or (212)239-6200, $15. (Pareles)    JUANA MOLINA (Thursday) The reveries of this Argentinean songwriter stem from her acoustic guitar picking, her hushed voice, melodies with the simplicity of lullabies and rustling synthesizer backdrops that fill the songs with mystery. 9:30 Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8777, $15. (Pareles)    TRAVIS MORRISON (Sunday) This singer-guitarist's former band, the Dismemberment Plan, played virtuoso fusion-rock. Its transcendent quality was the anguished, cutesy break-up lyrics, written and sung, by Mr. Morrison. Though artier and more pretentious on his own, he manages to remain winsome. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10. (Sinagra)    STEVIE NICKS AND DON HENLEY (Tomorrow) Most will come out to this show to see the Fleetwood Mac star Stevie Nicks, who continues to fascinate though her vocal range has narrowed, edging those rich lows into raspier territory. One assumes that she and Don Henley of Eagles fame will perform their hit 80's duet ''Leather and Lace.'' 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., Garden State Parkway Exit 116, (732)335-0400, $26 to $126. (Sinagra)    OLD 97'S, BOBBY BARE JR. (Thursday) Having grown out of their smart-aleck phase long ago, the Old 97's were swerving toward slickness before to their latest release. The songwriter Rhett Miller is still writing near-genius tunes though he often resorts to mere craft. The Nashville songwriter Bobby Bare Jr. shares the bill. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, East Village, (212) 777-6800, $25.(Sinagra)    KELLY OSBOURNE (Monday) As Kelly Osbourne charts her route from reality television to the Broadway stage , she stops off to release another pop album, this time working with the popular song-doctor Linda Perry, who has worked with everyone from Pink to Fischerspooner.

(Sinagra)    GRAHAM PARKER & THE FIGGS (Tonight) Emerging from England just before the arrival of punk-rock, Graham Parker used the sturdy structures of soul and 1960's rock as he spat out angry, articulate songs that chafed against dishonesties large and small. These days, he's less furious and more cranky, but he's still holding the world around him to high standards. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $20. (Pareles)    SAM PREKOP (Tonight) One of the Chicago musicians who pioneered mid-90's jazz and electroinc post-rock music, the singer and guitarist Prekop is a smooth, if overly genteel singer, and fluid player. His group The Sea and Cake benefited from his light touch, and wistful vocals. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)    IKE REILLY (Sunday) This St. Paul rocker's visceral, outlandishly catchy 2001 album, ''Salesman and Racists'' (Universal), captured a certain kind of in-the-cups cockiness and bar-clown wit that almost made the listener overlook its macho nudges and winks. Mr. Reilly and his band tear it up live. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)    DUKE ROBILLARD (Tomorrow) Duke Robillard, a guitarist and singer, founded Roomful of Blues in 1967, and in his solo career since leaving the band he hasn't forgotten the suave swing of vintage jump blues; he also played lead guitar on Bob Dylan's album ''Time Out of Mind.'' 7:30; Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155, $18, $22 tomorrow. (Pareles)    * URSULA RUCKER (Tonight) Ursula Rucker has been the poet on call for Philadelphians like the Roots.

(Pareles)    XAVIER RUDD (Monday) An Australian songwriter who has been working the jam-band circuit, Xavier Rudd plays jazzy, syncopated guitar as he broods, something like Dave Matthews with an occasional toot of a didjeridu. 8:00 p.m., with Kyle Riabko opening.

(Pareles)    SPOON, THE CLIENTELE (Wednesday and Thursday) The Austin indie standout Brit Daniels's latest album, ''Gimme Fiction'' (Merge), is a tougher nut to crack than 2002's nearly flawless jitter-rock ''Kill the Moonlight'' (Merge), but live his tight group listens to each other, as the vibe swings from slacker angst to caffeinated bravado. 7 p.m., Webster Hall,125 East 11th Street, East Village, (917)577-2499, $18, $20 at the door. Sold out. (Sinagra)    WOLF PARADE, RICK MOODY VS.

Sold out (Sinagra)    LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III (Sunday and Monday) Mr. Wainwright has had topical songs commissioned by NPR in the past, but he saves his sharpest barbs for himself, confronting middle age and mortality without letting himself off the hook.

This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades.

(Glueck)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)     MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals.

Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Smith)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    * QUEEN SOFíA SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Núñez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquín Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI: 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)    * STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    ANTHONY CARO Four tabletop pieces from the 1970's and 80's, masterly exercises in balletic form and balance in rusting steel, by this reigning British standard-bearer of modernist abstract sculpture. They are elegant and a serious pleasure. Mitchell-Inness & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. (Kimmelman)    GEORGE CONDO His latest sculptures are gnarly heads and busts, vehemently modeled in clay and cast in gaudy gold bronze, that bring the droll nastiness and lush physicality of his more satirical paintings fully into three dimensions. Skarstedt Fine Art, 980 Madison near 78th Street, (212)737-2060, through June 10. (Smith)    HUBERTUS GOJOWCZYK: 'THE BOOK AS OBJECT' If Joseph Cornell had been a librarian, he might have produced sculptures like the fantastically altered books that this Polish artist creates. Glass eyes stare out from the pages of one old tome; the corner of another morphs into a waxy brain. Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through June 24. (Johnson)    * RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson)    EMILY NELLIGAN AND MARVIN BILECK: 'CRANBERRY ISLAND, DRAWINGS AND PRINTS' Using only charcoal and eraser on ordinary letter paper, Emily Nelligan has for more than 50 years focused on a tiny part of Maine called Great Cranberry Island, one of several specks off the coast near Mount Desert. Restricting her palette to reticent blacks, whites and grays, she conveys the spirit, changes and constancies of a pure, unsullied wilderness. Marvin Bileck, her husband, has concentrated on the island's factual here-and-nowness, rendering piled-up rocks, tangles of trees, deep woods and their tweakings by nature in meticulous drawings and etchings. She's a wizard at mood, he's a master of specifics. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, through June 17. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)    SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through June 25. (Johnson)    ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)    NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree branches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)    RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by the influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through June 18. (Johnson)    'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)    JEFF SONHOUSE: 'THE PANOPTIC CON' As sharp visually as they are politically, Mr. Sonhouse's compact, finely painted Pop-Surrealist portraits depict masked African American men in colorful tuxedos with hair made of real matches, steel wool and other materials. In some, subjects are shown twice, mug shot style: face-forward and in profile. These slyly incendiary works probe the mystique of the mythic scary-sexy black dude. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through June 18. (Johnson)    STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotum-like coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through June 18. (Johnson)    KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)    JEAN CLAUDE WOUTERS: 'PORTRAITS & NUDES -- SPIRIT' Through a process of re-photographing his prints, this French artist creates large, black and white photographs that are so pale it may take a second to see the ghostly image of a nude torso or, more hauntingly, the larger than life face that seems to gaze at us from an ethereal realm. Meyerowitz, 120 Eleventh Avenue, at 20th Street, (212)414-2770, through June 18. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    * MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a recreation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    * 'ALBERT0 CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25. (Johnson)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    * JULIO GONZÁLEZ This small but illuminating, 43-piece exhibition surveys the career of a sculptor who, late in life, taught Picasso how to work with metal and then went on in the 1930s to create playful, Cubist-style, welded iron assemblages that transformed modern sculpture. Instituto Cervantes, 211 East 49th Street, (212)308-7720, through June 18. (Johnson)    JUDY LEDGERWOOD: 'SPRING FEVER' With a boldly insouciant touch and vibrantly dissonant colors, this Chicago-based artist makes grid-based pattern paintings using heraldic overtones and punchy mandala compositions of squished balloonlike shapes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)229-2757, through June 24. (Johnson)    MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)    MALCOM MORLEY: THE ART OF PAINTING After 30 years, Malcolm Morley returns to the Photo Realist painting style he helped found in the mid 1960s, further exploring the tensions between reality, the art of painting and the act of looking and demonstrating that fidelity, taken far enough, turns into something else. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, Meatpacking District, (212)999-7337, through June 25. (Smith)    * AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous, dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations of texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)    Last Chance    * ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE.' A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'CHERISHED POSSESSIONS.' More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, historic New England, from a box with two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait. Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000, closing on Sunday. (Glueck)    TINA BARNEY The photographer known for her large, sumptuous color photographs of rich people often caught in situations of subtle psychological tension presents portraits shot in Spain and Germany that are included in her book ''The Europeans.'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212)431-0166, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT' Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short, innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-3583, closing tomorrow. through June 4. (Smith)    * WYNNE GREENWOOD AND K8 HARDY Wynne Greenwood is best known as the one-person rock trio called Tracy and the Plastics. K8 Hardy is a founder of the gay feminist art collective LTTR. For this show, they collaborated on a video called ''New Report'' in which they play anchorwomen for an alternative television news channel. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering, 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK' The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture, and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, closing on Sunday. (Johnson)    REUBEN NAKIAN: 'TERRA COTTAS, 1955-1983' The large semi-figurative bronze sculptures of Nakian (1897-1983) often figure in the history of Abstract Expressionism, but this well-selected exhibition suggests that he should be best remembered for his small terra cottas -- fraught with Classical themes, sexual energy and fast-working bravura. Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212)752-1223, closing tonight. (Smith)    * 'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    LARRY RIVERS Boldly setting up as a figural painter in the holy days of Abstract Expressionism, Rivers (1923-2002) early on produced portraits, nudes and takeoffs on historical events. This bulging retrospective covers work from the early 1950's to his death, ending with the rather forgettable fashion images of his last years. At his best, he was a painter to reckon with. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212)541-4900; Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212)463-8634, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)    AIDA RUILOVA: 'LETS GO' A participant in the last Whitney Biennial and P.S. 1's current ''Greater New York,'' Ms. Ruilova makes short and briefly gripping multi-screen video works in a style you might call Neo-Goth Surrealistic Cubism. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)445-0444, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, closing tomorrow.
