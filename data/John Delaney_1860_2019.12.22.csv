We learned wisdom, passion, integrity, and ''tikkun olam'' by following his example. His remarkable legacy will remain with us forever. The Preston Robert Tisch Family   TISCH--Laurence A. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of our distinguished former national president, Laurence A. Tisch. Mr. Tisch demonstrated his devotion to the ATS, the Technion and Israel by serving as president in 1972 and 1973, having served as vice president of the Society in 1968. During his tenure, he encouraged visionary developments during a time of economic retrenchment following the Yom Kippur War. The Technion Faculty of Medicine was officially merged with the university, making the Technion one of the very few technological and scientific universities in the world with a medical school. The Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology, a leading Israeli think tank, began to take shape under Mr. Tisch's leadership. The first Harvey Prizes, which became internationally recognized awards for scientific achievement, were bestowed during his tenure. A member of the Technion International Board of Governors, Mr. Tisch established the Tisch Student Aid Fund to provide scholarships and fellowships for Technion students. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1989 at a major event chaired by Henry Taub, chairman of the Technion International Board of Governors, during which Mr. Tisch was lauded by former New York State Governor Mario Cuomo. Mr. Tisch's dedicated leadership, which served as a model of Jewish and educational philanthropy, will be missed. We extend our condolences to his wife Billie, brother Preston Robert, his sons Andrew, Dan, James and Tom, and the entire Tisch family. The American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A. Laser, President Evelyn Berger, Chairman, Board of Directors Melvyn H.

Chairman, International Board of Governors   TISCH--Laurence A. The Trustees and the entire University of Pennsylvania community are saddened by the death of alumnus and former Trustee, Laurence A. Tisch. A graduate of the Wharton School with a master's degree in industrial management, he was a recipient of Wharton's Gold Medal and the Joseph Wharton Award. Legendary within American higher education for his philanthropy, he generously supported The Wharton School's Campaign for Sustained Leadership. His living legacy at Penn extends to three generations with son James an MBA graduate from Wharton; son Andrew the father of Alexander, C'00, and Lacey C'03; and son Daniel the father of David, C'03, and Michael, C'06. Laurence Tisch demonstrated extraordinary leadership as a businessman, volunteer, and philanthropist. He will be dearly missed by his many friends in the Penn community. We extend the University's heartfelt condolences to his widow, Billie, and all the members of his family. May his memory be a blessing. Judith Rodin, President James S.

The Academy extends its condolences to his wife, Billie; his brother, Bob; and the entire Tisch family. Patricia Meyer Spacks, President Leslie Berlowitz, Executive Officer Louis Cabot, Vice President Emilio Bizzi, Secretary John S. Reed, Treasurer   TISCH--Laurence A. ''Words without deeds are nothing. One must show by way of example.'' David Ben-Gurion said these words and Laurence Tisch lived them.
