BEN BRANTLEY    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Is there room on Broadway for another odd couple of singing con men? On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' directed by Jack O'Brien and starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a queasy slouch. Though shot through a rowdy spirit of self-parody, the show (with songs by David Yazbek) seems to believe in its own brazen agenda only when the criminally talented Mr. Butz commands the stage. (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $41.25 to $101. 25.  BRANTLEY    ++* 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    'AFTER ASHLEY' If the last two hours of Gina Gionfriddo's play were as fine as the first 15 minutes, we'd have something to cheer. But the spark of interest ignited by the fresh first scene, a disarming and funny heart-to-heart between a confused mother and her teenage son, is all but extinguished by the time this finger-wagging satire has concluded. Ms. Gionfriddo's target is America's taste for blood, and its tabloid-tinged, sex-crime-addicted popular media. Despite some fine work from Anna Paquin and particularly Kieran Culkin, the director Terry Kinney's production is sabotaged by the conflicting impulses in the writing (2:15). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    +* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion. Staking no claim to artistic significance, it makes a nice sound, looks pretty (if you like pretty boys) and sends you home with a smile. The show comprises a dozen sly parodies cooked up by the skilled songwriters Gary Adler and Michael Patrick Walker, with winking choruses like, ''Girl, you make me want to wait.'' All the guys have terrific voices and nimble limbs, and each gets a moment to linger in the solo spotlight. (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $66 to $69.  ISHERWOOD    ++'ENDGAME' Tony Roberts, the actor often used by Woody Allen to epitomize suave charm in contrast to his own hapless shlubbery, moves into new territory as Hamm in this middling revival of Samuel Beckett's caustic comedy about man's fumbling reckoning with extinction. Mr. Roberts's urbanity is naturally translated into Hamm's imperiousness. But this production is sharper at etching the play's mordant humor than outlining the heaving shoals of dread on which it should rest. Nevertheless, it's also notable for the performance of Alvin Epstein, a superlative Beckett interpreter, as Nagg (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212)727-2737. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $50.  ISHERWOOD    'GHETTO SUPERSTAR (THE MAN THAT I AM)' Midway through this musical autobiography, Billy Porter describes the moment that changed his life: His teenage encounter, via the Tony Awards telecast, with Jennifer Holliday's galvanizing performance of ''And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.'' Those emotions play roles in this unabashedly sentimental show, but they ultimately take a back seat to righteous flamboyance. The hallmarks of Mr. Porter's personal history will not be revelations to theatergoers who have accompanied other gay men in the performing arts on similar journeys through shame and confusion to self-acceptance. But Mr. Porter's performance of various pop songs, show tunes and original compositions is vibrant and enjoyable. (1:40). Public Theater, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Thursday through Monday at 7 p.m.; Saturday matinee at 2. Tickets: $45.  ISHERWOOD    'HIDING BEHIND COMETS' The dynamics of the guy-walks-into-a-bar play are tricky. Inject a set of twins into the mix, as Brian Dykstra does in his play, and you've pretty much doomed the venture. In fiction they too often seem like a cheap gimmick. The twins here are a male-female pair, 20-somethings named Troy (Robert Mollohan) and Honey (Moira MacDonald). They mind their father's dingy bar. The stranger who intrudes is Cole (Dan Moran), an elliptical older fellow with a temper. After much verbal sparring, and a lot of sex talk that isn't very sexy, the point emerges: Cole was supposedly at Jonestown during the mass suicide there in 1978, and he has dropped by the bar to force Honey and Troy to rethink their parentage. Mr. Dykstra's script sounds as if it's banking on the shock value of Jonestown, hoping that the audience, like the idiot twins on the stage, will not have heard of it. Way too early for that (1:45). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, (212)868-4444. Thursdays through Mondays at 8 p.m.; matinee on Saturday at 3. Tickets: $35; $40 for Fridays and Saturday evenings.  NEIL GENZLINGER    * 'HOUSE/LIGHTS' The Wooster Group made the right choice when it selected ''House/Lights'' to embody its three decades of work. This technically dazzling production, based on a Gertrude Stein libretto, uses simulcast video monitors and voice-layering synthesizers to spin everything that is said and done into an orbit of multiple effects. The effect is as exhilarating as it is disorienting, capturing the impact of technology-driven life in a way that flat film and computer imagery never can. The subject may be dehumanization, but the cast is among the most vital and theatrically disciplined you will ever see. (1:10) St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718)254-8779. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays; $37 Fridays through Sundays.  BRANTLEY    'I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE' The prolific British novelist J. B. Priestley was fascinated by the concept of time, and his play suggests that individuals repeat their life cycles until they break free from past mistakes. Based partly on the author's readings of the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky, the theory is described in the play by the mysterious German émigré Dr. Görtler. Dr. Görtler, like the five other characters at the Black Bull Inn on the moors of North Yorkshire in 1937, is a mechanical device for the working out of the Priestley-Ouspensky puzzle. And as demonstrated by the Pearl Theater Company cast, in what the troupe says is the first revival of the play in New York since it appeared on Broadway in 1938, where it flopped, there isn't much wiggle room when you are a device instead of a character. Symbolism aside, the pleasure of the evening is in watching the players move about with easy familiarity (all have worked together before at the Pearl), under Gus Kaikkonen's direction, on the snug, rose-colored set by Takeshi Kata, with its four clocks that tick and chime at melodramatic moments. (2:30) Pearl Theater Company, Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $50.  ANDREA STEVENS    +'INKY' Beware the nanny with bruised knuckles. That's the only cogent conclusion to draw from Rinne Groff's peculiar and unfocused comedy about the competitive ethics of the 1980's. The title is the odd nickname for the odd main character, a Manhattan au pair obsessed with Muhammad Ali. Inky is played by a talented newcomer to the New York stage, Jessi Campbell. The play traces her influence on her employers, a harried young businessman and his demanding wife. Unfortunately, Ms. Groff is too vague in her use of boxing symbolism, and too loose in her observation of character, for her ideas about the aridity of the rat race to hit home (1:20). Women's Project, at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $47.  ISHERWOOD    'THE LAST DAYS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT' This latest work from the author of ''Jesus Hopped the A Train'' brings to mind an unusually lively senior-class project. Thank heaven -- a subject much discussed in this debate of a drama about the Bible's most famous betrayal -- that at least the person in charge is the class cutup. And that he is popular enough to recruit some really cool friends (including Eric Bogosian, Sam Rockwell and the show's director, Philip Seymour Hoffman). Still, the colorful vernacular speech and flashy performances can't disguise the impression that the play is a heavily footnoted position paper on a big, big subject (2:40) . Public Theater/Martinson Hall, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: Things will look a lot more impressive than they actually are if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind ''Lazer Vaudeville,'' a show with lots of color, not much substance and a future asterisk: it is the last production in the John Houseman Theater, slated for demolition. The show is a hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by Carter Brown, Cindy Marvell and Nicholas Flair, who are moderately engaging but don't seem to be having quite enough fun. Ms. Marvell is a first-class juggler and never disappoints, and there's a funny little hat fandango involving all three, but some of the men's bits and ensemble pieces don't have much wow factor. Perhaps the three know they are short on razzmatazz, because they constantly shut off the lights and let their glow-in-the-dark ropes and batons do the talking. It looks cool, but, left alone in the dark once too often, some may find themselves forced to admit, ''Doggone it, that's just a guy twirling a rope'' (1:30). John Houseman Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 11 a.m., 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $45.  GENZLINGER    +'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in the case of ''The Musical of Musicals!'' Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $56 to $59.50.  MARGO JEFFERSON    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success. Mr. Pendleton, an actor and acting teacher, reimagines this theatrical footnote as a quietly momentous turning point in the emotional and professional lives of everyone involved, including Olivier's outgoing and incoming wives, Vivien Leigh and Joan Plowright, and the critic Kenneth Tynan. While Mr. Pendleton smartly exploits the frailties of these graying artistic lions for comedy, there is an abiding respect and affection in his irreverence and in the fastidious performances of director David Cromer's fine cast (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: 55.  ISHERWOOD    'ROMANCE' Listen up, you mugs. Nobody makes fun of David Mamet, see, because David Mamet can take care of that all by hisself. In the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, Mr. Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either. Neil Pepe directs an irreproachable but ineffective cast that includes Larry Bryggman and Bob Balaban (1:35). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.  BRANTLEY    ++* 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories from the mid-19th century, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest. Directed by Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott, and featuring bizarrely beautiful songs by Martyn Jacques, ''Shockheaded Peter'' manages to wallow in and tear apart our enduring appetite for scaring ourselves. Though styled as a Victorian peep show, this British import makes contemporary self-spoofing horror exercises (like Wes Craven's ''Scream'' movies) look like, well, child's play (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Thursdays at 10 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $21.25 to $66.25.  BRANTLEY    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.  PHOEBE HOBAN    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45.  ISHERWOOD    +'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson and directed by Casey Childs, the play is gaudy and moderately fun, basically a big chunk of theatrical costume jewelry. It concentrates, as these borderline morbid celebrity showcases often do, on the declining arc of its subject's worldly career, and gives us the usual generous doses of dysfunction and despair beneath the glittering resume. Ms. Ruehl gives a vigorous, enjoyably big performance, but even her hard work can't inflate the flatter stretches in the writing (1:40). Promenade Theater, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25.  ISHERWOOD    Off Off Broadway    'GORILLA MAN' The usual afflictions befalling teenage boys -- acne, scuffed skateboards, the indifference of that girl in homeroom -- pale in comparison to the plight of Billy, the hero of this pop musical by Kyle Jarrow. Billy wakes one morning to find he is turning into a man-eating beast. Lonely and confused, he sets out to find the father who bequeathed him the genes that brought on this misfortune. On a deeper level, he seeks an answer to the profound question that has stumped philosophers, theologians and adolescents for at least a couple of millennia: ''Why me?'' There are many laughs in Mr. Jarrow's self-consciously silly book and well-tailored pop-rock songs, but the show's overall conception, which layers horror-movie melodramatics over a pseudo-earnest inquiry into questions of fate and free will, is ultimately juvenile (1:20). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Thursdays through Saturdays at 9 p.m.; Sundays at 6 p.m. Tickets: $15.  ISHERWOOD    'PENTECOST' The Barrow Group's inaugural production in its new theater couldn't be much more ambitious: the New York premiere of ''Pentecost,'' a 1994 drama by the British playwright David Edgar. Written in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the play tackles everything from the origin of Western Renaissance art to America's pop-cultural hegemony to hostage negotiations. The writing is engaging and the staging keeps things moving. It's too bad, though, that Mr. Edgar didn't just stick with revolutionizing art history rather than trying to revolutionize the world (2:45). Barrow Group Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Mondays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $40.  HOBAN    'PULLMAN, WA' This new avant-garde work by Young Jean Lee has the deadpan simplicity of the plays of Richard Maxwell and the awkward, secretly suffering angst of a teenage diarist working through an identity crisis. Artifice is the enemy. There are no props or set (outside of two chairs); the lights never change; and the costumes look like the clothes that the actors might have worn to the movies earlier in the day. The play begins when Pete Simpson, a dead-eyed and strangely hypnotic actor, walks onstage and tells the audience that he know how to live. Don't get your hopes up. The entire play could be seen as a send-up of the self-help industry, a dry comment on its tough love and easy answers. It will surely not win over many who are already skeptical about experimental theater. But while this is not a major work, it is an honest one that takes itself seriously -- and that is refreshing (1:00) . Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Thursdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $15.  JASON ZINOMAN    Last Chance    'A MAN'S BEST FRIEND' At the beginning of Jeffrey M. Jones's crackpot farce, ''A Man's Best Friend,'' a clown with white makeup smeared across his face nonchalantly walks onstage and asks the other five members of the cast, ''Do I smell?'' They all make faces as if the answer is obvious and then quickly exit. This is only the first joke of the evening, but it provides a very precise indicator of the brand of humor that you're in for during the 80 minutes of this juvenile comedy. Mr. Jones is constantly throwing new oddities into the mix, even if they don't serve any purpose. You may often find yourself wondering, what's the point of this scene? Best not to ask too many questions of this kind of show, which seems more determined to be wacky than anything else. Its style is somewhere between David Lindsay-Abaire's ''Fuddy Meers'' and a Coney Island sideshow. (1:20). Walker Space, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $15.  ZINOMAN    'A VERY NAUGHTY GREEK PLAY (UTOPIA PARKWAY)' How do you update a 2,400-year-old comedy? The Aquila Theater Company's answer: create a version of Aristophanes' ''Wasps'' that has some of the dumbness of ''Saturday Night Live'' and the zaniness of Monty Python, without being as funny as either. From rubber chickens to inflatable sex mannequins played like air guitars, the piece brings in an arsenal of comedy gags to drive home this story about a politically conservative father (named Kokkos, or ''Red'') and his liberal son Huakinthos (''Blue''), arguing over a political leader named Thamnos (''small, leafy shrub'' -- a Bush by any other name). It's a shame to see so much talent and energy expended for so slender a result. (1:25). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 5 and 9 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 and $45; $15 for stageside ''Greek Seats,'' from which audience participants are drawn.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. (It won five Oscars, including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett.) Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 1920's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BE COOL' Directed by F. Gary Gray. Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Christina Milian (PG-13, 112 minutes). In ''Be Cool,'' Mr. Travolta, wearing black and the glazed look of the overly pampered and chronically bored, returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in Barry Sonnenfeld's 1995 adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel ''Get Shorty.'' That movie arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction,'' a film that in turn owed a serviceable debt to Mr. Leonard's oeuvre. But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, largely propelled by Mr. Travolta's star presence and a screenplay from Scott Frank, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty, fueled by nothing more than the faintest of vapors left over from those earlier successes. The new film was written by Peter Steinfeld, whose draggy, generally unfunny screenplay packs in a lot of the same characters from the Leonard novel (the sequel to ''Get Shorty'') and too much of its overworked, conceptually anemic plot.  DARGIS    'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' Starring Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai. Directed by Gurinder Chadha (PG-13, 111 minutes). Because Ms. Chadha knows how to sell multiplex multiculturalism -- her last feature was ''Bend It Like Beckham'' -- the pitch for her new film probably ran something along the lines of: ''Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' recontextualized as a Bollywood musical (only shorter) and set against the backdrop of the new global economy.'' Whatever the case, the new film -- which transposes Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India, with layovers in swinging London and sunny Los Angeles -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. Think ''My Big Fat Sari Wedding'' tricked out with clumsy song-and-dance numbers and delivered with much finger-wagging about cultural tolerance. The kicker here being that the wagging finger belongs to the story's heroine, here called Lalita (Ms. Rai, radiantly beautiful but inert), and the object of her high-mindedness is none other than a wealthy American, Will Darcy (Mr. Henderson, just inert).  DARGIS    'CONSTANTINE' Starring Keanu Reeves. Directed by Francis Lawrence (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Mr. Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. He is John Constantine, who travels back and forth between our world and the one below, working as a kind of freelance border guard, sending stray demons back into the fiery depths. But something big is brewing, involving rebel angels, the son of Satan, and a whole lot of pseudo-biblical mumbo jumbo. Assisting Mr. Reeves are Rachel Weisz, as a Los Angeles police detective whose sister has jumped off a roof, and Shia LeBoeuf as an eager dabbler in the occult. Tilda Swinton is the angel Gabriel, doing a bit of slumming after boffo work in Milton's ''Paradise Lost.'' A.O.  SCOTT    'DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN' Starring Kimberly Elise, Tyler Perry and Cicely Tyson. Directed by Darren Grant. (PG-13, 116 minutes). This movie is so oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce. As the story of a cruelly abandoned wife's reascendance zigzags from soap opera to slapstick to church sermon and back, it goes from A to Z on the all-things-to-all-people meter: Cinderella meets Amos 'n' Andy in Sunday school, so to speak.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'DOWNFALL' Starring Bruno Ganz. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (No rating, 155 minutes; in German, with English subtitles). Mr. Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses around him, and the Red Army closes in. Surrounding him are his followers, some fanatically loyal, others wavering in the face of defeat, who must all play out the endgame of their ghastly world-historical project. Mr. Hirschsbiegel's film, taking place at the moment when the energies of Nazism turned from murder to suicide, is engrossing and well made, but it does not generate much feeling beyond a queasy, prurient fascination. Its most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it.  SCOTT    * 'GUNNER PALACE' Directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. (PG-13, 86 minutes). Mr. Tucker spent several months in late 2003 and early 2004 in Baghdad recording the lives and words of members of the Army's 2/3 Field Artillery division (known as the Gunners), who were living in an opulent, bomb-damaged palace that once belonged to Uday Hussein. The resulting film is raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. We accompany them on raids and patrols, witness their moments of leisure, and hear their own conflicted responses to their experiences, conveyed through jokes, video diaries, poems and hip-hop freestyling. Whatever your opinions of the war in Iraq, this film will provide a necessary jolt of confusion, which is the first step toward an unsentimental understanding of who the American troops are and what they face.  SCOTT    'HOSTAGE' Directed by Florent Siri. Starring Bruce Willis and Kevin Pollak (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Mr. Willis's fading career as an action hero. The star plays a former hostage negotiator who has exiled himself to a quiet southern California town after a botched standoff. He springs back into action when the cliff-hugging mansion of a crooked book-cooking corporate accountant (Mr. Pollak) is simultaneously invaded by a posse of teenage punks and by a S.W.A.T. team of high-tech gangsters. The fiery demolition of this architectural monstrosity in which the accountant lives with his two children is the only thing worth applauding in this mess of film.  HOLDEN    'IN MY COUNTRY' Directed by John Boorman. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of the high-minded but hopelessly wooden film that examines the public hearings conducted by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the late 1990's. At the hearings, victims of human rights abuse during Apartheid confronted the perpetrators in court, both sides seeking ''ubuntu,'' or forgiveness instead of revenge. Mr. Jackson is an American reporter who brings his own angry racial agenda to the hearings. The screenplay, by Ann Peacock, who adapted the story from Antjie Krog's memoir, ''Country of My Skull,'' makes the fatal mistake of turning characters into mouthpieces engaged in stiff, point-counterpoint moral debate.  HOLDEN    * 'INTIMATE STORIES' Directed by Carlos Sorin. Starring Javier Lombardo (not rated, 92 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The modest gem of Argentine film, set in Patagonia, conveys starkly and unemotionally what it really feels like to live in a wilderness with next to nothing. For the characters who wouldn't understand the concept of upward mobility, this is simply the way life is. The story interweaves vignettes of travelers from the same rural village bound for the provincial capital 200 miles away. One is an old man (Antonio Bendectis), who takes to the road to find his runaway dog; another is a single mother (Javiera Bravo) who becomes a contestant on a TV game show; the third (Mr. Lombardo); is a traveling salesman. The journey promises redemption to one, riches to another, and true love to a third.  HOLDEN    'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (NC-17, 90 minutes). It was the image seen -- cheered and jeered, canonized and demonized -- around the world. In 1972 Linda Lovelace, nee Linda Boreman, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat,'' played the role that would bequeath her a tawdry and lasting celebrity. With a single act of extreme fellatio, this dazed and often confused 23-year-old became a pinup for the party animal's sexual revolution and, in time, a martyr in the crusade against pornography. But as is clear from this lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary, Ms. Boreman was also little more than a pawn, an empty vessel for opportunists from both sides of the pornography divide. The documentary is a ''slam, bam, thank you, ma'am'' trifle of an entertainment, one strategically packaged for Generation A.D.D.  DARGIS    'THE JACKET' Directed by John Maybury. Starring Adrien Brody (R, 102 minutes). Mr. Brody plays Jack Starks, a soldier in the first Gulf War who survives a bullet wound to the head, fixes a pickup truck in Vermont, and is then sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. There, things get really weird, as a sinister doctor (Kris Kristofferson) straps him into a jacket and shoves him in a drawer, in the name of some misguided therapeutic ideal, or perhaps just because he is a sadistic brute. The drawer, or maybe the jacket, enables Jack to propel himself forward in time, where he meets Keira Knightley, playing a lonely, hard-drinking waitress. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks, and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. In his less hyperactive moments, Mr. Maybury is able to conjure a mood of tenderness and menace, and Mr. Brody's haunted intelligence goes nicely with Ms. Knightley's jumpy intensity. The picture starts out trying to be craftily clever and ends up artlessly dumb, which is to say that it improves as it goes along, sliding from jumped-up paranoia into squishy sentiment.  SCOTT    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004. (It won Oscars for best picture, best director for Mr. Eastwood, best actress for Ms. Swank and best supporting actor for Mr. Freeman.)  SCOTT    * 'MILLIONS' Directed by Danny Boyle. Starring Alex Etel (PG, 97 minutes). When it comes to making movies, Mr. Boyle is usually up to no good, which is something this visual stylist does with great ostentatious flair. Best known for ''Trainspotting,'' a grungy entertainment about the gleefully down and out, and for the shiver-filled zombie flick ''28 Days Later,'' Mr. Boyle is the sort of creative type in whom the milk of human kindness often seems to curdle rather than flow. Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves his stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. Pegged to a motherless child named Damian (Alex Etel, making a sensational debut), ''Millions'' is about the secret world of children, in particular that miraculous, tragically brief interlude when the young imagination -- not yet captive to crippling adult conventions like time, space and rational thought -- takes boundless flight.  DARGIS    'THE PACIFIER' Directed by Adam Shankman. Starring Vin Diesel (PG, 97 minutes). In the primary visual gag of ''The Pacifier,'' a Navy Seal, on a top-secret babysitting mission, retrofits his gun and grenade holders to keep baby formula and diapers at the ready. Despite the specter of boogeymen, Disney's new family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. As a special-ops warrior with a heart-thawing assignment, Mr. Diesel succeeds as a genre-switcher through the help of an able ensemble. The mayhem should delight kids, just as the imposed order will please parents. Anyone else, however, might feel as though they are, in Mr. Diesel's words, merely ''burning daylight.''  NED MARTEL    'ROBOTS' Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha. With the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and Robin Williams (PG, 89 minutes). Like so many other non-Pixar computer-animated family movies, this one, from Fox's Blue Sky Studios, runs on visual novelty and narrative familiarity. The setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination, as are the characters, an assortment of dented heroes and sleek, silvery villains. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions, cool soundtrack music and heartwarming lessons about being yourself and following your dreams. There is, it must be said, a certain honesty to the story, which suggests that recycled, second-hand junk is superior to the latest high-tech upgrades, a moral the movie at once upholds and refutes.  SCOTT    'UP AND DOWN' Starring Petr Forman and Emilia Vasaryova. Directed by Jan Hrebejk (R, 108 minutes; in Czech, with English subtitles). This engaging, unruly mix of comedy and melodrama follows the mood swings suggested by its title. Tracing the generally unhappy doings of a dozen or so loosely connected people in contemporary Prague, it skips from buoyant satire to domestic melodrama, leaving behind a curious mix of emotions. It is not often you see a movie so bracingly pessimistic about the human condition that dispenses its dose of bad news with such good cheer. A baby is illegally adopted by a former soccer hooligan; an émigré returns for a reunion with his broken family -- all in an atmosphere of petty crime, anxiety about immigration and general puzzlement at the state of the world (or at least the Czech Republic) -- 15 years after the end of Communism.  SCOTT    'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' Directed by Mike Binder. Starring Joan Allen, Kevin Costner, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Mr. Costner and Ms. Allen to do some marvelous work. Both performances are somewhat familiar: Mr. Costner, once again, is an athlete past his prime, and Ms. Allen is a brittle, unhappy suburban housewife, but the actors slip into their characters with ease and wit, and complement each other beautifully as they explore a haphazard friendship that turns into a love affair. The downside is that Mr. Binder does not give them enough of a dramatic context to work in, and undermines their efforts with a surprise ending that very nearly destroys the whole movie. Ms. Witt, Ms. Christensen, Ms. Wood and Ms. Russell play Ms. Allen's daughters, but their characters are as thinly conceived as figures in a television pilot, and it is hard to believe that the four of them and Ms. Allen add up to a family.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * AMORPHIS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. This Finnish band embraces a style some people call melodic death metal, matching gravelly vocals and (sometimes) whiplash tempos with big, often heroic melodies and precise guitar lines that evoke progressive rock. Sunday night at 7, with Beyond the Embrace, Into Eternity, Single Bullet Theory and With Passion; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 at the door.  KELEFA SANNEH    * DANIEL BELL, CABANNE, downstairs at Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. A minimalist dance party starring two DJ's who like their tracks stripped-down and twitchy. Mr. Bell, a longtime minimal techno producer, is known for his sleek but restless style, and for an excellent 2000 compilation, ''The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell'' (Tresor), a surprisingly warm disc full of precise party music. The 2003 follow-up was ''The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!''(Logistic), which included a pair of mischievous, rubbery tracks from Cabanne, a French producer and DJ who is also on tonight's bill. Tonight after 9, with Spinoza and Movement; admission is $5.  SANNEH    LIZ CARROLL AND JOHN DOYLE, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. Liz Carroll, one of the finest Celtic fiddlers in the United States, has won an All-Ireland fiddling championship as well as a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. She isn't afraid to let a little of the Celtic diaspora into her Irish fiddle tunes; touches of bluegrass technique put an American twinkle into the old jigs and reels. She has teamed up with the guitarist and singer John Doyle, formerly of the group Solas, who brings a deep Celtic flavor to the modal syncopation of his guitar and his finely ornamented singing. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $18 in advance, $20 tomorrow.  JON PARELES    CELTIC FIDDLE FESTIVAL/ROSHEEN, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. Celtic Fiddle Festival is a trans-Atlantic alliance with three fiddlers. Kevin Burke grew up in an Irish family in England and has become one of the most authoritative traditional Irish musicians alive, sweet and lightning-fast. Christian LeMaitre plays the Celtic music of Brittany, and Andre Brunet comes from the French Canadian group La Bottine Sourriante. They're accompanied by the guitarist Ged Foley. They share the bill with Rosheen, a seven-member Celtic group from Quebec started by the singer Lynn Valliéres, who sings in English and French. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $22.50 in advance, $25 tomorrow.  PARELES    EL GRAN COMBO, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, (212)239-2672. El Gran Combo was formed in 1962 and has been consistently on the Latin charts ever since. By now, it's an institution, still singing about matters close to the heart of Puerto Ricans on the island and far away. Tomorrow night, doors open at 10; admission is $25.  PARELES    * ODETTA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. Odetta has been a blues powerhouse since the 1950's, strumming hard and singing with a deep, leathery voice that harks back to field hollers and sprituals. She gives her songs the authority of archetypes. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $30.  PARELES    * OM, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. Matt Pike, formerly of the excellent slow-motion metal band Sleep, now leads his own loud and utterly hypnotic band High on Fire. The other two former Sleep members play together in OM, a bass-and-drums duo that celebrates its buzzy, bleary new album, ''Variations on a Theme'' (Holy Mountain), at this show -- the album consists solely of three long tracks, so expect a long, cyclical set. Tomorrow night at 7:30, with Hidden Hand and Unearthly Trance; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door.  SANNEH    OZRIC TENTACLES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. England has jam bands, too, and Ozric Tentacles may be the most well-traveled one of them. Its songs start with the suite-like complexities of progressive rock, and take off from there. Tomorrow night at 9, with Lotus opening; tickets are $20 in advance, $23 tomorrow.  PARELES    PSARANTONIS/HAINIDES ENSEMBLE, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536. This double bill of Greek music from Crete features, Psarantonis, the scion of a long line of musicians who has been making albums since 1964. He sings and plays the lyra--an upright, throaty-toned fiddle capable of fierce, danceable melodies or husky laments--and leads an ensemble that includes his daughter and two sons. Hainides, the group sharing the bill, is an ensemble of younger musicians who play both Cretan traditional music and music from across Greece. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $45, or $15 for students.  PARELES    TOSHI REAGON, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and her love of blues and funk to songs that address love and politics with the same sense of independence. With her band Big Lovely and, in a show to mark the imminent closing of Fez, unannounced guests. Tonight at 8; tickets are $15.  PARELES    LES SANS CULOTTES, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, (212)505-3733. The light-headed charm of the 1960's French rock known as ''ye-ye'' is concept enough for Les San Culottes, a Brooklyn band. Campiness is virtually built in to the fuzz-toned guitars, electric organ, cooing female voices and know-it-all male growls. Tomorrow night at 11:30, with Gaijin a Go Go at 10:30, the Dansettes at 9:30, Locksley at 8:30 and the New Rags at 7:30; admission is $8.  PARELES    CHRIS SCRUGGS, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212)683-6500. Chris Scruggs, the grandson of the pioneering bluegrass banjo player Earl Scruggs, returned to country by way of punk, working with Rosie Flores and with his mother, Gail Davies, and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry before joining the smart retro Nashville band BR549 as singer and guitarist in 2001. He left the group in January to resume his solo career, dipping into Western swing, rockabilly and 1960's rock. Tonight and tomorrow, three sets start at 10; admission is free.  PARELES    * SPRING BLING, Wild Palm, 1601 Bronxdale Avenue, off East Tremont, the Bronx; dancehallreggae.com. This reggae party plays features a pair of big-name DJ crews, Massive B (led by Bobby Konders and Jabba, the team behind Hot 97's long-running Sunday night reggae show) and the mighty Jamaican sound system Stone Love. Expect to hear lots of the sweet (and, for that matter, salty) neo-roots reggae records that are currently all the rage in Kingston -- in reggae, these days, everyone's feeling nostalgic. The old-school hip-hop star (and current Hot 97 radio personality) Jazzy Joyve is to serve as host. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $20.  SANNEH    THE TEMPTATIONS/THE FOUR TOPS, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)749-5838 or (212)864-0372. A double bill from the glory days of Motown. The Temptations were Motown's vehicle for both virile pleading (as in ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'') and funk-driven realism (as in ''Papa Was a Rolling Stone''). The Four Tops were a paragon of group longevity, with the same lineup from 1954 until the death of Lawrence Payton in 1997. They still have Levi Stubbs's dynamic baritone to charge through Motown classics like ''Reach Out I'll Be There'' and ''I Can't Help Myself.'' Saturday and Sunday nights at 8; tickets are $37 to $67.  PARELES    RHONDA VINCENT/JIM LAUDERDALE, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. A pair of mavericks with country roots. Rhonda Vincent sings, plays mandolin, and pushes bluegress in some modern directions without forgetting standards like ''Muleskinner Blues.'' The rangy-voiced singer Jim Lauderdale has collaborated with everyone from the bluegrass patriarch Ralph Stanley to the jam band Donna the Buffalo, and on his 2004 album ''Headed for the Hills'' (Dualtone), he wrote songs with the Grateful Dead's lyricst Robert Hunter. Tonight at 6:30 and 9; tickets are $25.  PARELES    JIMMY WEBB, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. As the writer of hits like ''Macarthur Park,'' ''By the Time I Get to Phoenix,'' ''Where's the Playground, Susie'' and ''Wichita Lineman,'' Jimmy Webb is a patriarch of lachrymose, existential pop epics with soaring tunes. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35.  PARELES    ZEN TRICKSTERS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700. The Zen Tricksters got started two decades ago playing Grateful Dead songs. While they now have their own songs to jam on, they haven't forgotten their early repertory; no less a figure than Phil Lesh of the Dead has called on their expertise. Tonight, playing two sets that start at 10:30, with CatWalkBlue opening at 8:30; tickets are $14.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BETTY BUCKLEY, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)744-1600. The unifying thought behind the singer's new show, ''Smoke,'' is the evanescence of perfect moments, often romantic ones, that we can't hold onto try as we might. The signature number in this smart, carefully balanced program that embraces jazz, country, bossa nova, pop standards, soft rock and art songs is Mary Chapin Carpenter's pop-country ''When Time Stands Still.'' Ms. Buckley's pianist, Kenny Werner, makes a formidable musical contribution. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $90; no minimum.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    * BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30 with a $10 minimum at a table.  HOLDEN    * TIERNEY SUTTON, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. Ms. Sutton is a pure jazz spirit who respects a song. Even when going out on an improvisatory limb, she never lets its essence slip away. The singer and her trio with whom she has worked for years -- Christian Jacob on piano, Kevin Axt on bass and Ray Brinker on drums -- have refined the kind of rapport that could only be achieved over time. Her deep, lingering renditions of chestnuts like ''Blue Skies'' and ''Without a Song'' are especially impressive for the sense of quiet joy she breathes into them. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30 p.m. Cover: $50, with a $20 minimum; a $50 prix fixe dinner is required at the early shows.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * PETER BERNSTEIN TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. Mr. Bernstein is fluidly improvising guitarist in the post-bop tradition, with control over harmony and a beautiful sound; he performs here with Larry Goldings on organ and Bill Stewart on drums. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 tonight and tomorrow night, $20 on Sunday.  BEN RATLIFF    * FLY, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. An excellent co-operative trio, with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard. Some of its music sounds chamberlike, some Latin, some funky; some, with breathtaking long-line improvisations and tight group communication, seems to propose a new model for saxophone trios. Tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    * HENRY GRIMES-MARSHALL ALLEN, Vision Club, Clemente Soto Velez Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side; www.visionfestival.org.A duet. The saxophonist Marshall Allen has led the Sun Ra Arkestra since Sun Ra's death, and at times he's a great player, sly and nuanced, taking in the smooth glissandos of Johnny Hodges, as well as the hard-driving, self-contained Chicago R&B style and the squeal of free jazz. Henry Grimes, the bassist, played in some of the greatest groups of the late 50's and 60's, including Sonny Rollins's and Albert Ayler's, before going below the radar for a long period in the 80's; he has recently been rebuilding a career. Tomorrow at 10 pm; admission is $10 for one set, $15 for both.  RATLIFF    * ROY HAYNES QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. An hour spent with Roy Haynes is an hour spent learning about drum sounds. Mr. Haynes was one of the first bebop drummers, having recorded with Bud Powell in 1949, and he plays bop patterns superbly when he wants, charging along with the music to support the frontline players. But more often he guts his playing of bebop clichés, changing his phrasing with every measure. He prefers startling single or double hits to rolling patterns across the drums; he often uses a very low-tuned bass tom and an even lower tympanum. In his late 70's now and still a bandleader in charge of agile young players, he is vitality itself. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover, $25, minimum, $10.  RATLIFF    JOHN HICKS TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. A presence in New York since the 1960's, Mr. Hicks is a steamroller of a mainstream-jazz pianist, loading up the music with thick chords as if he wanted to do McCoy Tyner one better. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.; cover, $25.  RATLIFF    ROSA PASSOS, Le Jazz Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455. Ms. Passos is a Brazilian singer well-versed in the subtleties of João Gilberto's art, and there's so much to admire about her: an impeccable control over a light-gauge voice, a precise sense pitch, a mastery of the complexity and freshness in bossa nova rhythm. Sets tonight and Sunday at 7:30, and tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.; $50 cover, tonight and tomorrow, $40 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    BOBBY SANABRIA AND QUARTETO ACHE, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Sanabria, the drummer and percussionist, is a great Latin-jazz practitioner and historian; he flips through Cuban and Brazilian and African rhythmic idioms and takes excellent jazz musicians along with him. Sets tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20, minimum, $10.  RATLIFF    DR. LONNIE SMITH QUARTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)258-9800. Dr. Smith -- who always appears wearing a turban, to confuse you a little -- is a master of slow, weird ideas on the Hammond organ; working in a setting of good-time, saloon-style jazz, he can turn it into a séance. His band includes the ex-James Brown band trombonist Fred Wesley, the guitarist Rodney Jones and the drummer Lennie White. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, and there is a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'CANDIDE' Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide'' opened on Broadway in 1956 at the 1,300-seat Martin Beck Theater. Watching the New York City Opera's production that opened on Tuesday night, a revival of the acclaimed 1982 staging by Harold Prince last seen at the company over 15 years ago, I only wished that this mostly delightful production of Bernstein's richest musical theater work, with a book adapted from Voltaire by Hugh Wheeler, could be played in a much smaller auditorium than the 2,700-seat New York State Theater. There is much to like about the City Opera's revival, especially the appealing cast headed by two musical theater veterans in top form: John Cullum in the double role of Voltaire and Dr. Pangloss, and Judy Kaye as the earthy Old Lady, with her vaguely Jewish-Polish accent, who is missing a buttock and full of tales about the calamities of her life. George Manahan conducted a refreshingly relaxed account of a score, giving the music room to breathe and the words space to be spoken clearly. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'ORLANDO' With the sturdy and expressive countertenor Bejun Mehta in the title role (and thus in the mad scene), chances are good that the New York City Opera will continue its run of successes in Handel operas. Chas Rader-Shieber directs, and Antony Walker conducts. The strong cast also includes Amy Burton, Jennifer Aylmer, Matthew White and David Pittsinger. Sunday at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)307-4100. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    'DER ROSENKAVALIER' Strauss's much admired opera has returned to the Met with some familiar and fresh faces in the cast. Susan Graham is in fine form for her signature role as Octavian, and the pure-voiced Laura Aikin sings Sophie. The newcomer here is the German soprano Angela Denoke, who brings an affecting sense of vulnerability to the world-weary Marschallin. Her high notes don't project as much as they waft gently into the house. In the pit, Donald Runnicles stirs up the Met Orchestra, as if to remind us that ''Rosenkavalier'' has its modern edges, too, but he is also not afraid to bask in the more nostalgic moments of this beautiful score. The Met is still getting mileage off of Nathaniel Merrill's popular production, over three decades old and counting. Tonight at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.  JEREMY EICHLER    'SAMSON ET DALILA' The portrayal of Samson by the Argentine tenor Jose Cura is the main reason to see the Metropolitan Opera's revival of its 1998 production by Elijah Moshinsky. Mr. Cura had not been back to the Met since his 1999 debut, and in the years since he has maximized his strengths and minimized his shortcomings as a singer. Though purists will still fault his vocal rawness and sometimes rough legato, he gives his all in this role, singing with passion, burnished sound, fearless attack and energy. And with his hunky physique and bold physicality, he commands the stage. Though the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves is a gorgeous and alluring Dalila, and her rich and warm voice is ideal for the role, her singing on opening nights was sometimes shaky and insecure. Bertrand de Billy was the impressive conductor. And, though the bacchanal scene may go down in Met history as a camp classic, audiences will surely enjoy ogling the scantily clad roster of muscled and sexy dancers and extras. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.  TOMMASINI    Classical Music    CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA If you missed the fine performance of Bach's ''St. John Passion'' on Tuesday at St. Thomas Church, or if you came away from it wanting more, here is the solution. Kent Tritle, who has turned the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola into a thriving center for early music, sacred music and more, leads the church forces in the ''St. John.'' James Archie Worley is the Evangelist and Matt Boehler sings Jesus in what promises to be an excellent event. Tonight at 8, Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520. Tickets: $30 and $40; $20 for students and 65+.  OESTREICH    DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY This great Russian baritone cuts an exotic figure, with his flowing silver mane, but more to the point, he brings a rich tone and a powerful expressivity to his work on both the opera and recital stage. He is at his best in Russian music, and is singing plenty of that tonight, including Mussorgsky's ''Songs and Dances of Death'' and groups of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff songs. For a change of pace, he is also singing a selection of chansons by Duparc. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $25 to $89.  ALLAN KOZINN    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT Tonight the Metropolitan Museum of Art's resident chamber ensemble comprised of excellent musicians, either young in fact or young in spirit, presents the second of three concerts this season at the Grace Rainer Rogers Auditorium, a wonderfully intimate hall for chamber music. Picking up with a series focus on recent music from Eastern Europe and Russia, the ensemble offers Avro Pärt's ''Summa'' and Giya Kancheli's ''Time and Again.'' A novelty, Rossini's String Sonata, and a rousing Romantic work, Mendelssohn's Piano Sextet, complete the program. The cellist Edward Arron is the artistic director of the series, and primarily responsible for the fresh programming. Tonight at 7, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $20; students with valid ID, $5.  TOMMASINI    METROPOLITAN OPERA NATIONAL COUNCIL GRAND FINALS CONCERT This popular yearly event presents the ten young finalists from the Metropolitan Opera's national auditions. Each will perform two arias with the Met Orchestra. Hear the stars of tomorrow today. And if this seems an exaggerating, consider that among the finalists in 1988 were four fledgling singers named Renée Fleming, Ben Heppner, Susan Graham and Heidi Grant Murphy. Ms. Graham serves as host. Guest artists include Sondra Radvanovsky, Jennifer Welch-Babidge and Garret Sorenson. The guests usually sing while the judges are picking the five ''winners,'' though everyone who makes it to this concert is a winner. Sunday at 3 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $25 to $100.  TOMMASINI    SOHEIL NASSERI A recent recital of Beethoven sonatas showed this young Californian pianist to a thoughtful, inventive interpreter and, where the music demands it, a technical powerhouse. His recital tomorrow evening includes the premiere of ''Dance Suite'' by Avner Dorman, a 25-year old Israeli composer who studied with John Corigliano at the Juilliard School, as well as Beethoven's Sonata No. 22 in F (Op. 54), Schubert's Sonata in B (D. 575) and Schumann's ''Humoreske'' (Op. 20), all works that test a player's imagination. Tomorrow at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $33 to $45, $10 for listeners under 25.  KOZINN    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The orchestra is kicking off a monthlong festival that seems on the surface something of a grab-bag but may make sense in the end. It is titled ''Visions of the Beyond,'' after Messiaen's ''Éclairs sur l'Au-Delà,'' which comes later, and includes works as diverse as Bach's ''Art of Fugue'' and Gyorgy Ligeti's ''Atmosphères.'' But it starts here with Mendelssohn's incidental music for ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' with a semistaged performance of excerpts from the play, directed by Edward Berkeley. Neville Marriner cionducts, and the cast includes Campbell Scott, Marcia Gay Harden and Hope Davis. The start of something big? Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.  OESTREICH    ORPHEUS This conductorless chamber orchestra devotes its Sunday evening concert in the Medieval Sculpture Court of the Metropolitan Museum to sacred works. The program's centerpiece is Pergolesi's Stabat Mater -- a setting that (along with Pergolesi himself for undertaking it) was disparaged by Stravinsky, but is lovely all the same. Also on the bill are some of Salamone Rossi's magnificent Psalm settings, in Hebrew. The vocal soloists are Christine Brandes, soprano, and Beth Clayton, mezzo-soprano. Sunday at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $50.  KOZINN    'SOLOMON' Handel's oratorio about the great biblical king touches on several of the principal episodes of his reign -- the visit of the Queen of Sheba, whose arrival is accompanied by some of this score's most famous music, for example, and the incident in which two women claim a single baby as their own. Johannes Somary and his Amor Artis Chamber Choir are known for their fine performances of the Handel oratorios, and tonight they offer ''Solomon'' with the support of a period instrument orchestra. The soloists include Terrence Barber as Solomon; Michael Steinberger as Zadok the Priest, Julianne Baird as the Queen of Sheba, and Cynthia Richards Wallace as Solomon's Queen -- or one of them; Handel didn't take into account that he had roughly 1,000 of them. Ms. Baird and Ms. Wallace also portray the baby-disputing harlots. Tonight at 8, Church of the Blessed Sacrament, 152 West 71st Street, (212)874-4513. Tickets: $20, $15 for students and 62+.  KOZINN    TRIGON STRING TRIO Miller Theater and the Trigon String Trio are attempting to pick up where Mozart left off. The composer took portions of Bach's trio sonatas (written for organ) and arranged them for violin, viola and cello. In three concerts over the course of this season, this ensemble will offer all six trio sonatas as string trios. Tonight's concert, the second in the series, will also feature a Mozart Divertimento (K. 563). Tonight at 8, Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $25.  EICHLER    ZEHETMAIR TRIO This ensemble is usually a fine string quartet led by the resourceful Austrian violinist Thomas Zehetmair, but the group has been traveling as a trio since Matthias Metzger, the second violinist, withdrew from its current tour due to illness. The reconfigured program includes Schubert's great B-flat Major String Trio as well as works by Mozart and Gideon Klein. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $42.

BAX 2005 WOMEN'S PERFORMANCE FESTIVAL This celebration of performing-arts work by women features dance by Jen Abrams and theater by Amy Jo Goddard (tonight and tomorrow) and Marlies Yearby and her Movin' Spirits Dance Theater (Sunday). Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Brooklyn Arts Exchange (BAX), 421 Fifth Avenue at Eighth Street, Park Slope, (718)832-0018 or www.bax.org Tickets: $8 to $15.  JENNIFER DUNNING    ALEXANDRA BELLER AND ALETHEA ADSITT Ms. Beller has moved on from danced Chekhov to Sartre and his ''No Exit,'' set to a soundscore by Robert Poss with a set filled with green balloons. Her characters are a frustrated Broadway diva in a scuba suit, a murderous debutante, a murdered pacifist and a tap-dancing lesbian. Ms. Adsitt has settled for exploring how humans absorb and navigate a hyper-urban environment, in her new ''Blink: The Indelible Blue Wall Coda.'' Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)253-8899. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    * PETER BOAL & COMPANY Mr. Boal, who will take over the directorship of the Pacific Northwest Ballet in the fall, is going out with a bang in this final New York City program by his own small company. To start, the dancers include him, the exquisite Wendy Whelan and the young City Ballet up-and-comers Andrew Veyette and Sean Suozzi. The repertory includes world premieres by Edwaard Liang, Victor Quijada and Shen Wei, Daniel Nagrin's classic ''Strange Hero'' and a dance by Wendy Perron. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or www.joyce.org. Tickets: $42.  DUNNING    CLARE BYRNE AND AMY LARIMER We're shy about telling you the title, which could be misinterpreted, for this raunchy-sounding piece about ''dance-world jaded lizards.'' The part-dance, part situation-comedy work will be presented on a program shared with the performance-artist Sara Juli. Tonight at 8., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212)219-0736. Tickets: $12; $10, students at 65+  DUNNING    ERICA ESSNER PERFORMANCE CO-OP Ms. Essner has been praised for her fine-scaled expressionism. Her subjects here include men dancing in America, meditation and chaos, isolation in a crowd and contorted shapes (in a dance set to tango music). Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    FRIDAYS AT NOON This informal free talk-and-dance series will focus this weekend on new dances by Jordan Fuchs, Leah Kreutzer and Eryc Taylor. Today at noon, 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, Lexington Avenue at 92nd Street, Manhattan, (212)415-5500.  DUNNING    KATE GYLLENHAAL/MO CO Thoughts of home have influenced the dances on this program, all choreographed by Ms. Gyllenhaal. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, (212)220-1460. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    'I LOVE TANGO' This ''tango musical'' boasts four dancers and live string, bandoneon, piano and vocal music. Through March 27. Tonight and tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+ ; $25 (Thursdays).  DUNNING    MOB PRODUCTIONS AND ROBBINSCHILDS Two groups offer a double feature of premieres. Mollie O'Brien's ''This Is What I Would Have Felt,'' for her company, MOB Productions, uses the body to express sensations of illness that may be verbally indescribable. ''Half Space,'' by Sonya Robbins and Layla Childs depicts empty places, public spaces and imagined time travel with the aid of carpet runners, piles of chairs and a big chandelier. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $20. (Related review, Page Page 3.)  JACK ANDERSON    NAYIKAS DANCE THEATER Billing itself as New York's first resident dance theater company specializing in the Indian classical Odissi form, the troupe will perform the director Myna Mukherjee's ''Glow,'' a new multimedia dance and theater piece that draws on the glowing sensuality of women. Tonight at 7 p.m. and tomorrow at 3 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344. Tickets: $25; $18 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    PEARSONWIDRIG DANCE THEATER Sara Pearson and Patrik Widrig, who have been dancing and creating choreographic journeys together for more than 20 years, offer the world premiere of ''Thaw,'' an evocation of the ill-fated 1914 Antarctic expedition of the explorer Ernest Shackleton. They venture to the South Pole with the aid of recorded bird calls, documentary film footage and actual pieces of ice. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $20. (Related review, Page 4.)  ANDERSON    SOWETO STREET BEAT This all-male troupe of dancers, singers and musicians came originally from the streets of Johannesburg. They've kept the spirit alive in ''Zulu Kingdom,'' complete with a traditional gumboot dance. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Brooklyn Center at Brooklyn College, one block from the junction of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, (718)951-4600. Tickets: $30.  DUNNING    * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY In its closing weekend, the company is presenting one of its best programs tonight, when Mr. Taylor's wonderfully humane, closet-pyrotechnians will dance his powerful and haunting ''Last Look,'' his sly ''Cloven Kingdom'' and his delectably goofy ''Offenbach Overtures.'' Two Taylor classics (''Aureole'' and ''3 Epitaphs'') will be performed tomorrow night on a program that also includes a season premiere (''Dante Variations). The other premiere will be performed on Sunday on a program that ends with another Taylor classic, ''Esplanade.'' Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-1212. Tickets: $15 to $75.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression, the emotions that reveal themselves after her best pictures leave their first impression, which is often alarm. She captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and -- this probably applies as much to Arbus as to any other photographer of the second half of the last century -- she captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some maddeningly dark, dense and absurdly theatrical galleries, like chapels, of memorabilia. That said, touches her favorite subjects with grace. Even the shocking photographs of retarded women are sympathetic, implying that the world is full of wondrous things, if our eyes are open enough to recognize them, and that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $7 and 65+, $10.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    'BASQUIAT,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)683-5000, through June 5. In the 1980's, the hyper-talented Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame, usually on the same surface. His loquacious, ugly-elegant ''letters to the world'' (Emily Dickinson's phrase), were in step with the 80's interest in collage and in redirecting the avant-garde strategies of Post-Minimalism into painting. But Basquiat also had an urgent subject: blackness, whose glories, histories and pain his art elucidates with extraordinary complexity, in volatile mixtures of ideas, emotions, colors and images that expand the viewer's experience of time and space. This generous retrospective has a few glitches -- too many works borrowed from too few collections and a slightly too empty look in some galleries -- but nothing really detracts from its power. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  ROBERTA SMITH    * THOMAS DEMAND, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400, through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, so as to take his own cinematic photographs. He is really a sculptor, making models of places, to produce pictures that have the presence of paintings. His subject is more than just photography's inherent unreliability, its slipperiness as truth. It also entails memory. He has reconstructed, from photographs, the blown-up room where plotters failed to kill Hitler, and the studio of an artist whom Baader-Meinhof terrorists assaulted during the 1970's in order to blow up the house of a prosecutor who lived next door. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students; children 16 and under and accompanied by an adult, free. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. Hours and admission: see above.  KIMMELMAN    * TIM HAWKINSON, Whitney Museum of American Art, Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212)570-3676, through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Tim Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, sprawling in no obvious order across the museum's fourth floor, hopscotches from one dexterous tour-de-force to the next. Each requires some head-scratching decipherment, inviting admiration for its doggedness, while not straining too hard to earn a viewer's love. Feats of physical fancy, when so dizzily executed, can be their own justification. Mr. Hawkinson's larger purpose, you might say, is simply wonderment. At the same time the art borrows a healthy strain of ludicrous wit from Samuel Beckett, who knew a thing or two about how to clown around smartly. Hours: Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Friday 1 to 9 p.m.; closed Monday and Tuesday. Admission: $12; 62+, $9.50; New York City students with valid ID and children 11 and under, free.  KIMMELMAN    * 'PETER PAUL RUBENS (1577-1640): THE DRAWINGS,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through April 3. The show is sublime. It makes not the slightest difference that it has no grand thesis, provides no narrative arc, offers up a few newly discovered drawings and fresh, solid scholarship but no radical twist on the artist. If there is any artistic justice, the exhibition ought to inspire the sort of mobbish devotion that the Met show of Leonardo's drawings did two years ago. Reviewing the work seems a bit silly. What is there to say, except that the drawings illustrate the limits of what is humanly possible with a piece of chalk and a pen and paper? It is profoundly heartening. Rubens loved to draw and loved that he could draw like a god, and his joy is ours, in looking at what he drew. This includes a few drawings by other artists with which Rubens fussed, sticking in angels here, touching up a beard there. Rubens regarded drawings, other people's and his own, as organic, to be learned from and endlessly improved upon, like life. Hours and admission: See above.  KIMMELMAN    Galleries: Uptown    NINA MUSHINSKY, Janos Gat, 1100 Madison Avenue, between 82nd and 83rd Streets, (212)327-0441, through April 2. Ms. Mushinsky is a New York-based painter who makes labor intensive, all black and white pictures based on photographs she has taken in Central Europe. Her paintings of subjects like an antique dress in a history museum, a bleak highway ramp or blurry laughing people in a leafy backyard can take as long as two years to complete. They have a smudgy, dreamlike hyperreality.  KEN JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    SIDNEY GEIST: 'PHASES OF SCULPTURE,' Jason McCoy, Inc., 41 East 57th Street, (212)319-1996, through April 1. In work that goes back to the 1930's, Mr. Geist -- a sculptor as well as a teacher and writer noted for his studies of Brancusi -- has reached out to many different cultures and individuals for inspiration, from tribal art to Picasso and David Smith. The show is populated by tall, totemic structures of carved and painted wood, including a bosomy bright red ''Goddess,'' 8 1/2 feet high, but there are many smaller works like ''Rise,'' a biomorphic, Arp-esque piece of two sensuous curves, one smaller than the other, joined by a narrow isthmus. Brancusi is most significantly saluted in ''Homage Without End,'' a tall, skinny piece in raw wood whose title and structure of repetitive modules derive from the sculptor's series of ''Endless Columns.'' Mr. Geist has tried his hand at a forest of styles without ever arriving at a distinctive ''signature'' mode. Is that bad? No. Credit him with the fervor of an explorer.  GRACE GLUECK    NANCY GRAVES: 'A RETROSPECTIVE,' Ameringer & Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through April 2. Graves, who died of cancer 10 years ago, first drew attention in the late 60's for her life-size, hyper-realistic camels. This retrospective includes a prehistoric camel skull and spine from the period that was later cast in bronze. The most convincing work remains the airy, playfully disjunctive and colorfully and loosely painted assemblages of the 80's made of found objects cast in bronze, including parts of plants, mechanical fragments, tools and food products.  JOHNSON    R. B. KITAJ: 'HOW TO REACH 72 IN A JEWISH ART,' Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900, through April 2. Mr. Kitaj's overpopulated mess of an exhibition is as interesting as it is exasperating. His ongoing visual autobiography tracks his life as a Jewish intellectual, eccentric Modernist and wild old man with Biblical white hair and beard in erotic encounters with pretty young women. The subject matter is intriguing but it is realized in drawings and paintings with such sketchy impatience you wish he'd just slow down and paint nothing but still-lifes for a while.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    'BODY PROXY: AN EXHIBITION BY NORMA JEANE,' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through March 26. Norma Jeane is the fictive persona in whose name a group of anonymous people produce works of conceptual art. This show includes a motorcycle that starts up and roars increasingly loudly as you approach; a 100 kilometer long strand of hair on a spool made by knotting together hairs from one person's head; and a round, flesh-colored sofa said to be saturated with sexually provocative pheromones that will get into your clothes if you sit on it.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    'JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT: IN WORDS ONLY,' Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through March 26. This excellent show concentrates on the cornerstones of Basquiat's art: language and a blocky, concise handwriting that amounts to a personal, almost digital typeface. The only images here are words, names, lists and phrases, often appropriated from odd places, like the index of a book on jazz or the title of a painting by Ter Borch. One nine-sheet work is simply a rewriting of the prolonged table of contents of ''Moby-Dick,'' suggesting a kind of poem.  SMITH    CHRISTIAN MOELLER: 'HEAVEN,' Frederieke Taylor, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-0992, through March 12. A professor of design/media arts at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Moeller is known internationally for interactive sound, light and architectural installations. Here he presents a comparatively simple installation of fluorescent light works in which shadowy words like heaven, goat, lick, tryst and vodka emerge mysteriously from banks of thin, white parallel tubes. It is literally the brightest show in town.  JOHNSON    'KA/VH:RA/AG,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through March 26. It's always good news when artists like work that doesn't resemble theirs. Thus, the motley appearance of this four-person exhibition, which resulted when two 5BE artists -- Richard Aldrich and Kamrooz Aram -- each invited another artist to show with them. But Mr. Aram's sly, lush recyclings of decorative and religious Persian, Chinese and Christian motifs share with Van Hanos's relatively Gothic vision an interest in mystical power and paint's physicality. And Mr. Aldrich's fragmentary abstract drawings share a studied, 1970s-based nonchalance (and, here, a darkened space) with the Amy Granat's film installation, which uses scratched film and scratchier sound to reshape space, and is the show's standout.  SMITH    IMRE KINSZKI, Klotz/Sirmon, 511 West 25th Street, (212)741-4764, through March 26. Born in Budapest in 1901, Kinszki was a well-connected Modernist photographer whose works could stand up with pictures by more famous Hungarian peers like Andre Kertesz, Brassai and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. The tiny, velvety contact prints from the 20's and 30's in this show are formally exquisite and often emotionally poignant. They include a monumental close-up of chess pieces; studies of buildings and shadows; and a heartbreakingly lovely picture of a sleeping baby. Kinszki never left Hungary, and he died in a concentration camp in 1945.  JOHNSON    CHERYL LAEMMLE, R. Duane Reed, 529 West 20th Street, (212)462-2600, through April 2. People who were around in the 80's may remember Ms. Laemmle's zany paintings of humanoid figures made of white birch logs. This exciting comeback show, the artist's first in New York since 1994, presents weirdly elegant paintings of strangely distorted cartoon birds, predatory cats and children perched on tree branches. The imagery looks like it was lifted from an antique children's book, and it is painted with an economical yet sensuous touch on unprimed linen.  JOHNSON    CORNELIA RENZ, Goff + Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212)675-0461, through April 16. This Berlin-based artist draws large, provocative cartoon images of chubby, exotically costumed young girls with adult characteristics of sexuality and aggression. Ms. Renz draws with felt-tip markers on both sides of big sheets of acrylic glass as well as on underlying white panels, creating much linear complexity. And she encloses her pictures appropriately in clinical white plastic frames of her own devising.  JOHNSON    LARRY ZOX: 'FIVE DECADES,' Stephen Haller Gallery, 542 West 26th Street, (212)741-7777, through April 5. Larry Zox's distinctive, color-drenched hard-edge canvases that made a splash in the Color Field movement of the 1960's form the bulk of this mini-retrospective, which covers his work from the late 50's to now. The signature 60's work, revealing his association with the group that included Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland, was based on a tricky geometrical scheme involving the interplay of diamonds and diagonals, which he worked with many variations and impressive results. His technique has since become much freer, and in his most recent, more emotive work color seems more important than structure.  GLUECK    Other Galleries    PETER CAINE: 'DOMO ARIGATO, MR. ROBOTO,' Jack the Pelican, 487 Driggs Avenue, Brooklyn, (718)782-0183, through March 27. There is something to offend if not necessarily amuse everyone in Mr. Caine's hyperkinetic exhibition of electronically animated mannequins and crude handmade effigies. His obscenely activated and often talking representations include a warty, porcine policeman; President Bush and a monstrous green extraterrestrial; a picnic of Nazi schoolgirls; a scatological Sister Wendy and lots more.  JOHNSON    'ANDY MESSERSCHMIDT: HOODWINKERS, FAUXS, IMPOSTORS AND SNAKEOILERS,' Plane Space, 102 Charles Street, West Village, (917)606-1268, through March 27. The deception alluded to in this exhibition's title may reflect that the bright, patterned paintings turn out to be elaborate combinations of doilies, lace, fabric, plus well-placed paint. Their intensely decorative, symmetrical intricacies and occasional excursions into delicate drawing are all a little too current. But 45 watercolor collages, each 10 inches square, while more conservative, suggest that the artist, a 2002 M.F.A. from the University of Minnesota, has other options.  SMITH    Last Chance    CHINATSU BAN, Marianne Boesky Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)680-9889, closing tomorrow. Brightly colored underpants drift through the air, are worn by little girls and their boxy guardian elephants in the slightly-too-sweet paintings and sculpture with which this talented young Japanese artist is making her New York debut. Possibly demonic apple halves occasionally threaten, and the total effect is of a freshened up mythology. All is enhanced by the artist's delicate but assured painting skills, which suggest an uncanny, intuitive fusion of Color Field painting, Japanese screens, Paul Klee and Indian miniatures.  SMITH    ALISON FOX, ATM Gallery, 170 Avenue B near 10th Street, East Village, (212)375-0349, closing on Sunday. The clunky abstracted still lifes, pervaded by an interest in the textile arts, that fill this young New York artist's first solo make capable although hardly groundbreaking use of familiar quantities, operating in terrain bordered by Dana Schutz, Jessica Stockholder and the British painter Howard Hodgkin. She is at her best in ham-handed Cubistic works like ''Voodoo Lady'' and ''Johanna's Party'' whose crowded colors, impastos, wet-on-wet flourishes and overlapping forms seem to cry out for a larger surface. Luckily they seldom get it.  SMITH    ROBERT MORRIS: 'SMALL FIRES AND MNEMONIC NIGHTS,' Leo Castelli, 18 East 77th Street, (212)249-4470, closing tomorrow. The co-founder of Minimalism's surprising new, easel-size encaustic paintings look like they were made by Edward Hopper under the influence of Magritte and de Chirico. Images of nocturnal, moonlit rooms with fires and explosions in the distance convey feelings of loneliness and grief; and images of public sites like ""Boys Room"" or ""Union Station"" are like places from the artist's own past revisited in dreams.  JOHNSON    LANE TWITCHELL: 'HERE & THERE,' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, closing tomorrow. Mr. Twitchell continues to produce astoundingly intricate patterns by folding and cutting into sheets of paper as large as six feet square. Close examination discovers all kinds of cultural signifiers and underpainting and overpainting enhance the complication. The only problem is the greasy-looking resin in which the cut-outs are submerged; there must be a better way to preserve and protect Mr. Twitchell's wonderfully delicate and expansive filigree.  JOHNSON    JOHN WALKER: 'COLLAGE,' Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550, closing tomorrow. This English artist who now lives in Maine produced the six powerfully imposing Cubist collages featured here while living and teaching in New York in the mid-70's. Each measures 10 by 8 feet and has leathery surfaces of painted, irregularly cut-up pieces of canvas. Today they seem old fashioned, even a little academic. Still, the rumbling, viscerally physical energy they exude remains exciting.

6," Sunday 3|6    COMEDY WITH BAGELS  The literary critic James Wood appears in the relatively intimate space of the 92nd Street Y's art gallery for a morning of whitefish, lox and Salman Rushdie. Mr. Wood's latest book, ''The Irresponsible Self: On Laughter and the Novel,'' addresses comedy in fiction, and while you nosh he'll be talking about humor in the work of Saul Bellow, Jonathan Franzen and the like.  1395 Lexington Avenue, at 92nd Street; 11 a.m.; $35, including a kosher brunch.    THREE OPERAS  Three new American operas, still works in progress, are sung by musicians from American Opera Projects, Encompass New Opera Theater and the Manhattan School of Music. The raciest of the three, ''Dream President,'' by Jennifer Griffith, draws on her own erotic reveries about a real-life American leader.  Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street; 2:30 p.m.; $20.    ROCKY BALLET  It's the Colorado Ballet's third trip to the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, and the company is bringing a big program: ''Rachmaninoff Second'' is choreographed by the former Bolshoi dancer Konstantin Uralsky, and ''Dracula'' has the count slinking and skulking. The evening ends on a rowdy note with ''Vital Sensations,'' set to music by Tito Puente, the drum-and-bass producer Roni Size/Reprazent and others.  Whitman Hall, Brooklyn College, Flatbush; 2 p.m.; $35.    IRANIAN CONFAB  Once every year or so, a self-described supergroup of four Iranian musicians swings through New York. While the group's moniker, Masters of Persian Music, may be immodest, they prove their chops on the plucked lute and the spike fiddle on their new CD, ''Faryad'' (World Village/Harmonia Mundi USA).  Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street; 7 p.m.; $30 to $50. (Also next Sunday.)    Monday 3|7    THE RETURN OF DISCO  The New York-based band Ambulance Ltd. has a moody, almost ethereal guitar-pop sound, but its members enjoy messing with standard pop song formulas. Tonight they open for the Louisville, Ky.-based guys of VHS or Beta. As they showed on the 2004 album ''Night on Fire,'' they prefer their songs classically constructed: they explore the most structured pop, drawing from early new wave and its kissing cousin, straight-up disco.  Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $16. (VHS or Beta also plays on Tuesday.)    POLI-SCI DANCE  ''Dancing on the Battlements,'' a panel discussion led by the Brooklyn Academy of Music's executive producer, Joseph V. Melillo, brings together choreographers like Ibrahim Quraishi from Pakistan and Patricia Hoffbauer from Brazil for a conversation about the impact of the Patriot Act on those who work in a global discipline.  New School for Social Research, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village; 6:30 p.m.; $8.    NEW ON DVD: HEROES AND THE MOLE  ''Unlikely Heroes'' (Koch Vision, $24.98), narrated by Ben Kingsley, tells the stories of seven people from seven countries who, working alone, fought Nazism. ''The Mole: The Complete First Season'' (Red Distribution, $19.98) mixes paranoia with reality-show challenges, and puts the show's host (and current CNN anchor) Anderson Cooper in his most non-newsworthy role to date.    Tuesday 3|8    LUNCH ACCOMPANIMENT  Once a month, Midtown Manhattan gets a lunchtime concert on the Central Synagogue's incredible 4,345-pipe organ. Today's repertory: John Scott, the organist and choirmaster of St. Thomas Church, plays works by Bach, Franck and Liszt.  652 Lexington Avenue, at 55th Street; 12:30 p.m.; free    THE IDES OF MARCH ARE COME  With the disastrous ''Dracula'' a distant memory, the Belasco Theater begins again with a clean slate. Tonight, previews begin for Broadway's ''Julius Caesar,'' starring Denzel Washington as Brutus.  111 West 44th Street; 8 p.m.; $51.25 to $101.25.    JAZZ FOR READING  The Lady Liberty Jazz All-Stars aren't a groovy group of femmes; they are a group of well-known musicians, directed by the saxophonist Vincent Herring, that takes its name from the Lady Liberty Educational Alliance, which provides free reading tutors for students struggling with literacy. At tonight's benefit, the big band, stocked with vibraphone and horn, backs the singer Pamela Luss.  Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall; 8 p.m.; $45.    MAKING SENSE  Bach, Julius Caesar and jazz not enough? If you're still looking for something to do today, check out Nonsense NYC, a weekly e-mail events list run by the Brooklyn resident Jeff Stark. More of an enthusiast than a publicist, he skews toward independent, strange and inexpensive productions. Soon the weekly e-mail service will add a text-messaging based system for delivery via phone.  Sign up at: www.nonsensenyc.com.    Wednesday 3|9    FUNNY PAGES  The Cupcake series of readings by women tonight features two graphic novelists, whose work will be projected while being read. Megan Kelso's mid-90's comic book ''Girlhero'' was a sassy feminist treatise; for the last few years, she's been serializing a long work called ''Artichoke Tales.'' Ariel Bordeaux has a similar story; she now delivers irregular installments of ''Raisin Pie.''  Lolita, 266 Broome Street, Lower East Side; 7:30 p.m.; free.    MORE DOUBT  Tonight's the first preview of ''Doubt,'' the Catholic-school drama that had a limited Off Broadway run and was snapped up for a transfer to Broadway. The highly praised cast of four, including Cherry Jones, has come along to the new address.  Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; 8 p.m.; $26.25 to $90.25.    CRAFTING TO THE DEATH  Going up against tonight's South Park season premiere; a new show, ''Craft Corner Deathmatch.'' In a chain-link cage reminiscent of Comedy Central's ''Battlebots,'' tonight's first challenge pits two craft enthusiasts in a competition to create brooches out of candy. A panel of three judges reviews the on-the-spot creations as the audience screams.  Style Network; 10 p.m.    MOOD MUSIC  This lineup of bands could serve as an introduction to emo music -- it will cheer you up if you're feeling down, although the opposite may be equally true. Rainer Maria's strength has always been its beautiful vocal harmonies; Autodrone sounds like New Order without the techno fascination but with a great singer; Parts & Labor brings a bit of aggressive noise to the scene.  Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side; 7 p.m.; $12.    Thursday 3|10    VINCENT'S EVIL  At random locations around the city, you might catch one of those ubiquitous fire-code-mandated ''Exit'' signs that's been altered so it spells out ''Evil'' instead. If so, you're looking at an older project by Vincent Mazeau (he makes them but does not install them), whose new exhibition of everyday items like picnic tables ''frozen'' under fake icicles and snow has just opened. And his ''Castle'' is a looming 12-foot tower of 25 icy shipping pallets.  Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; free. (Through April 9.)    SOUTHERN VÉRITÉ  ''Sheriff'' is a new full-length documentary by Daniel Kraus, the director of ''Jefftowne,'' a 1997 portrait of a hard-drinking shoplifting enthusiast with Down's syndrome -- not exactly the ideal spokesman for people with disabilities. ''Sheriff'' follows Ronald E. Hewett, chief lawman of the very rural Brunswick County, N.C., over four years, as he investigates the murder of an elderly lawyer and other crimes, in an area where he's related to perhaps a full third of the population.  Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; 9 p.m.; $9. (Through March 15.)    NEW ON CD: SARAH LEE GUTHRIE  John Digweed's ''Fabric 20'' (Fabric, $17.98) is a pared-down D.J. set by a number of emerging nightclub artists, including D.J. Rasoul and Angel Alanis. Sarah Lee Guthrie (daughter of Arlo) has a new folk-rock collaboration with Johnny Irion called ''Exploration'' (New West, $17.98) -- sort of like Gillian Welch after therapy. The Kills' highly anticipated new album, ''No Wow'' (Rough Trade/RCA, $13.98), lends itself to lots of anti-hype jokes, but its music is all murky, sexy rock.    Friday 3|11    THREE PIECES  Relache, an eight-member Philadelphia-based new music group, will be performing, for the first time in New York, three commissioned works, including Amy Denio's ''Three Pieces,'' which takes a lighthearted approach to noise, atonality and Indian raga. The other works are by Leslie Burrs and Shafer Mahoney.  The Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street; 8:30 p.m.; $21, $18 for students and 65+.    NEW FILMS: LESS PASSION  The comedy ''Mail Order Wife'' pits a documentary filmmaker against a mail-order bride shopper over the issue of the young woman's future (Dada, at the Angelika). Danny Boyle's ''Millions'' puts a ton of cash in the hands of little Liverpudlians -- and a lot of production budget into special effects(Fox Searchlight, limited). And, just in time for Easter, Mel Gibson has a new version of ''The Passion of the Christ,'' called, in best D.J. style, ''The Passion Recut.'' The cutting, paradoxically, results in less onscreen blood and guts. (Newmarket, national).    MIAMI COLLAGE  Saturday is the last day of an exhibition by Gean Moreno, a Miami painter and collagist having his first solo showing in New York. His work looks like simple (if overwhelming) psychedelia at first, but on closer examination little details make themselves known: a fabric pattern, a bit of an advertisement, a 70's-style iconic product silhouette.  Derek Eller Gallery, 526 West 25th Street, Chelsea; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; free.    Saturday 3|12    FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT  The New York Underground Film Festival began on Wednesday with the premiere of ''The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things,'' Asia Argento's adaptation of the JT LeRoy book; on Sunday, it'll show the actor Crispin Hellion Glover's incredibly disturbing exploration of race, called ''What Is It?'' But tonight at 10:30 is the world premiere of the New Orleans-based director Ryan Trecartin's ''A Family Finds Entertainment,'' a video which is interrupted by live performers in the audience; it's about friends rescuing a boy from death.  Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, East Village; for a full schedule, www.nyuff.com. (Through March 15.)    JAM QUARTET  Still only in his mid-20's, the saxophonist Marcus Strickland has carved out a reputation for playing tight, gleeful jazz with his quartet. They play two sets tonight, with Mr. Strickland switching between soprano and tenor at will.  Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village; 9 and 10:30 p.m.; $15.    GOOPY WALL ART  Francine Spiegel's assemblages are gruesome and funny; in ''Dark Side of the Wall,'' deflated Mylar balloons are used as a canvas for messy paint and inkjet photos -- of naked women, covered in mud, and wrestling or rocking out. Her specialty is controlled sloppiness, and she stops just short of icky.  Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, off Rivington Street, Lower East Side; noon to 6 p.m.; free.

Broadway    +'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Even those who believe that everything in this planet has a purpose may at first have trouble justifying the existence of ''Good Vibrations,'' the singing headache that manages to purge all catchiness from the surpassingly catchy hits of the Beach Boys. But audience members strong enough to sit through this rickety jukebox of a show will discover that the production, directed and choreographed by John Carrafa, does have a reason to be. ''Good Vibrations'' sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good. As the show's washboard-stomached performers smile, wriggle and squeak with the desperation of wet young things hung out to dry, you feel their pain. It is unlikely, however, to be more acute than yours (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $76 to $101; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets are available at the box office on the day of the show.  BENB RANTLEY    +'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'') shows a gift for fresh, comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    'AFTER ASHLEY' If the last two hours of Gina Gionfriddo's play were as fine as the first 15 minutes, we'd have something to cheer. But the spark of interest ignited by the fresh first scene, a disarming and funny heart-to-heart between a confused mother and her teenage son, is all but extinguished by the time this finger-wagging satire has concluded. Ms. Gionfriddo has set out to diagnose social ills, and nuanced characters are not required. Her target is America's taste for blood, and its tabloid-tinged, sex-crime-addicted popular media. Despite some fine work from Anna Paquin and particularly Kieran Culkin, the director Terry Kinney's production is sabotaged by the conflicting impulses in the writing (2:15). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'THE CONTROVERSY OF VALLADOLID' The historical drama makes an unexpected return with this academic exercise in forensics. Written by Jean-Claude Carrière, the play, in an English version by Richard Nelson and directed by David Jones, is a fictionalized re-creation of an actual debate that took place in a monastery in 16th-century Spain. The topic: whether the Indians under Spanish rule in the New World were to be classified as human beings, with full rights as Christians, or a lesser species entitled to a more limited benefits package. The play has clearly been mounted for reasons of current resonance, touching as it does on the morality of dominant world powers imposing their ideologies on other cultures, and the destructive effects thereof. But its rigid dynamics are ponderous (1:45). Public Theater/Newman Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50.  ISHERWOOD    'COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW' Entertainment in abundance radiates from the Peccadillo Theater Company's new production of this old Elmer Rice drama. Starring the Tony Award-winning John Rubinstein, ''Counsellor-at-Law'' is a drama that throbs with New York life and brims with touchstones of another time, like ''George White's Scandals'' and the Court of General Sessions. But it also retains relevance to ambition and success in the 21st century. It has a hero worth rooting for, a healthy dose of sacred and profane love, some sharp jabs at class difference, villains who merit a hearty hiss and plenty of New York attitude and humor (2:45). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $55; $20 student rush tickets available at the box office 15 minutes before the show.  LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    'ENDGAME' Tony Roberts, the actor often used by Woody Allen to epitomize suave charm in contrast to his own hapless shlubbery, moves into new territory as Hamm in this middling revival of Samuel Beckett's caustic comedy about man's fumbling reckoning with extinction. Mr. Roberts's urbanity is naturally translated into Hamm's imperiousness, and his polished tones lend richly funny colorations to Hamm's more high-minded monologues. But this production is sharper at etching the play's mordant humor than outlining the heaving shoals of dread on which it should rest. Nevertheless, it's also notable for the performance of Alvin Epstein, a superlative Beckett interpreter, as Nagg (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212)727-2737. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $50.  ISHERWOOD    'THE LAST DAYS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT' This latest work from the author of ""Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train"" brings to mind an unusually lively senior class project. Thank heaven -- a subject much discussed in this debate of a drama about the Bible's most famous betrayal -- that at least the person in charge is the class cutup. And that he is popular enough to recruit some really cool friends (including Eric Bogosian, Sam Rockwell and the show's director, Philip Seymour Hoffman). Still, the colorful vernacular speech and flashy performances can't disguise the impression that the play is a heavily footnoted position paper on a big, big subject (2:40) . Public Theater/Martinson Hall, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    + 'ON THE MOUNTAIN' Christopher Shinn, an up-and-coming playwright of exceptional talent, trains his focus squarely on the unexceptional in this gentle wisp of a play. Inspired by Henry James's ''Aspern Papers,'' the play tells a similar story of a determined collector on the trail of the jealously guarded secret work of a celebrated artist, now dead. The dialogue is impeccably true to the jagged rhythms and syntactical aberrations of real speech. But Mr. Shinn seems so enamored of how his people talk that he forgets to notice what it is they're actually saying. In ''On the Mountain,'' nobody says anything of much interest, and it's possible to admire Mr. Shinn's sharp ear while still being bored (1:15). Playwrights Horizons, Mainstage Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55, with a limited number of $15 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the curtain.  ISHERWOOD    'ROMANCE' Listen up, you mugs. Nobody makes fun of David Mamet, see, because David Mamet can take care of that all by hisself. In the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, Mr. Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either. Neil Pepe directs an irreproachable but ineffective cast that includes Larry Bryggman and Bob Balaban (1:35). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55. BRANTLEY    + * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories from the mid-19th century, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest. Directed by Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott, and featuring bizarrely beautiful songs by Martyn Jacques, ''Shockheaded Peter'' manages to wallow in and tear apart our enduring appetite for scaring ourselves. Though styled as a Victorian peep show, this British import makes contemporary self-spoofing horror exercises (like Wes Craven's ''Scream'' movies) look like, well, child's play (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Thursdays at 10 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $21.25 to $66.24.  BRANTLEY    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.  PHOEBE HOBAN    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45.  ISHERWOOD    +'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in the case of ''The Musical of Musicals!'' Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. The best parodists don't sneer, they tease, and share the form's joie de vivre. Aficionados will get every joke and neophytes will laugh, too. ''The Musical of Musicals!'' creates its own lightly absurd world (90 minutes). Dodger Stages, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $59.50.  MARGO JEFFERSON    Off Off Broadway    'HIDING BEHIND COMETS' The dynamics of the guy-walks-into-a-bar play are tricky. Inject a set of twins into the mix, as Brian Dykstra does in his play, and you've pretty much doomed the venture. In fiction they too often seem like a cheap gimmick. The twins here are a male-female pair, 20-somethings named Troy (Robert Mollohan) and Honey (Moira MacDonald). They mind their father's dingy bar. The stranger who intrudes is Cole (Dan Moran), an elliptical older fellow with a temper. After much verbal sparring, the point emerges: Cole was supposedly at Jonestown during the mass suicide there in 1978, and he has dropped by the bar to force Honey and Troy to rethink their parentage. Mr. Dykstra's script sounds as if it's banking on the shock value of Jonestown, hoping that the audience, like the idiot twins on the stage, will not have heard of it. Way too early for that (1:45). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, (212)868-4444. Thursdays through Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $19.  NEIL GENZLINGER    Last Chance    'SHAKIN' THE MESS OUTTA MISERY' These days the stories that most shape young minds often come from a television set. Too bad, because, as ''Shakin''' reminds us, a parent with a knack for storytelling can pass on more valuable truths and history than any sitcom can. The young black woman at the center of this compact play by Shay Youngblood is fortunate in that she has a half-dozen parents to fill the storytelling role, all women. Her real mother, though, is not among them; she disappeared when the girl -- known only as Daughter -- was young. Daughter has been raised by a boisterous collection of women in her Southern community, and each has a story to impart. Men receive a one-sided treatment: those who turn up in the women's tales are racists, rapists and philanderers. The play also often seems disjointed; it's rarely clear when the various tales are taking place. But the cast is nicely in sync, and Ms. Youngblood conceals her platitudes well (1:30). Vital Theater Company, at the McGinn/Cazale Theater, above the Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, fourth floor, at 76th Street, (212)352-3101. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; Sunday at 7. Tickets $15, $10 for students.  GENZLINGER    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. (It won five Oscars, including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett.) Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 1920's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BEAUTIFUL BOXER' Starring Asanee Suwan. Directed by Ekachai Uekrongtham. (No rating, 118 minutes; in Thai and English, with English subtitles). ''Beautiful Boxer'' tells the true story of Parinya Charoenphol, nicknamed Nong Toom (played by Mr. Suwan), a cross-dressing kickboxer from a poor family who saved his championship winnings to undergo a sex-change operation at the age of 19. The teenage Nong Toom enrolls in an elite training camp run by a tough coach and soon begins winning local matches across the country. When Nong Toom's trainer catches his young charge playing with makeup, he matter-of-factly decides to mine the boy's eccentricity as a publicity stunt, and soon Nong Toom is winning matches dressed in drag, greeting his opponents with a lipsticked kiss on the cheek. ''Beautiful Boxer'' at times feels repetitive and haltingly paced, but its blazing emotional core is the real-life kickboxer Mr. Suwan's joyously physical performance as Nong Toom.  DANA STEVENS    'BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE' Starring AnnaSophia Robb and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Wayne Wang. (PG, 97 minutes) Were it not for a couple of cars, a little girl's pink poodle backpack and a reference to e-Bay, Mr. Wang's ''Because of Winn-Dixie'' could easily be mistaken for a film set in the 1950's. It has old-fashioned and heartwarming written all over it, in heavy black Magic Marker. Adapted from Kate DiCamillo's best-selling children's novel, this is the story of Opal Buloni (Ms. Robb), a very lonely 10-year-old since she and her father (Mr. Daniels), a minister, have moved to Naomi, Fla., a town so small (or odd) that church services are held in a convenience store. So when Opal sees a scruffy dog loose in a Winn-Dixie supermarket one day, she claims him, names him for the place they met and takes him home. Once Opal has Winn-Dixie at her side, she makes new friends easily. This is a harmless, pleasant comic drama, but elements that may have seemed delightfully eccentric in print take on unfortunate new tones when translated to film. Sometimes you can't tell the magic realism from the corn.  ANITA GATES    'BOOGEYMAN' Starring Barry Watson. Directed by Stephen Kay (PG-13, 86 minutes). There are a lot of close-ups of doorknobs and water faucets in Mr. Kay's would-be horror film. There is a supernaturally speedy killing accomplished with heavy-duty plastic wrap. There is frequent whooshing and rapid camera movement. Despite all of that, it isn't scary. Mr. Watson, of ''Seventh Heaven,'' plays Tim, a grown man who has been afraid of the boogeyman ever since he was 8, when something creepy sucked his father into a closet and out of this life. After his mother's death, Tim vows to spend a night in his childhood home to allay his fears, but, sure enough, the boogeyman is back and after him and everyone he cares about (well, an uncle and two girlfriends). The house is very creaky; so is the movie.  GATES    'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' Starring Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai. Directed by Gurinder Chadha (PG-13, 111 minutes). Because Ms. Chadha knows how to sell multiplex multiculturalism -- her last feature was ''Bend It Like Beckham'' -- the pitch for her new film probably ran something along the lines of: ''Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' recontextualized as a Bollywood musical (only shorter) and set against the backdrop of the new global economy.'' Whatever the case, the new film -- which transposes Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India, with layovers in swinging London and sunny Los Angeles -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. Think ''My Big Fat Sari Wedding'' tricked out with clumsy song-and-dance numbers and delivered with much finger-wagging about cultural tolerance. The kicker here being that the wagging finger belongs to the story's heroine, here called Lalita (Ms. Rai, radiantly beautiful but inert), and the object of her high-mindedness is none other than a wealthy American, Will Darcy (Mr. Henderson, just inert).  DARGIS    'CONSTANTINE' Starring Keanu Reeves. Directed by Francis Lawrence. (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Mr. Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. He is John Constantine, who travels back and forth between our world and the one below, working as a kind of freelance border guard, sending stray demons back into the fiery depths (where they appear to have cars). But something big is brewing, involving rebel angels, the son of Satan, and a whole lot of pseudo-biblical mumbo-jumbo. Assisting Mr. Reeves are Rachel Weisz, as a Los Angeles police detective whose sister has jumped off a roof, and Shia LeBoeuf as an eager dabbler in the occult. Tilda Swinton is the angel Gabriel, doing a bit of slumming after boffo work in Milton's ''Paradise Lost.''  A.O. SCOTT    'DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN' Starring Kimberly Elise, Tyler Perry and Cicely Tyson. Directed by Darren Grant. (PG-13, 116 minutes). This movie is so oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce. As the story of a cruelly abandoned wife's reascendance zigzags from soap opera to slapstick to church sermon and back, it goes from A to Z on the all-things-to-all-people meter: Cinderella meets Amos 'n' Andy in Sunday school, so to speak.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'DOWNFALL' Starring Bruno Ganz. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (No rating, 155 minutes; in German, with English subtitles). Mr. Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses around him, and the Red Army closes in. Surrounding him are his followers, some fanatically loyal, others wavering in the face of defeat, who must all play out the endgame of their ghastly world-historical project. Mr. Hirschsbiegel's film, taking place at the moment when the energies of Nazism turned from murder to suicide, is engrossing and well made, but it does not generate much feeling beyond a queasy, prurient fascination. Its most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. Those who turn away from Hitler at the bitter end are restored to innocence, when in fact they were loyal Nazis whose convenient disillusionment -- coming as Russian soldiers appeared over the horizon -- is treated as a heroic exercise of conscience.  SCOTT    'HITCH' Starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James and Amber Valletta. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Mr. Smith as a dating coach who helps hapless Manhattan men snag women much better looking than they are. His own head is turned by Ms. Mendes, playing surely the most kindly gossip columnist ever to grace the pages of a New York tabloid. Complications, as always, ensue, but nothing too challenging or painful, either for the central couple or for the audience. Mr. James, best known as the portly King of Queens on television, is around for comic relief as an especially needy client, who is smitten with the willowy Ms. Valletta.  SCOTT    'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (NC-17, 90 minutes). It was the image seen -- cheered and jeered, canonized and demonized -- around the world. In 1972 Linda Lovelace, nee Linda Boreman, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat,'' played the role that would bequeath her a tawdry and lasting celebrity. With a single act of extreme fellatio, this dazed and often confused 23-year-old became a pinup for the party animal's sexual revolution and, in time, a martyr in the crusade against pornography. But as is clear from this lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary, Ms. Boreman was also little more than a pawn, an empty vessel for opportunists from both sides of the pornography divide. The documentary is a ''slam, bam, thank you, ma'am'' trifle of an entertainment, one strategically packaged for Generation A.D.D.  DARGIS    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004. (It won Oscars for best picture, best director for Mr. Eastwood, best actress for Ms. Swank and best supporting actor for Mr. Freeman.)  SCOTT    * 'NOBODY KNOWS' Starring Yuya Yagira. . Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (PG-13, 141 minutes; in Japanese, with English subtitles). Based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in a small Tokyo apartment, Mr. Kore-eda's fourth film is at once harrowing and tender, an urban horror story with overtones of fairy tale. Restricting himself to the children's point of view, the director creates an almost unbearable sense of dread in the audience; you can't help suspecting that, at every moment, something terrible is about to happen. But at the same time, because the children themselves do not perceive the full terribleness of their situation, the terror is mitigated by a sense of wonder and adventure. The keys to this meticulous and deeply humane film are Mr. Kore-eda's deft camera sense and the remarkable performance of the 12-year-old Mr. Yagira as Akira, the oldest of the four siblings, who must somehow preserve his own innocence while protecting his more vulnerable brother and sisters.  SCOTT    'ONG BAK: THE THAI WARRIOR' Starring Tony Jaa. Directed by Prachya Pinkaew (R, 101 minutes; in Thai, with English subtitles). Martial arts for purists who disdain wirework, computer-generated imagery and digital tweaking. Ting (Mr. Jaa) a country bumpkin trained in the deadly art of Thai Muay, travels to Bangkok to retrieve the stolen head of his village Buddha. Once there, his peaceful disposition is challenged by all manner of thugs and lowlifes. The story is beside the point: like the low-budget Hong Kong action pictures of the 1970's, this movie offers scrappy, ingenious fight choreography. The director is so enamored of some sequences that he treats himself -- and the audience -- to instant replays.  SCOTT    'POOH'S HEFFALUMP MOVIE' With the voices of Jim Cummings, John Fiedler and Kyle Stanger. Directed by Frank Nissen. (G, 63 minutes). In A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, Piglet once thought he had seen a heffalump, but it was really just Pooh with a honey jar stuck on his head. In this adorable animated film, he and the other animals finally encounter the real thing. And it (Lumpy, the baby heffalump) is too cute for words, largely thanks to the endearing voice and infectious laugh of 8-year-old Kyle Stanger. The plot involves Roo capturing Lumpy (who thinks a visit to the Roo's part of Hundred Acre Wood sounds like a fine game) and Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore and company learning that Heffalumps aren't scary at all. There is a dash of child-pleasing animated slapstick, a few nice Carly Simon songs and a crucial lesson about the dangers of misjudging people just because they are different from you.  GATES    'SON OF THE MASK' Starring Jamie Kennedy. Directed by Lawrence Guterman. (PG, 86 minutes) Tim Avery (Mr. Kennedy) is a would-be cartoonist and full-time schlemiel, stuck at a low-level job at a cutting-edge animation company. Tim chances upon a wooden mask that his dog, Otis, dragged home. As viewers of the original 1994 film ''The Mask'' will know, this artifact is the property of Loki, the Norse god of mischief. Whoever dons it immediately becomes a computer-animated whirlwind of obnoxious egotism and untrammeled desire. In short order, Tim has gotten himself promoted at the company and impregnated his wife (Traylor Howard). But alas, their son, Alvy, is ''born of the Mask'' -- he's a semi-digitized superbaby, capable of shape-shifting, tap-dancing and feats of superhuman strength. When Loki (Alan Cumming) decides to come back for his mask, Tim is in for a roller-coaster ride of manic chase scenes and computer-assisted mayhem. Youngsters will suffer no lasting harm from this frantic, grating spectacle, but their less resilient parents may not be so lucky.  STEVENS    *'SUNSET STORY' With Irja Lloyd and Lucille Alpert. Directed by Laura Gabbert. (No rating, 73 minutes). I hesitate to describe the pocket-size documentary ''Sunset Story'' as a gem of a film. Lovingly directed by Ms. Gabbert, it is certainly a gem, small and, in its very modest way, perfect of its kind. But there is every reason to believe that the film's subjects -- an elderly twosome named Lucille and Irja -- would find the word gem overly precious, perhaps insulting. These are women, after all, who regularly participate in protests and union rallies, and whose home is adorned with a sign reading ''Free Mumia,'' on behalf of the death row celebrity Mumia Abu-Jamal. The Mumia sign hangs off a metal railing overlooking the courtyard of a residence called Sunset Hall, which advertises itself as ''a nonprofit retirement home for free-thinking elders.'' No kidding! Founded in Los Angeles more than 80 years ago, Sunset Hall was established as a home for religious liberals. As the filmmakers soon make apparent, however, the current residents tend to lean rather more left.  DARGIS    'UP AND DOWN' Starring Petr Forman and Emilia Vasaryova. Directed by Jan Hrebejk. (R, 108 minutes; in Czech, with English subtitles). This engaging, unruly mix of comedy and melodrama follows the mood swings suggested by its title. Tracing the generally unhappy doings of a dozen or so loosely connected people in contemporary Prague, it skips from buoyant satire to domestic melodrama, leaving behind a curious mix of emotions. It is not often you see a movie so bracingly pessimistic about the human condition that dispenses its dose of bad news with such good cheer. A baby is illegally adopted by a former soccer hooligan; an émigré returns for a reunion with his broken family -- all in an atmosphere of petty crime, anxiety about immigration and general puzzlement at the state of the world (or at least the Czech Republic) -- 15 years after the end of Communism.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * BAD BOY BILL, DERRICK CARTER, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)807-7780. The popular house DJ Bad Boy Bill (who packs dance floors by using brute rhythmic force) is the headliner, but don't be surprised if Mr. Carter spins a more exciting, unpredictable set. Mr. Carter loves to enliven his thwacking house beats with squiggles and squelches; on ''Live at Om'' (Om), an appealing double-CD that also includes a set by Mark Farina, Mr. Carter gravitates toward robotic bass lines, disembodied voices and scrambled snippets of disco and jazz. Tomorrow night after 10, with Steve Smooth, DJ Dalton and Christine Renee; tickets are $30.  KELEFA SANNEH    LOU BARLOW, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703. Mr. Barlow, best known as the prime mover behind the indie-rock band Sebadoh, inspired many of the punk-influenced confessionalists who went on to find success (more success, perhaps, than he himself ever found) by pouring their hearts out in emo bands. The title of Mr. Barlow's new solo album, ''Emoh'' (Merge) is both an acknowledgment of this unpaid debt and a backward reference to one of the album's main themes. It's a rather baggy, sometimes meandering album, but Mr. Barlow's best love songs still find unexpected links between sentimentality and cynicism. Sunday night at 8:30, with Graham Smith and Mike Ferraro; tickets are $10.  SANNEH    * BONNIE (PRINCE) BILLY & MATT SWEENEY, Sound Fix, 110 Bedford Avenue, at North 11th Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)388-8090; Kim's Mediapolis, 2906 Broadway, at 113th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 864-5321; Built By Wendy, 7 Centre Market Place, near Broome Street, NoLita, (212)925-6538; Mondo Kim's, 6 St. Mark's Place, near the Bowery, East Village, (212) 598-9985. Other Music, 15 East 4th Street, East Village, (212) 477-8150. Bonnie (Prince) Billy is the indie-rock mainstay Will Oldham (aka Palace, among other things), who writes eerie, country-influenced songs. For a new collaborative CD, ''Superwolf'' (Drag City), Mr. Sweeney, an inventive guitarist, composed songs around a set of lyrics Mr. Oldham sent him; the two recorded the results together, and the album they made is a glimmering minor masterpiece. The two are to play New York City tomorrow, but no proper concerts are on the rather perverse itinerary: instead, city residents can take their pick from no fewer than five in-store appearances, which should get progressively stranger and more unraveled. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. (Sound Fix), 3 p.m. (Kim's Mediapolis), 5 p.m. (Built by Wendy), 7 p.m. (Mondo Kim's), and 9 p.m. (Other Music); admission to all appearances is free.  SANNEH    BREAKING BENJAMIN, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. This grim-faced metal-grunge band sings about betrayal and alienation over bruising, down-tuned guitar riffs on its way to pop choruses. Like many other current bands, it owes a lot to Tool, but its edge comes from its collaborator in songwriting: Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins. Tonight at 8, with Theory of a Deadman and the Exies opening; tickets are $20.  JON PARELES    * SOLOMON BURKE, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Solomon Burke is a larger-than-life, gospel-rooted 1960's soul man whose vocal jabs taught Mick Jagger, among others, a few things about singing. He is still a vocal powerhouse, full of dramatic whims, who earns the right to perform from a throne. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35.  PARELES    CALLA/PALOMAR, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. Calla makes its musical home in the after-hours New York of the Velvet Underground, the haggard despair of Joy Division and the California retreats of Neil Young. Its songs brood amid tolling, inexorable guitar riffs haunted by the blues. Whimsy and sinew coexist nicely in the lean, peppy pop-rock of Palomar, a three-woman, one-man band whose songs jump from blithe choruses to wiry guitar patterns to hefty distortion, all at the service of the lyrics' articulate ambivalence. Tonight at 8:30, with the Stands and Eastern Conference Champions opening; admission is $10.  PARELES    VINICIUS CANTUARIA AND MARC RIBOT, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Vinicius Cantuaria, a Brazilian songwriter who has lived in New York since the mid-1990's, is steeped in the bossa nova: its gently brushed guitar chords, its quietly elaborate melodies, its shades of sensuality and melancholy. He knows the style well enough to stretch the form without losing its essence, and tonight he's performing with Marc Ribot, a guitarist who's equally at home with old Cuban tunes or the clanky, twangy sounds he brought to Tom Waits's band. Sunday night at 9, admission is $15.  PARELES    CHEVELLE/HELMET, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732)238-5500 and the Chance Theater, 6 Crannell Street, Poughkeepsie, (845) 471-1966; the show was formerly scheduled at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, 14 Civic Center Plaza, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (845)454-5800. The muscular despair of grunge and the desolate, sinewy ballads of Tool live on in the grim, down-tuned, power-chorded dirges of Chevelle. Sharing the bill is the long-running New York band Helmet, a 1990's pioneer of sparse, deliberate, misanthropic hard rock. They're headlining the Snocore tour, which also includes the hard-rock bands Crossfade, Future Leaders of the World and Strata. At Starland Ballroom tonight at 7; tickets are $18. At the Chance Theater Sunday at 5; tickets are $23.50.  PARELES    CLEM SNIDE, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. This formerly local band (leader Eef Barzelay recently moved from Brooklyn to Nashville) just released ''End of Love'' (spinART), another CD full of wistful indie-rock songs that are sometimes clever and sometimes merely jokey -- the countryish ''Jews for Jesus Blues'' is barely better than its title. Tomorrow night at 9, with Marbles (aka. Robert Schneider from the Apples in Stereo) and Archer Prewitt; tickets are $13 in advance, $15 at the door.  SANNEH    * DR. DOG, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. This emerging Philadelphia band, enamored of light-headed riff-rock and off-kilter ballads, canceled a January appearance at this club because of a snowstorm. The members are to try again tomorrow night, in front of their small (but growing) cult of fans. On March 15, the group is to reissue its charming recent album ''East Beat,'' through National Parking Records. The album includes nine songs filled with breezy vocal harmonies and unexpected digressions, but the group's live show is much louder and more exuberant, especially when Scott McMicken unleashes one of his wailing, shape-shifting guitar solos. Tomorrow night at 9 (get there early -- Dr. Dog is the opening act), with the Centro-matic and the Baptist Generals; tickets are $10.  SANNEH    JOHN EDDIE, Stone Pony, 913 Ocean Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732)502-0600. John Eddie followed Bruce Springsteen up from the Jersey Shore in the mid-1980's, but never reached the arenas. Instead, he has settled into a career of steady performing at clubs, and his 2003 album, ''Who the Hell Is John Eddie?'' (Lost Eddie), shows he has a sense of humor about it, along with plenty of empathy for life's also-rans. Tonight, one ticket covers two sets at 8:30 and 11:30; admission is $15.  PARELES    * MASTERS OF PERSIAN MUSIC: MOHAMMED REZA SHAJARIAN, HOSSEIN ALIZADEH, KAYHAN KALHOR, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Time Warner Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)545-7536. The singer Mohammed Reza Shajarian is one of Iran's most celebrated classical singers, and he is joined on their third United States tour together by Hossein Alizadeh on tar (lute) and Kayhan Kalhor on kemancheh (spike fiddle) in new pieces rooted in the improvisations of Persian classical music and mystical Sufi poetry. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $30 to $50, or $26 to $45 for World Music Institute members.  PARELES    MIN XIAO-FEN, SUSIE IBARRA AND OKKYUNG LEE, BAM Cafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue at Ashland Place, Brooklyn, (718)636-4139. Min Xiao-Fen has brought the pipa, the Chinese lute tradtionally used for dramatic, virtuosic evocations of nature, into new music as well as the traditional repertory. She's joined by the improvising percussionist Susie Ibarra, a mainstay of the downtown avant-garde, and the cellist Okkyung Lee, in a concert of solos, duos and trios. Tonight at 9; admission is free with a $10 minimum.  PARELES    MICK MOLONEY'S IRISH-AMERICAN MUSIC AND DANCE FESTIVAL, Skirball Center, 566 LaGuardia Place, (212)992-8484. Mick Moloney has been a linchpin of traditional Irish music in New York City: not just singing it and playing it on tenor banjo and mandolin, but producing albums, documenting traditional musicians and encouraging younger generations. This program is devoted to Irish musicians in America. It includes the singer and songwriter Tommy Sands; an All-Ireland harp and concertina champion, Michelle Mulcahy; the fiddler and banjo player Bruce Molsky; the button accordionist Billy Comiskey playing music of his mentor, Sean McGlynn, the uilleann piper Jerry O'Sullivan, the fiddlers Athena O Lochlainn and Dana Lyn, the guitarist Eamon O'Leary and the stepdancer Niall O'Leary. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $40, $22.50 to $36 for those 65+.  PARELES    MAURA O'CONNELL, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. An Irish singer whose voice is suffused with melancholy warmth, Maura O'Connell chooses songs from the most heartfelt songwriters on both sides of the Atlantic and fills them with kindly empathy. Tomorrow night at 7; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 tomorrow.  PARELES    SASHA, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. Sasha, the wildly popular progressive-house D.J., comes to town for his monthly residency at Crobar. He has a knack for pleasing huge crowds without (for the most part) pandering to them: eschewing both the obvious and the unusual, he tops his steady, thumping beats with complicated electronic patterns that slowly decay and mutate. Tonight after 10, with James Zabiela; tickets are $30.  SANNEH    * JILL SCOTT, Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street, (212)632-4000. Jill Scott spills out words, spoken like hip-hop poetry or sung with jazzy timing, to detail the aspirations and loves of a sensual, intelligent and self-assured woman. Fresh from winning a Grammy award, she should have plenty of exuberant insights. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $40 to $67.50  PARELES    * SECRET MACHINES, Irving Plaza, 7 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. The slowly unfolding, keyboard-driven compositions of Secret Machines have a stark minimalist side, a glimmer of country, some pulsating and a streak of Pink Floyd grandeur that swells to fill the room. There's a haunted undercurrent amid the pomp. Show tomorrow night at 8 is sold out. Sunday night at 8, with Corecraft (including J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr.) and Autolux opening; tickets are $18.50 in advance, $20 Sunday.  PARELES    THE SHIRELLES, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536. Girl groups from the Supremes to Destiny's Child owe something to the Shirelles, who wrote their first hit, ''I Met Him on a Sunday,'' and had a string of hits in the early 1960's including ''Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow'' and ''Dedicated to the One I Love.'' This trio is led by Beverly Lee, the original Shirelle member who holds the trademark to the group name. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 and $35.  PARELES    SHONEN KNIFE, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. The female Japanese band Shonen Knife has been blasting out its primitive, cheerful punk squall for 20 years, and it hasn't gotten slick yet. Tomorrow night at 11, with Visqueen and Int'l Shades opening; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow.  PARELES    SLIPKNOT, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900. Slipknot's music is a barrage of high-speed drumbeats and howling vocals, combining the pandemonium of Slayer and the turntable cacophony of Public Enemy with infrequent melodic interludes akin to Nine Inch Nails; lately, it has tried to raise the melody quotient enough to suit radio programmers, with mixed results. But its anthems of adolescent resentment can still draw arena crowds, particularly when it shares the bill with the up-and-coming, virtuosically whipsawing metal bands Lamb of God and Shadows Fall. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $33.  PARELES    * TRIPLE R, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, lower level; information, www.klever.org/thebunkernyc/#upcoming. Triple R is Riley Reinhold, the German D.J. (and music critic) behind ''Friends'' (Kompakt), an excellent mix CD from 2002 that stitched together minimal but warm electronic tracks to evoke the outline of a single day, starting and ending with peaceful sleep. His latest mix CD is ''Selection 3'' (www.traumschallplatten.de), a hazy but propulsive compilation of tracks from his record label Trapez. The basement of this beleaguered downtown nightclub Tonic (visit tonicnyc.com to learn more about its struggle to survive) is no one's idea of an ideal dance-music venue, but expect Triple R to spin an ecstatic, immersive set, regardless. Tonight after 9, with Smartypants, Marcos Cabral and more; admission is $5.  SANNEH    DAVID WILCOX/RAY BONNEVILLE, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. David Wilcox has a handful of sterling folk-pop songs, a genial voice and enough guitar virtuosity to make even his lesser material sound convincing. He shares the bill with Ray Bonneville, who picks ragtimey blues on electric guitar. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $20 in advance, $23 Sunday.  PARELES    * YERBA BUENA, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236. Yerba Buena meshes traditional rumba rhythms, and other African-diaspora styles from boogaloo to Afrobeat to jazz, with gutsy, distorted guitars to create pan-American and pan-African party music that has both sly intelligence and deep roots. Tonight at 8, with the Pacha Sound System and L'Negro; admission is $15.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    * BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    CHITA RIVERA, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212)339-4095. Broadway's ageless gypsy queen has a voice so lived-in that its cardboard tatters often seem patched together with chewing gum, scotch tape and paste, but that doesn't mean that she can't sing up a dramatic storm if the song demands it. Except for a silly gender-reversed his-hers medley of show tune fragments swapped with her pianist Mark Hummel, her show, ''And Now I Sing'' finds a likable mixture of sass and sentiment that reaches its height with a shimmying ''All That Jazz,'' a song from ''Chicago'' that she owns now and forever. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11 p.m. Cover: $60; $40 minimum early shows, $30 late shows.  HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra''' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogers-esque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30; $20 at the bar; $10 minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    WESSELL ANDERSON QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. A longtime member of Wynton Marsalis's Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, the alto saxophonist Wessell Anderson has a warm, sweet tone; his playing can be radiant with soul and happiness. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  BEN RATLIFF    * RAVI COLTRANE QUINTET, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)582-2121. The saxophonist Ravi Coltrane has taken his time to warm up, and his new album new ''In Flux'' (Savoy Jazz) shows that he's gotten somewhere good. He enlists different approaches: mysterious, moving ballads; short free-jazz scrimmages; free improvisation within tight rhythmic structures; rubato, layered time signatures, and the rhythmic complexities of the new Latin jazz, negotiated with the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer E.J. Strickland. It's a good representation of what jazz in New York sounds like right now. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 tonight and Sunday night, $32.50 tomorrow night, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    DON FRIEDMAN TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. The pianist Don Friedman has been leading his own groups since the early 60's, when he was a West-Coaster, soon to move to New York and collaborate with Booker Little, Jimmy Giuffre and others. More recently he's been a permanent part of Clark Terry's band, finessing standards. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover, $25 tonight and tomorrow night, $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    ROSARIO GIULIANI QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. An Italian alto saxophonist with a long-standing group, Rosario Giuliani's rare appearance in New York is part of ''Jazzitaliano,'' a citywide arrival of Italian jazz in New York. Sets through Sunday night are at 9, 11 and 12:30; no cover charge.  RATLIFF    BENNY GREEN TRIO, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)258-9595. A strong mainstream pianist with a dominant Oscar Peterson influence, Benny Green is keeping the glories of mid-century jazz at the surface of his music; he'll play this weekend with Ray Drummond on bass and Rodney Green on drums. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    CHRISTIAN McBRIDE BAND, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-3080. One of the most virtuosic jazz musicians to emerge during the 1990's, the bassist Christian McBride indulges his interests in straight-ahead jazz as much as funk and pop and other areas. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    BEN MONDER, Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177. A regular with bands led by musicians like Paul Motian and Lee Konitz, as well as a powerfully inventive guitarist in his own material, Mr. Monder plays widespread chords you've never heard, frequently going into a kind of gentle outer-space music. Tonight at 9; cover charge is $5.  RATLIFF    MADELEINE PEYROUX, Town Hall, 123 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-1003. A vocalist who emerged in the mid-90's from singing in the New Orleans streets, Ms. Peyroux could inhabit Billie Holiday and Édith Piaf, doing the tragic, pinched-voice thing perfectly. She still can and does -- that little voice remains somehow central to her -- but on ''Careless Love,'' her recent album and her first in eight years, she enlarges and updates the repertory, wading into the Elliott Smith and Jesse Harris catalogs. Tomorrow night at 8 pm; tickets are $35 and $50.  RATLIFF    * PLANET JAZZ, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212)675-7369. It's the first weekend of the reappearance of Smalls -- the little jazz club that nurtured talents through the 90's including Kurt Rosenwinkel, Mark Turner, Peter Bernstein, Avishai Cohen and Jason Lindner. (It has a liquor license now, but you're still invited to stay all night once you arrive.) Planet jazz is a cooperative band including Smalls regulars like Mr. Bernstein, Joe Magnarelli, Grant Stewart, Spike Wilner and Neal Miner. Tonight and tomorrow night beginning at 10 p.m., with sets running until 5 a.m.; cover charge is $10, with a two-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    ANDREW RATHBUN LARGE ENSEMBLE, Smith's Jazz Bar, 701 Eighth Avenue, at 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)246-3268. The saxophonist and composer Andrew Rathbun is using some of the better musicians in the New York scene for his smart, harmony-rich big-band music; he is also working with literary texts. Here he'll be playing all new music for large ensemble including the premiere performance of an extended work with text by Margaret Atwood, ''The Two Islands Suite''; the excellent Claudia Acuna will be singing. Sunday at 9 pm; $10 cover, with a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    BENNY POWELL 75th BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. The trombonist Benny Powell, a longtime associate of Randy Weston and a carver of strong melody, is a local favorite; he spreads good will through a club. Musicians include T.K. Blue on saxophone and flute, Earl May on bass, and Vinnie Johnson on drums. Tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set, $10 for members.  RATLIFF    * NED ROTHENBERG, Location One, 20-26 Greene Street, SoHo, (212)334-3347. Over the last 25 years the improviser Ned Rothenberg has been developing his solo performances on saxophone, bass clarinet, shakuhachi and other wind instruments; they are elegant, diverse, full of strong ideas in tone and texture, to the point where his impressive technique almost becomes a side-issue. Tomorrow at 8:30; admission is $12; students and 62+, $8.  RATLIFF    ARTURO SANDOVAL, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Mr. Sandoval, the expressive Cuban trumpeter, always looks as if he's having fun onstage; he's in love with his own virtuosity. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $30 at the tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum at the tables and a one-drink minimum at the bar.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' Several of the singers singing in tonight's performance of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia'' appeared in their roles earlier this season when the Metropolitan Opera brought back its charming production by John Cox. So, you can depend on the appealing tenor Matthew Polenzani, singing Count Almaviva, and the rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Katarina Karneus to deliver the goods. The big news of the night was going to be the Met debut of the young Italian baritone Franco Vassallo as the barber, Figaro. But Mr. Vassallo is ill, and will be replaced by Earle Patriarco. Carlos Chausson sings Dr. Bartolo, Ferruccio Furlanetto sings Don Basilio, and the conductor Maurizio Benini will be in the pit. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $210.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'CANDIDE' There's a lot of Lenny going around: a recent fine radio series about his life and work, the DVD release of some of the Young People's Concerts, and now, following more or less on the heels of the New York Philharmonic last season, another ''Candide.'' City Opera is devoting most of the next two weeks to a revival of its own Hal Prince production of Bernstein's flawed but tenacious classic, with some good young voices including William Ferguson, an admirable tenor, in the title role. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, tomorrow afternoon and Sunday afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Remaining tickets: $27 to $105.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'SAMSON ET DALILA' The portrayal of Samson by the Argentine tenor José Cura is the main reason to see the Metropolitan Opera's revival of its 1998 production by Elijah Moshinsky. Mr. Cura had not been back to the Met since his 1999 debut, and in the years since he has maximized his strengths and minimized his shortcomings as a singer. Though purists will still fault his vocal rawness and sometimes rough legato, he gives his all in this role, singing with passion, burnished sound, fearless attack and energy. And with his hunky physique and bold physicality, he commands the stage. Though the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves is a gorgeous and alluring Dalila, and her rich and warm voice is ideal for the role, her singing on opening nights was sometimes shaky and insecure. Bertrand de Billy was the impressive conductor. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out; returned tickets may be available before the performance.  TOMMASINI    Classical    BALTIMORE CONSORT This ensemble, best known for its many fine recordings for the Dorian label (which recently folded), is performing ''Cancionero!,'' a program of Spanish songs and dances from around 1500, as well as improvisations on popular themes from the time. Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212)650-2290. Tickets: $35.  ALLAN KOZINN    BARGEMUSIC If the one-voice-to-a-part performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion by the New York Collegium isn't sufficiently minimalist for you, a competing Bach concert tonight at this floating concert hall on the East River offers all six of Bach's Suites for Unaccompanied Cello. It's a lot of music for a single cellist to play at one sitting (although it's been done), so Bargemusic is splitting the set between two, Amy Sue Barston and Amir Eldan. A more varied program is offered tomorrow and Sunday, when the violinsts Yuval Waldman and Robin Zeh are joined by Kathleen Foster, a violist, and David Calhoun, a cellist, in a program that includes Gershwin's Lullaby for String Quartet, Janacek's ''Intimate Letters'' Quartet and works for solo violin by Biber and Bartok. The Bach Cello Suites are tonight at 7:30; the quartet program is tomorrow at 7:30 and Sunday at 4. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083. Tickets: $35; $20 for students.  KOZINN    'DOUBLES AND TRIPLES' The title refers not to Manny Ramirez's hits in the post-season but rather to a program this evening in Miller Theater featuring multiple string quartets piled together on a single stage. Mendelssohn's Octet is the quintessential example of a work for double quartet, but Darius Milhaud also had the ingenious idea of writing his Quartets Nos. 14 and 15 such that they could be played independently or at the same time. Steve Reich's ''Triple Quartet'' has a title that says it all. The piece often requires a single quartet to pre-record the other two parts, but Mr. Reich also permits three separate ensembles to tackle his score at once. That's just what will happen tonight as the Ying, the Pacifica and the Chiara String Quartets perform these works by Mendelssohn, Mihaud and Mr. Reich. Quartet traffic of this volume apparently requires something extra: a conductor, who will be Alan Pierson. Tonight at 8, Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $25; students $15.  JEREMY EICHLER    'THE END OF THE MOON' Billed as a departure, Laurie Anderson's latest evening-length performance piece actually uses new technology to traverse familiar terrain. In a sing-song lilt that smooths off the rough edges of what she's saying, the artist talks about a wide range of topics, some of them touching on her recent stint as NASA's first-ever artist-in-residence. The grab-bag includes anecdotes, aphorisms, stretches of self-consciously poetic meditation, and simple tunes on Ms. Anderson's electric viola, sampled into digital importance. Ms. Anderson celebrates the way that technology has shrunk, enabling her to fit all of her equipment into a couple of suitcases; unfortunately her content seems to have shrunk along with it. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 3, BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $50.  MIDGETTE    LOUIS LORTIE This Canadian pianist comes to Carnegie Hall tomorrow night with waltzing on his mind. His fascinating program has at heart Schubert's two sets of waltzes and their French mirror image, Ravel's ''Valses Nobles et Sentimentales.'' Liszt and Berlioz will do some three-in-a-measure dancing as well, and to add a more recent touch Mr. Lortie plays Helmut Lachenmann's Five Variations on a Theme of Franz Schubert. ''La Valse'' by Ravel also appears in its fiercely difficult reduction from orchestra to solo piano. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $24 to $79.  BERNARD HOLLAND    NEW YORK COLLEGIUM It's been more than two decades since Joshua Rifkin published his groundbreaking study of Bach's choral music, in which he demonstrated that Bach's choruses were not the huge assemblies many of us grew up hearing, or even the comparatively trim groups favored by period instrument ensembles, but a mere one singer to a part. Given the music's heft, to say nothing of its difficulty, this is difficult to imagine. The compensation for the loss of big-chorus grandeur is clarity of texture and line, always essential and illuminating in Bach. One musician who sides with Mr. Rifkin is Andrew Parrott, the English conductor who directs New York Collegium. With his orchestra and eight singers, Mr. Parrott is performing the St. Matthew Passion tonight, giving listeners a chance to decide whether they prefer their Bach towering or intimate -- or whether Mr. Parrott's performance offers some of both. Tonight at 8, Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212)717-9246. There is a pre-concert lecture by Daniel R. Melamed, a musicologist from the Indiana University School of Music, at 7. Tickets: $30 to $50.  KOZINN    NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY One of the best ways to reconnect with the adventure and excitement of works that have long been repertory staples is to hear them performed by eager and unjaded young musicians who are truly thrilled to be playing them. This always happens at the concerts by the excellent, highly skilled and hard-working New York Youth Symphony. So you expect Sunday afternoon's performances of two Tchaikovsky war horses, the Fifth Symphony and the Piano Concerto No. 1, conducted by Paul Maas, to be deeply rewarding. The soloist in the concerto is the brilliant Italian pianist Antonio Pompa-Baldi, winner of the Silver Medal at the 2001 Van Cliburn Competition. The orchestra also assures adventure by playing the premiere of short work by a young composer at every concert. Sunday's offering is ''The Nostalgia of the Infinite'' by Thomas Osborne. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $7 to $55.  TOMMASINI    PETER SERKIN AND BRAD LUBMAN The composer Oliver Knussen, who wrote ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' is a bit of a wild thing himself: hirsute and unpredictable, with a tendency to blow deadlines. Not only did he not manage to finish his latest new work for the pianist Peter Serkin and the Zankel Band; at the last minute illness prevented him from conducting the concert. Brad Lubman will step in to lead the wild and woolly program, which includes pieces by everyone from Mark-Anthony Turnage (''Snapshots'') to Charles Wuorinen (''Cyclops'') to the absent Mr. Knussen, still represented by two pieces, ''Two Organa'' and ''A Fragment of Ophelia's Last Dance.'' Never mind: Mr. Serkin is a fine pianist; the Zankel Band, a pack of crack soloists. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $32.  MIDGETTE    RUSSIAN CHAMBER CHORUS OF NEW YORK This group, directed by Nikolai Kachanov, has performed an invaluable service by focusing New Yorkers' attention on the great works written for the Russian Orthodox Church, especially those by the familiar masters Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. Here it presents mostly nonliturgical music: a celebration of the friendship of the great Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin and Rachmaninoff, including Rachmaninoff's cantata ''Spring,'' which had its premiere a century ago, with Chaliapin as soloist. In addition to more Rachmaninoff, the program offers music from Chaliapin's repertory, including works by Rossini, Gounod, Mussorgsky and Gretchaninoff. Tonight at 8, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street; tomorrow at 4 p.m., Broadway Presbyterian Church, at 114th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)928-1402. Tickets: $25; $15 for students and 65+.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    SILESIAN STRING QUARTET Contrary to popular belief, there is a Henryk Gorecki beyond that single work. This Polish composer's elegiac Third Symphony enjoyed overwhelming popularity and commercial success after the release of a now famous 1992 recording. This symphony, however, had been written back in 1976, and Mr. Gorecki has stayed active since then. His String Quartet No. 2 appears on this all-Polish program along with works by Karol Szymanowski and Andrzej Panufnik. Steeped in its native Polish repertory, the Silesian Quartet would seem up to the task. Tonight at 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $40.

Sunday at 3 p.m. 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, Lexington Avenue at 92nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500 or www.92ndsty.org. Tickets: $10.  DUNNING    DANCE BRAZIL The company director Jelon Veiera's new ''Retratos de Bahia,'' set to music by Tote Gira, draws from the work of Pierre Verge, the French photographer and anthropologist, and from the Capoeira, the Brazilian martial arts form that is a main ingredient in the dancing of this troupe. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $40.  DUNNING    DANCEMOPOLITAN This intimate, playful series continues with a program of work by 13 dance artists and groups and two surprise guests, including the trio of Stuart Hodes, Gus Solomons Jr. and Alice Teirstein (tonight only) and Paul Matteson and Brian Brooks (tomorrow only).

Mr. Siegal, who danced with William Forsythe's Ballett Frankfurt, will present a duet called ''If/Then,'' performed by Janis Brenner and Jeanine Durning, that records the changing relationship between a dying mother and her daughter.

DUNNING    * INTRODANS ENSEMBLE FOR YOUTH The accent is decidedly on youth in the presentations of this Dutch company from Arnhem. Freewheeling dances by such choreographers as Hans van Manen, Robert Battle, Ton Wiggers, David Parsons, Patrick Delcroix and Jiri Kylian feature deliberately mismatched ballroom dance partners, Mozart maniacs who glide about on wheels, a collision between a fuzzy torso and a some furry legs and games of hopscotch and tag for dancers in nightshirts. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 12 and 5 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Tickets: $10 to $30.  JACK ANDERSON    LKB DANCE Leah Kreutzer Barber's new ''excavations'' uses video to provide what Ms. Barber describes as a voyeuristic toll to isolate and elaborate her gestural vocabulary and women's experience. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Clark Studio Theater, 70 Lincoln Center Plaza, (732) 742-1523. Tickets: $25; $15 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    * AMANDA LOULAKI AND SHORT MEAN LADY Who needs to know anything about a company called Short Mean Lady? But for the literal-minded in the house, the four-member troupe performs dances by its director, Ms. Loulaki, that promise chaos, irony, sarcasm and political commentary, with video on the side in the new ''La la la la, Resistance (The Island of Breezes).'' Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $20.  DUNNING    PERU NEGRO A troupe from Lima dedicated to preserving Peru's rich black cultural traditions offers earthy music and soulful dancing. The vibrant accompaniment features many unusual percussion instruments. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Jazz at Lincoln Center, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 545-7536. Tickets: $25 to $48.  ANDERSON    NEW GENERATION DANCE COMPANY Directed by Dardo Galletto, who has performed with Julio Bocca's Ballet Argentino, the company will present ''Aires de Tango,'' a program of traditional tango and fusion choreography. Discussion (tonight), wine-tasting (tomorrow night) and tango classes (Sunday afternoon) will follow the performances. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Harry De Jur Playhouse, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (917)370-4628. Tickets: $25 to $45.  DUNNING    '92 ON 42': BRIDGMAN/PACKER DANCE Art Bridgman and Myrna Packer have collaborated as choreographers and performers for 27 years. In their new ''Under the Skin,'' the two bodies serve as screens and partners for electronic images with the aid of a ''live'' camera and prerecorded video. Live music will be provided by the composer and saxophonist Ken Field. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., the Dukeon 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+ with identification.  DUNNING    PRINTZ DANCE PROJECT The company director Stacey Printz will present new dances in a multimedia program that also includes beat boxing and rap by Felonious, a hip-hop collective from the Bay Area. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    BETH SOLL AND COMPANY A choreographer known for expressive, and occasionally enigmatic, works offers dances inspired by recent developments in American political life (including the invasion of Iraq), the deaths of friends and the struggles of immigrants to America. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30, Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (212) 304-1845. Tickets: $12.  ANDERSON    * PEGGY SPINA TAP COMPANY A genial tapper calls her programs ''Tap Sprees.'' They're certainly not quite like ordinary tap concerts. In fact, they rather resemble house parties. The setting is informal and relaxed. The dancers radiate good cheer. And the musicians, led by Joel Forrester, play with a minimum of amplification. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 6 and 8:30 p.m., Spina Loft, 115 Prince Street, SoHo, (212)674-8885. Tickets: $20.  ANDERSON    REFRACTIONS DANCE COLLECTIVE The company's resident choreographers will present ''Beloved -- An Evening of Dance and Sufi Poetry.'' Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., CRS, 123 Fourth Avenue, between 12th and 13th Streets, East Village, (212)677-8621. Tickets: $13.  DUNNING    'TANGO PASIÓN' Tango dancers and singers will do their stuff to instrumental music provided live by the Latin Grammy Award-winning orchestra Sexteto Major. Sunday at 7 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, Long Island University, C.W. Post campus, Route 25A, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100 or www.tillescenter.org. Tickets: $38 and $50; $35 and $47 for 65+.  DUNNING    * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY Two premieres and some golden oldies and near-oldies will be performed in this first weekend of the company's three-week 50th anniversary season. Mr. Taylor's new ''Dante Variations,'' a dark-sounding work set to music by Ligeti, will have its New York premiere tonight. The more cheerful new ''Klezmerbluegrass'' will be performed tomorrow at both performances. Other highlights include Taylor classics ''Aureole'' and ''3 Epitaphs'' (tonight) and ''Company B,'' a bittersweet evocation of the World War II songs of the Andrews Sisters to which the piece is set. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $15 to $75.  DUNNING    NAMI YAMAMOTO Ms. Yamamoto, a resident artist this year at the Brooklyn Arts Exchange, will present ''the last word was PAPIREPOSE'' -- oh, these titles -- in which, the choreographer promises, small details, subtle emotional shifts and abrupt movement deviations will create understated landscapes. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Brooklyn Arts Exchange (BAX), 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Park Slope, (718)832-0018. Tickets: $8 to $15.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'CONTEMPORARY VOICES: WORKS FROM THE UBS ART COLLECTION.' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through April 25. What's wrong with this picture? The Museum of Modern Art, the most visionary museum of the 20th century, is inaugurating the temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with an exhibition of gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep the ensemble from feeling corporate, monotonous and by the book. The 40 (of 64) works given or promised to the Modern are nearly all by white male artists, and they are all already represented in the collection. There's nothing wrong with the individual works by artists like Philip Guston, Jasper Johns and Vija Celmins that won't be cured by integrating them into the Modern's collection, but the ensemble effect is dispiriting. With an emphasis on a narrow swath of the 1980's mainstream, the show feels like an excessively edited letter in a bottle from an art world that no longer exists. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students; children 16 and under and accompanied by an adult, free. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  ROBERTA SMITH    'RUTH DUCKWORTH, MODERNIST SCULPTOR,' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, through April 3. A sculptor whose basic medium is clay, Ms. Duckworth makes everything from tiny, delicate vessels to monumental outdoor sculptures. Though her work fits in -- but not too neatly -- with the modernist tradition, her eye has roamed everywhere, resulting in a bewildering variety of styles and influences, from Brancusi to a beef bone found in her soup. Sometimes the influences combine awkwardly, making her work seem a little strained and quirky, but often enough her venturesomeness pays off, producing images of eloquence and power. Hours: Daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $6 for 65+ and students. Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. is pay what you wish.  GRACE GLUECK    'FIRST SEEN: PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLES, 1840-1880,' Dahesh Museum of Art, 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212)759-0606, through May 1. Mothers nursing babies, vignettes of the Crimean War, high life under the British Raj, exploited child workers, holy men, Chinese women with bound feet, bare-breasted tribal women, Kirghiz tribesmen, Cossack hunters, American Indians and on and on, not to mention a snappy picture of the novelist George Sand in her accustomed male drag, wielding a cigarette. These are some of the 250 photographs taken all over the world by early lensmen. The idea of the show, chosen from the vast archives of the Wilson Center for Photography in London, was to focus on ''first'' glimpses of people rather than the more usual views of landscapes, mountains or relics that were easier subjects for the ponderous pioneer camera to handle. The profusion of images may cause the viewer's mind to boggle, but it gives a good idea of the worldwide sweep of the early camera's lens. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; $4 for 65+, students and educators.  GLUECK    * 'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to have been. A few of the paintings mustered as evidence are pretty strange; many are glorious. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.  HOLLAND COTTER    Galleries: Uptown    RICHARD HICKAM: 'BEYOND THE SURFACE,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, through March 26. The faces in this group of quirky Expressionist portraits slip and slide into grotesque masks under the artist's loose brushstrokes, rich textures and bold manipulations of color. But they hint at universals, like ''The Teacher,'' a particularly haunting welter of features that includes a strained toothy smile under a beaky nose, an unkempt thatch of straight, straw-colored hair and a dark scraggle of beard. The dyspeptic-looking ''Night Reader,'' with a yellowish head the shape of an Idaho potato held at a slight angle, a twisted gash of mouth and a pair of glasses that sit crookedly on the suggestion of a nose, evokes an aged and bedeviled aesthete (as well as the Wizard of Oz). At their peak, his faces seem to bare the souls of their wearers.  GLUECK    JOHN WALKER: 'COLLAGE,' Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550, through March 19. This English artist who now lives in Maine produced the six powerfully imposing Cubist collages featured here while living and teaching in New York in the mid-70's. Each measures 10 by 8 feet and has leathery surfaces of painted, irregularly cut-up pieces of canvas. Today they seem old fashioned, even a little academic. Still, the rumbling, viscerally physical energy they exude remains exciting.  KEN JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    'FACE TO FACE: DAN MASKS FROM THE IVORY COAST AND AQUATINTS BY HENRI MATISSE,' Pace Primitive/Pace Master Prints, 32 East 57th Street, (212)421-3237, through March 19. This first collaboration between the Primitive and the Print departments of this wide-ranging gallery, this show brings together Matisse's ultrasimplified female faces in aquatints from the 1940's and the refined, stylized late 19th-century and early 20th-century face masks from the Dan people of the Ivory Coast. While it can't be said that Matisse's aquatints here were directly influenced by them, his spare faces drawn with a hand so practiced it could conjure up an image with a few strokes, seem to owe something to the often subtle stylizations of African art. Of all African masks, those by the Dan, with their minimal but expressively carved features, and smooth modulation of facial planes, seem to go particularly well with his less-is-more renderings.  GLUECK    Galleries: SoHo    JOHN ALTOON: 'PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS, 1961-67,' Luise Ross Gallery, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212)343-22161, through April 16. In the last years of his short life, Altoon (1925-1969) broke out of the free-wheeling West Coast mode of Abstract Expressionism to zero in on more personal images that floated through his fantasy. One of the most amusing -- and accessible -- of these works is ''Untitled (Bathtub)'' of 1967, which could refer to Bonnard's endless renditions of his wife in the tub. It depicts a woman bathing as poodle bearing her shoe awaits her emergence. But her attention is riveted, hands clenching the tub in horror, on a small demonic man who has set fire to her bath water. Altoon's deft, light touch mates well with his fine sense of the silly.  GLUECK    ELEANOR ANTIN: 'ROMAN ALLEGORIES,' Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, 31 Mercer Street, (212)226-3232, through March 12. The role-playing Ms. Antin has brilliantly assumed identities from Nurse Eleanor, a take-off on Florence Nightingale, to Yevgeny Antinov, an exiled Russian moviemaker of the 1920's, in films, videos, photographs, performance and installation art. But for this sequence of 12 large-scale color photographs, she directs a cast of other performers who play a troupe of traveling actors, in ancient garb, wandering through landscapes dotted with picturesque ruins. Their various tableaus send up painters from Poussin to Bouguereau. The work may not reflect Ms. Antin at her most obsessively focused; sometimes it looks like a college dramatic society on its own without a director. But it doesn't detract from her reputation as one of the wittiest Conceptual artists going.  GLUECK    Galleries: Chelsea    TRICIA CLINE: 'SAINT AND EXILES FROM STORIES NEVER WRITTEN,' Ricco/Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212)627-4819, through March 19. This Woodstock, N.Y-based sculptor is self-taught, which shows in her otherworldly narratives but not in her remarkable technique, which looks like that of a well-trained but slightly eccentric Beaux Arts revivalist. Her pedestal-scale, unglazed porcelain sculpture features different versions of a young Everywoman in antique clothing with a totemic animal strapped to her back -- a bird, a giant mouse, a fox -- who seems to be embarked on some kind of supernatural pilgrimage.  JOHNSON    LLYN FOULKES: 'THE LOST FRONTIER,' Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212)627-3680, through March 19. The main attraction of this maverick Californian's first New York show since 1990 is a big, vehemently satiric multimedia picture about genocide, environmental destruction and the moral idiocy of mainstream American culture. A vast dump made of little toys and wood chips spills between cliffs made of mounds of dark paint inhabited by a mummified Indian and a dried hairless cat. A stupefied man watches television in the foreground and a gun-toting Mickey Mouse in a Victorian dress stands triumphantly at the summit of one rocky prominence.  JOHNSON    JAMES LITTLE: 'REACHING FOR THE SKY,' G.R. N'Namdi, 526 West 26th Street, (212)929-6645, through March 26. Mr. Little infuses 60's-style geometric abstraction with an expansive, sensuous new life. Using a mix of oil and wax on canvases as wide as nine feet, he creates hard-edged designs of diagonal and vertical bands and long triangles pointing up and down. The finely textured surfaces and pulsating colors effect visual and tactile seduction while the kinetic compositions project restless energies.  JOHNSON    SARAH LUCAS: 'GOD IS DEAD,' Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300., through March 14. In her brilliantly titled third solo show in New York, the most persistently grating talent of the original Y.B.A. (young British artists) generation adds religious and parental authority to her acidic depictions of male dominance. Her latest efforts, mobile-like figures made from pantyhose, wire hangers, bare light bulbs and buckets, dare you to accept them as art while managing to evoke dirty old men, vulnerable young women or both. The intimation of abuse is hard to miss, although too often what seems intended as subtlety turns into obscurity.  SMITH    CHRISTIAN MOELLER: 'HEAVEN,' Frederieke Taylor, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-0992, through March 12. A professor of design/media arts at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Moeller is known internationally for interactive sound, light and architectural installations. Here he presents a comparatively simple installation of fluorescent light works in which shadowy words like heaven, goat, lick, tryst and vodka emerge mysteriously from banks of thin, white parallel tubes. It is literally the brightest show in town.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    DONNA CHUNG AND LIZ LUISADA: '2 KOOL FOR MYSTERY SKOOL,' Klaus von Nichtssagend Gallery, 438 Union Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917)912-5482, through March 20. In a moment when dazzling drawing and collage skills are the norm, the double debut of these two Los Angeles artists and recent graduates of the Rhode Island School of Design still stands out. Ms. Chung, a creative materialist, favors collage, eccentric lettering, unusual found paper and additions or sparkle or tape. Ms. Luisada likes to work on wet paper, creating blurred patterns and images with a festive, lighted-from-within ephemeralness. Both borrow from popular cultures, whether Eastern or Western, past or present, and proceed with a freewheeling purposefulness that brings to mind Sigmar Polke. The gallery is new and named for a fictional person. ''Nichtssangend'' is German for ''It says nothing.''  SMITH    MICHAEL ZANSKY: ''AMERICAN PANOPTICON,' GAS, 59 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-6762, through March 12. Mr. Zansky assembles large plastic magnifying lenses, electronic motors, lights, mirrors, pipes, clamps and videos of busy microorganisms into kinetic sculptures that altogether tend not toward the comprehensive overview of the Enlightment idea of the ''panopticon'' but toward a dizzying, futuristic fragmentation of vision and consciousness.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    PAT ADAMS: 'PAINTINGS 1954 - 2004,' Zabriskie, 41 East 57th Street, (212)752-1223, closing tomorrow. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of her first solo show at this gallery, Ms. Adams's exhibition of small paintings takes an abbreviated look back over her long and distinguished career. Works from the last four decades typically feature richly textured fields punctuated by sharply defined abstract elements that seem to cavort like Platonic archetypes through the space of a universal collective consciousness.  JOHNSON    'BLUE,' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040, closing on Sunday. This cool, offbeat little show is made up of all-blue or mostly blue objects from the permanent collection, including, ceramics, quilts, Shaker ''gift drawings'' and some attractive portraits. In one, a chap named Jonathan Knight cuts a Romantic figure in an indigo dress coat and yellow striped pants, an outfit identified with the hero of Goethe's ''Sorrows of Young Werther.'' An 1830 watercolor of a boy named Frederick Buxton was done on the cheap. But while his blue suit has faded with time, his big, candid eyes are as blue as the day they were painted. They make a perfect conclusion to this chromatic take on American social history. Hours: Today, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Tomorrow and Sunday, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Admission: $9; students, 62+, $7.  COTTER    SANTE D'ORAZIO: 'PAM: AMERICAN ICON,' Stellan Holm, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, closing tomorrow. Pamela Anderson -- yes, that Pamela Anderson -- in all her pneumatic, mostly unclothed glory is the subject of large and surrealistically vivid photographs that were originally commissioned but not published by Playboy magazine. Students: discuss criteria for judging the value -- aesthetic and otherwise -- of these artworks.  JOHNSON    PETER HUJAR: 'NIGHT,' Matthew Marks, 523 West 24th Street, (212)243-0200, through tomorrow. A mythic aura surrounds the bohemian artist's life -- cut short by AIDS in 1987 -- of the influential Mr. Hujar, but the 43 nocturnal photographs presented by this exhibition are formally conventional. The many architectural studies are expertly made but anonymous and only the subject matter of other pictures -- cruisers in the park, partying drag queens and ruined buildings -- hints at what kind of artist he might have become had he had more time to develop.  JOHNSON    LOREN MADSEN: 'GODS AND DEMONS: AN INSTALLATION,' McKee, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)688-5951, closing tomorrow . Mr. Madsen is a sculptor who has invented ingenious ways to combine formalist abstraction and socially motivated conceptualism. A wooden sculpture is a kind of three-dimensional chart illustrating the statistical ages at which people are killed by handguns. The main installation, an oblique commentary on the global impact of organized religions, consists of strings of glass beads hung from the ceiling, with beads of different colors representing quantities of key religious words inventoried in a search of three million book titles.  JOHNSON    ALEKSANDRA MIR: 'NEW DESIGNS,' Roth Gallery, 160A East 70th Street, (212)717-9067, closing tomorrow. The ever-resourceful Aleksandra Mir designs her own antiwar pro-abortion campaign with posters proclaiming ''Be Gentle in Fallujah'' and ''Keep Abortion Legal,'' as well as small, slogan-bearing goody-bag items. But she takes a more ambivalent viewpoint with a series of drinking glasses printed with the faces of newborns that are identified as the reincarnations of various recently deceased celebrities. Mass culture has long borrowed the strategies of Conceptual Art; it is always nice to see artists borrow back.
