Harlem School for the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 864-4444.    Broadway    * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL' An eye-glazing attempt to resurrect Herman Wouk's 1953 courtroom drama, adapted from his novel ''The Caine Mutiny.'' Directed with metronome in hand by Jerry Zaks, and starring David Schwimmer, Tim Daly and Zeljko Ivanek, this workmanlike production gives few clues to the enduring appeal of Mr. Wouk's tale of a humdinger of a typhoon, some disappearing strawberries and a nut job memorably named Queeg (2:15). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HOT FEET'  A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LESTAT'  A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke syntheziers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice-versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THREE DAYS OF RAIN'  (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)    'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'BRUNDIBAR' and 'BUT THE GIRAFFE, A CURTAIN RAISER TO HANS KRASA'S 'BRUNDIBAR' Hans Krasa's ''Brundibar,'' a lively opera for children, performed 55 times in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, with a new English libretto by Tony Kushner and a curtain-raiser by him that explains its history. Maurice Sendak and Kris Stone designed the charming production (1:35). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO'  The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts. (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell)    'THE CONTRAST' Royall Tyler's slender 1787 romantic comedy -- one of the first professional American plays ever produced -- should be of more interest to historians than to theatergoers (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Scott Ellis's underpowered production of Joe Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which stars Alec Baldwin in a comedy sketch of a performance, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'FAUST, PARTS 1 AND 2' David Herkskovits and his Target Margin Theater's remarkable performers offer the extravaganza promised in the publicity. Faust is a circus of operatic scale, a fun house, a tango of poetry and theatrical and sonic wizardry whose virtuosity renders this work in all its surging strangeness, power and extravagant beauty (6:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore)    'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' This musical, based on a 1960 novel by Peter S. Beagle, tells of love in a cemetery that sounds a lot like Woodlawn in the Bronx. One set of would-be lovebirds is living, one recently deceased; the thin story needs a few more memorable songs. York Theater, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY'  This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    'MARY STUART' An earnest but uninspired revival that never quite captures either the romance or the tragedy of Schiller's play. There are some bright spots, but the production appears aimed more at visual effect than dramatic substance, and both queens seem to have the idea that monarchs exert authority simply by speaking loudly (2:40). The Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton)    'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SORE THROATS' Howard Brenton's scabrous 1979 drama about the bilious aftermath of a British marriage. Laila Robins and Bill Camp are a middle-aged, newly divorced couple warring over the past and the future. The play's insights into the irreducible conflict between human needs and the constraints of civilization are a little murky (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'GAUGUIN/SAVAGE LIGHT' George Fischoff, whose musical résumé includes a few pop hits from the 1960's (''Lazy Day,'' ''98.6''), does everything here: book, lyrics, music, piano playing. His young cast has a lot of energy, and Jeff Nardone as Paul Gauguin shows off a great voice, but the biographical treatment of this artist is too superficial (1:10). The Studio at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!'

(2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closing Sunday. (Hunka)    'THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST'  Lynn Redgrave is an unusually vigorous Lady Bracknell in Sir Peter Hall's new production of Oscar Wilde's peerless comedy from 1895. A satisfactory production that works effectively as a romantic farce but more erratically as a vehicle for Wilde's paradox-perfumed wit. (2:25) Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    * 'RELATIVITY' Cassandra Medley's play, the main offering of the First Light festival of science-themed works, offers plenty of food for thought about the uses and abuses of genetic science, but it offers fringe benefits as well: a couple of scalding scenes, and fine performances by Melanie Nicholls-King as a young black scientist who comes to question the black-superiority theories of her mother, and Petronia Paley as the noted researcher who takes her under her wing (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    * 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying. (Dana Stevens)    'AN AMERICAN HAUNTING' (PG-13, 83 minutes) Things go bump in the night in this 19th-century ghost story, but it's the bump of emptying seats, as audiences flee in boredom, that will haunt you for days. (Nathan Lee)    'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time, they plod through a grouchy attack on -- and example of -- the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (A. O. Scott)    * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden)    * 'THE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU' (R, 154 minutes, in Romanian) This Romanian film follows the grueling final hours of an ailing, alcoholic 62-year-old man in Bucharest, as he is shuttled among four city hospitals. A sustained triumph of ensemble acting, the film seems so absolutely real that it absorbs you into its world in the same way that a documentary like Frederick Wiseman's ''Hospital'' seeps into your consciousness. (Holden)    * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson, its writer and director, flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)    'GUYS AND BALLS' (R, 106 minutes, in German) In the German soccer comedy ''Guys and Balls,'' a baker's son (Maximilian Brückner) who is gay forms an all-gay team to defeat his hometown homophobes. Groaning with double-entendres and flaming gay stereotypes, the movie's climactic game offers some of the most sustained -- and literal -- gay bashing in movie history, even if the outcome is no more surprising than that of any other underdog comedy.Adam Sandler is probably already in training. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'HOOT' (PG, 90 minutes) Fourteen-year-old Roy Eberhardt is the new kid in the tiny Florida beach town of Coconut Cove. When he discovers that a local construction site is threatening the habitat of an endangered species of owls, Roy teams up with two local kids (Cody Linley and Brie Larson) to sabotage the building project, incurring the wrath of a national restaurant chain and baffling a clueless local cop named Officer Delinko (Luke Wilson). (Stevens)    * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Manohla Dargis)    'LADY VENGEANCE' (R, 111 minutes, in Korean) Park Chanwook completes his ''vengeance trilogy'' with this kinder, gentler exercise in pulp pyrotechnics and empty virtuosity. (Lee)    * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)    'THE LOST CITY' (R, 143 minutes) Andy Garcia's ode to the Havana of pre-Communist Cuba is a romantic epic manqué that swoons across the screen for nearly 2 1/2 hours without saying much beyond the fact that life sure was peachy before Fidel Castro came to town and ruined everything. (Holden)    'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)    * 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)    'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott)    * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Lee)    * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis)    'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)    * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)    'THE WHORE'S SON' (No rating, 86 minutes, in German) Michael Sturminger's unsentimental German-language debut feature fearlessly plumbs the depths of an intense mother-son relationship, in which Ozren (appearing at ages 3, 8 and 16) becomes more aware, as the years pass, that his beloved mother, Silvija, is a high-class prostitute. (Laura Kern)    'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)    Film Series    ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) This weekend's films at the Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work include ''Nashville'' (1975), the director's comment on the marriage of show business and politics; two episodes of ''Tanner '88,'' the pseudodocumentary mini-series with Michael Murphy as a golden but fictional presidential candidate; and ''Popeye'' (1980), with Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates)    B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's continues this weekend with two double features. The two Nicholas Ray films are ''They Live by Night'' (1949), with Farley Granger as a young escaped convict, and ''On Dangerous Ground'' (1952), starring Robert Ryan as a hardened city cop and Ida Lupino as the blind sister of a murder suspect. ''The Window'' (1949) is about a little boy who witnesses a murder in his upstairs neighbors' apartment, and ''The Web'' is a melodrama starring Edmond O'Brien as a bodyguard who kills a man, and Vincent Price as his not entirely honest employer. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)    BICYCLE FILM FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) Anthology Film Archives is playing host to this annual event. The bicycle-themed features include Jacob Septimus and Anthony Howard's ''B.I.K.E.,'' a profile of the Black Label Bicycle Club that includes scenes of tall-bike jousting; Mike Martin and Gabe Morford's ''M.A.S.H.,'' about fixed-gear riding in San Francisco; and Peter Sutherland's ''Pedal,'' a documentary about the harrowing lives of New York bicycle messengers. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village; $8.50 (online, $10.50). Free valet bike parking. (Gates)    KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's weekend series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Ran'' (1985), the director's award-winning interpretation of ''King Lear.'' The New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics and National Board of Review all named it best foreign film. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates)    REDISCOVERING ROSCOE: THE CAREER OF FATTY ARBUCKLE (Through Monday) The Museum of Modern Art's 54-film retrospective of the acting and directing career of the scandal-ridden Arbuckle (1887-1933) concludes with three ''Directing After the Scandal'' programs, including 1920's silents that Arbuckle directed under the name William Goodrich, and a career-recap program that includes a tinted print of ''Fatty and Mabel Adrift'' (1916). (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    SUNDANCE INSTITUTE AT BAM (Through May 21) The Brooklyn Academy of Music is celebrating the Sundance Institute's 25th anniversary with a series of events, including screenings of films from this year's Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The opening-weekend selections include ''The Short Life of José Antonio Gutierrez,'' a documentary about the first United States casualty in the war in Iraq; ''Stephanie Daley,'' a drama about a pregnant forensic psychologist and a teenage girl accused of infanticide, starring Tilda Swinton and Amber Tamblyn; ''TV Junkie,'' a documentary special jury prize winner; and ''Son of Man,'' which transposes Jesus' life to modern-day South Africa. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $10.    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ANGELS AND AIRWAVES (Monday and Tuesday) With Blink-182, superstars of boys-will-be-boys pop-punk, apparently defunct, its singer, Tom DeLonge, has put together a new band featuring members of Offspring and the Distillers. The band, sounding lean, aggressive and surprisingly sincere on its new album, ''We Don't Need to Whisper'' (Geffen), makes its New York debut. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Ben Sisario)    ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI (Thursday) If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like this Australian group: sunny, frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. At 8:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; $16.75 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)    * ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock 'n' roll needs to celebrate as well as ridicule its own mythology, and Art Brut, sarcastically but exuberantly singing about the thrill of plugging in and making a ruckus -- ''Formed a band, we formed a band/Look at us, we formed a band!'' -- is one of the rare groups that can do both. The band has programmed two nights of music on two stages at the Knitting Factory, with Think About Life, the Chalets, the Robocop Kraus and others. At 9 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $16. (Sisario)    SUSANA BACA (Thursday) Susana Baca has made musicological studies of Afro-Peruvian songs, but she has also followed her clear, knowing voice in less purist directions, fusing the modal delicacy of her Peruvian band with musicians versed in jazz and rock.

(Sisario)    DEPECHE MODE, GOLDFRAPP (Tomorrow) As in their 1980's heyday, Depeche Mode set pouting vocals against catwalk electronica that belies the music's blues-rock origins.

At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000 or (212) 307-7171; $35 and $85.

(Sisario)    CHRISTIAN MARCLAY (Wednesday) In the artworks and performances of Christian Marclay, pop music is not just a sound but also a collection of visual material -- vinyl discs, metal instruments, frangible leafs of sheet music -- that can be rearranged and remixed. For this performance, his film collage ''Screen Play'' will serve as a score to be interpreted live by two trios, one led by the veteran experimental guitarist Elliott Sharp, and the other by the cellist Okkyung Lee.

(Sisario)    MOGWAI (Tonight and tomorrow) Mogwai plays slow-motion pieces: three or four chords that meditate or build inexorably, with touches of dissonance and, perhaps, a conversation or an under-the-breath vocal attached.

At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20 in advance, $23 at the door.

Yamataka Eye is known for his endurance screaming and manic cartoon vocalizations with the Boredoms; Haino Keiji, of Fushitsusha, brings dark clouds of noise out of guitars and sometimes a hurdy-gurdy; and Makigami Koichi, the third visitor, is the leader of the long-running group Hikashu, which has played everything from techno to jazz. This is an extremely rare convergence, not to be missed. At 7:30, Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258; $30 and $35. (Sisario)    GENERAL PATTON VS. THE X-ECUTIONERS (Sunday) Mike Patton, the former singer of Faith No More, is one of the most versatile vocalists around -- which is to say that he can holler, squeal, croon and make like an operatic tenor or Daffy Duck with just about anyone.

At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171; $50 to $70. (Sisario)    SAM CHAMPION (Thursday) This local four-piece derives its shambolic jangle from Pavement, singing about being ''aggressively lazy'' -- the aggression comes in tense, muscular jabs of guitar that recall Neil Young. With the Comas, the Big Sleep and the Self Righteous Brothers. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $8 in advance, $10 at the door.

(Tommasini)    BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) This scrappy and usually interesting orchestra features two programs this weekend: first, Elvis Costello, who appears tonight as both orchestral composer (with a suite from ''Il Sogno'') and singer (with his own songs); second, a range of American music by Leonard Bernstein (the ''Jeremiah'' Symphony), Daniel Bernard Roumain (his ''Hip-Hop Essay'') and Thea Musgrave (the premiere of ''Remembering Harriet,'' a suite from her Harriet Tubman opera). At 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $25 to $80 tonight; $20 to $60 tomorrow. (Midgette)    CONCERTANTE (Thursday) This versatile chamber ensemble concludes its season with a concert of works by Mozart, Mendelssohn and Copland. Alexander Fiterstein (clarinet) and Xak Bjerken (piano) join as guest artists. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20. (Eichler)    * DBR AND THE MISSION (Tonight) The composer Daniel Bernard Roumain lives in several musical worlds, although to his way of thinking, they're all one, with manifestations that range from hip-hop to string quartets and symphonic works. His program at the Kitchen includes works for string quartet and laptop, for solo violin and for his electric chamber-funk band, the Mission. At 8, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; $10. (Allan Kozinn)    * EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Sunday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary, and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. They have been performing them all, in chronological order, and this is the final concert, with Quartets Nos. 13, 14 and 15. At 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)    DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY (Wednesday) This dashing Russian singer turns to the music he knows best, from Glinka and Borodin to Medtner and Rachmaninoff. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Holland)    LOS ANGELES GUITAR QUARTET (Tomorrow) Ensemble music for the classical guitar is notoriously tricky, if only because imperfectly unanimous attacks sound unduly chaotic. This ensemble plays with spectacular precision and offers a varied program that ranges from Renaissance works of Thomas Morley and transcriptions of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 and Copland's Two Mexican Pieces, to recent scores by Alfonso Montes, William Kanengiser, Andrew York and Vince Mendoza. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $40. (Kozinn)    MET ORCHESTRA (Sunday) The conductor James Conlon takes over for the injured James Levine in a program of Mozart, Tchaikovsky and assorted arias. Erika Sunnegardh, Ben Heppner and René Pape are the singers. At 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $46 to $155.(Holland)    MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) At the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Vermont, young musicians spend the summer with their more accomplished older colleagues, and to keep the spirit alive, ensembles of students and teachers tour during the season. This 2005-6 season, the Marlboro touring program is celebrating its 40th anniversary, and its series at the Met ends with a program of Mozart, Schumann and Schoenberg. At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Kozinn)    CHARLES NEIDICH AND CAROL WINCENC (Tonight) The Naumburg Foundation gave this clarinetist and this flutist prestigious awards earlier in their careers, and now presents them in a shared recital. Mr. Neidich is playing clarinet works by Berg and Schumann, as well as his own composition, and Ms. Wincenc is performing music for flute by Enescu, Fauré, Lukas Foss and others. Stephen Gosling joins on piano. At 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Eichler)    NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Thursday) Clara Longstreth, the music director of the estimable New Amsterdam Singers, once again shows her knack for fresh programming with a concert titled ''Invitation to the Voyage: Fifty Years of American Song.'' The evening offers choral settings of poetry from Solomon to Octavio Paz by composers including John Corigliano, Daniel Pinkham, Eric Whitacre, Ned Rorem and others. At 8, Immanuel Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 88th Street, (212) 842-1511; $20; $15 for 65+; $10 for students. (Tommasini)    PRISM CONCERTS (Sunday) Judith Clurman conducts ''Grappling with Their Heritage,'' a program of works by composers born into Jewish families, specifically Mendelssohn, Mahler and Castelnuovo-Tedesco. Performers include the soprano Deborah Voigt, the pianist Brian Zeger, the organist Colin Fowler and the Claremont Trio. At 7 p.m., Central Synagogue, Lexington Avenue at 55th Street, (212) 581-0400; $25. (Eichler)    DAVID ROBERTSON (Thursday) The American conductor and a various group called the Zankel Band play Berio, Ligeti and George Benjamin. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Holland)    ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tuesday) This finely polished choir of men and boys, conducted by John Scott, gives several superb concerts every season, with support from the period-instrument orchestra Concert Royal. The last for this year is devoted to Bach, with the Cantatas Nos. 106 and 118, and a motet from the ''Easter Oratorio.'' The soloists are Jolle Greenleaf, soprano; Robert Isaacs, countertenor; David Vanderwal, tenor; and Richard Lippold, bass. At 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360; $25 to $60. (Kozinn)    KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ (Sunday) The TriBeCa New Music Festival continues this weekend with a piano recital, if you can call it that, by the boundary-busting Kathleen Supové. There are avant-garde works by Randall Woolf, Julia Wolfe and John King, as well as ''Body of Your Dreams'' by Jacob ter Veldhuis, a multimedia piece built around the soundtrack of an exercise video. The most unusual selection looks to be ''Delta Space'' by Lukas Ligeti, which features the pianist in competition with a Yamaha Disklavier (a sort of super-high-tech player piano), fighting over the same keyboard. At 7 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, (212) 352-3101; $15. (Tommasini)    CAMILLA TILLING (Tonight) This gifted, lovely and appealing Swedish lyric soprano has been making the rounds of the world's major opera companies in recent years, including performances as Verdi's Nannetta and Mozart's Zerlina at the Met. Here she presents a recital with the pianist Julius Drake. Her program offers Nordic songs by Stenhammar, Sibelius and Grieg, as well as works by Strauss and Schubert. At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32. (Tommasini)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * 'BRINGING BALANCHINE BACK' (Sunday) This 2003 film records a visit by the New York City Ballet to St. Petersburg, George Balanchine's birthplace, where the company participated in the ''White Nights Festival'' and helped to celebrate the city's 300th anniversary. The program also includes Ulrik Wivel's ''I You Love/Jeg Dig Elsker,'' a short film, with Nikolaj Hubbe, about the mime and dramatic meaning of August Bournonville's ''Sylphide.'' At 4, 6:15 and 8:30 p.m. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600 or filmlinc.com; $10; $7 for students. (Jennifer Dunning)    CEDAR LAKE Contemporary Ballet (Tonight through Sunday) This ballet company's monthlong season continues with ''Hammer,'' a new ballet by the artistic director Benoit-Swan Pouffer.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. The other is ''Under Exposed,'' a three-night festival of new dance by choreographers chosen by Shannon Hummel and Monica Bill Barnes.

(La Rocco)    KO-RYO DANCE THEATER (Wednesday and Thursday) Sunhwa Chung will present four pieces, including one that uses Korean jump ropes, a Korean traditional dance solo and choreography performed to Korean poetry. (Through May 20.) At 8 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, between Rivington and Delancey Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444; $20; $18 for students and 65+.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow and Sunday at 5 p.m., P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at East Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288; $20. (La Rocco)    MOMIX (Tonight through Sunday) This popular troupe of shape shifters concludes the opening week of its three-week run at the Joyce Theater with ''Passion.'' Next week, an encore of ''Lunar Sea.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $42. (La Rocco)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) No new Diamond Project ballets this week, just repertory programs featuring the latest premieres: Eliot Feld's tonight, Christopher Wheeldon's tomorrow afternoon, Mauro Bigonzetti's tomorrow evening, and Peter Martins's Sunday afternoon. There also is an all-Balanchine, all-Brahms double bill on Tuesday, with ''Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet'' repeated on Wednesday with the Balanchine/Stravinsky pairing of ''Monumentum pro Gesualdo'' and ''Movements for Piano and Orchestra'' and the Bigonzetti. The season runs until June 25. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or nycballet.org; $30 to $86; student rush tickets at $15. (John Rockwell)    * NRITYAGRAM DANCE ENSEMBLE (Tonight and tomorrow) A hit last spring at the Joyce Theater, these leading practitioners of Indian Odissi dance return to the Skirball Center, part of a three-month United States tour that winds up May 26-31 at the Spoleto USA festival in Charleston, S.C. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484 or (212) 279-4200 or skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $38; $15 for students. (Rockwell)    WENDY OSSERMAN DANCE COMPANY (Sunday) Ms. Osserman describes herself as a choreographer who has been confusing the personal with the political and historical for three decades. She'll do it again in her recent ''Imagine/non lethal force.'' At 3 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109 or theatermania.com; pay what you want on Sundays. (Dunning)    * RACHID OURAMDANE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Ouramdane, a French choreographer and dancer of Algerian descent, offers a fascinating, troubling hourlong solo about young men and suicide called ''Les Morts Pudiques'' (''Discreet Deaths'').

(Dunning)    STREB SLAM VI (Tonight through Sunday) Batten down the hatches. Elizabeth Streb's fearless high-fliers are at it again in ''Wild Blue Yonder,'' a new spring program paying tribute to early heroes of aviation, presented informally, with popcorn.

(Dunning)    VCU DANCE: TRAFFIC @ ST. MARKS (Tomorrow) In the latest installment of the DraftWork/Academy Dances series, VCU Dance makes its New York debut with a program featuring the work of current Virginia Commonwealth University students and alumni. At 3 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, Lower East Side, (212) 674-8194; free. (La Rocco)    VIA DANCE COLLABORATIVE (Tonight and tomorrow) This young company of 10 dancers and choreographers, including Lindsay Fisher, Dawn Poirier, Katie Edwards and Adrienne Westwood, has been described by the dance curator Monica Bill Barnes as ''a group of fierce, fearless dancers who arrived in new York and hit the ground running.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444 or viadance.org; $20 at the door. (Dunning)    VISION FESTIVAL: YVES MUSARD (Sunday) Mr. Musard, a dancer and choreographer, will collaborate with Ned Rothenberg, an alto saxophonist. At 1:30 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681 or visionfestival.org; $10; $7 for students and children over 14; free for children under 14.(Dunning)    * CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS (Thursday) Mr. Williams, a dancer and choreographer who has worked with the puppeteer Basil Twist, made the remarkable ''Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins'' last season at P.S. 122. This new program offers more medievally inspired choreography: his ''Portuguese Suite'' and three solos from ''The Golden Legend,'' a male adjunct to the female ''Ursula,'' with John Kelly as one of the performers. (Through May 21.) At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or danspaceproject.org; $15. (Rockwell)    * WORKS & PROCESS AT THE GUGGENHEIM (Sunday and Monday) Get a sneak peek at James Kudelka's ''Cinderella'' before it has its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House. American Ballet Theater performs excerpts from the work, while the artistic director Kevin McKenzie chats with Mr. Kudelka. At 8 p.m., the Peter B. Lewis Theater, Guggenheim Museum, (212) 423-3587; $24; $18 for students, 65+ and members. (La Rocco)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000.(Glueck)    DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'Stories to Tell: Masterworks from the Kelly Collection of American Illustration,' through May 21. During the Golden Age of Illustration -- the 1880's to the 1930's -- images made by painters for magazines and books captivated the collective American psyche. Original works by some of the best of those artists, including J. C. Leyendecker, N. C. Wyeth and Charles Dana Gibson, are included in this extensive and well-selected exhibition. 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Ken Johnson)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck)    * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000.(Holland Cotter)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early 18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (See above.) (Glueck)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)    * The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    * 'Great Pots: The Vessel as Art, 1900 to 2000' This extraordinarily rich and varied lobby show presents 164 works by 143 artists from the Newark Museum's famed ceramics collection. It focuses on utilitarian vessels -- vases, bowls, pots, mugs and platters -- but covers an enormous amount of aesthetic territory, taking in Pueblo Indian, Arts and Crafts, classical Japanese, European Modernist, Pop, funk and much more. The show includes great craftsmen like George Orr, Beatrice Wood, Peter Voulkos and Ron Nagel. The UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through May 19. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    * Josephsohn A powerful exhibition of five crusty, semi-abstract, oversized heads cast in bronze by a Zurich-based sculptor who was born in East Prussia in 1920. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through May 27. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Judy Glantzman Her congested expressionistic paintings composed of scores of little human heads are like visions of hell by the Belgian Symbolist James Ensor. Also on view are scary and funny little doll-like figures made of a material called Super Sculpy. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through May 26. (Johnson)    * Aaron Parazette: 'All On Up' This Houston-based painter creates punchy, colorful, sign-like compositions using big letters as his basic building blocks. The letters spell words like insane, juice and thruster, but they are variously inverted, reversed and mixed up to enhance the exceptionally gratifying graphic impact. Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212) 463-8634, through May 20. (Johnson)    * Rosalind Solomon, 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through June 3. (Johnson)    Peter Vogel: 'Interactive Sonic & Light Sculptures' This German sculptor who was trained as a physicist is well known in Europe for the electronic light and sound works he has been creating since the late 1960's. His neat constructions of wire, transistors, lights and speakers look great, but they are especially interesting for the complex musical sounds they emit in response to the viewer's moving shadow. Bitforms, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 366-6939, through May 20. (Johnson)    Last Chance    Ken Butler: 'Instrumental Desire: Strings Attached' Trained as a classical musician and as a painter, Mr. Butler is a performance artist who produces electronically amplified music on unlikely stringed instruments that he constructs himself out of found objects and parts of real instruments. This jam-packed exhibition presents 79 instruments made from things like a rifle, an old sled, a leaf rake and a metal detector. Sideshow, 319 Bedford Avenue, at South Second Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8180; closes Monday.(Johnson)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes Sunday. ( Kimmelman)    * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,'  David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500; closes Sunday.( Cotter)    * Lisa Ruyter: 'I Am a Camera'  This painter, known for colorful, photo-based, psychedelic cartoons, takes an exciting turn to black, white and many shades of gray in a series of large, psychologically resonant, finely outlined self-portraits. The nearly 16-foot-wide portrait of the artist, doubled in a mirror against an arboreal background, is a knockout. Team, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    Robert Sholties: 'Evolution' A Pennsylvania postal worker with no formal art training, Mr. Sholties paints intensely detailed fantasy landscapes populated by wild and domestic animals and people who are often in South American costumes. Magical, allegorical and apocalyptic events occur, and themes of religion and ecological disaster are addressed in these visionary pictures. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-4819; closes tomorrow.
