Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org.    Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    * 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    Spectacles    'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)    'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'CREATION: A CLOWN SHOW' Lucas Caleb Rooney is a cross between Red Skelton and Will Ferrell in this sweet, funny, poignant, mostly one-man show about the biblical story of earth's first seven days (1:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'HENRIK IBSEN + JON FOSSE: NORWAY MEETS NEW YORK' Ibsen's late-19th-century ''Rosmersholm'' and Fosse's contemporary ''deathvariations'' both deal with suicide, among other life dramas. The Ibsen has problems, but the Fosse is often stunning and fiercely poetic (2:00 and 1:15). At the 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    * 'KIKI AND HERB: ALIVE ON BROADWAY' This transcendental lounge act -- made up of Kiki (Justin Bond), a molting songbird for all seasons, and Herb (Kenny Mellman), her happily suffering shadow and accompanist -- has the heat and dazzle of great balls of fire. Vital, funny and surprisingly affecting (2:00). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'MR. DOOLEY'S AMERICA' Martin J. Dooley, the wisest fictional pub owner in 1890's Chicago, brings his old newspaper columns back to life with funny, surprisingly timely issues-of-the-day commentary in this likable two-man play (1:40). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee)    'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (A. O. Scott)    'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)    'BEERFEST' (R, 110 minutes) In ''Beerfest,'' a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard head for Munich and an underground beer-guzzling contest. Best viewed while sloshed, the movie is idiotic, tasteless and irrepressibly good-natured: in other words, a frat-house classic. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt-putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    'The Celestine Prophecy' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    'CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN' (No rating, 84 minutes) Two old flames meet, years after parting, and have a short fling. An arch, banal conceit, of some interest for Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter's performances and the split-screen gimmick that keeps them apart even in their intimate moments. (Scott)    'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee)    'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee)    * 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)    * 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haut-bourgeois Parisian marriage, around 1912. (Dargis)    * 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)    * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis)    * 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott)    'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)    * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)    'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. While Disney piles on the uplift, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)    * 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. Progressive adults may balk at the film's ultimate capitulation to the power of patronage, but tykes will just be happy that Lassie has come home once more to the multiplex where she belongs. (Catsoulis)    'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)    'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)    * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)    'MATERIAL GIRLS' (PG, 97 minutes) The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story from, alas, Martha Coolidge. (Dargis)    * 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)    * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. Three intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)    'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)    'PRINCESAS' (No rating, 109 minutes, in Spanish) This maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodóvar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa. (Lee)    'Pulse' (PG-13, 87 minutes) Evil technology menaces idiotic teenagers in this cynical remake of a Japanese horror film. (Lee)    'QUEENS' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Spanish) A dithering but generous Spanish farce, ''Queens'' follows the forthcoming nuptials of three gay couples by focusing on their overbearing mothers. While the sons dance, bicker and fret over antiques, the mamas express their discomfort with the wedding plans by seducing inappropriate men. Despite obvious nods to Pedro Almodóvar, ''Queens'' is notable only for its unadulterated worship of middle-aged women. (Catsoulis)    'THE QUIET' (R, 96 minutes) Neither ambitious enough to take seriously nor sleazy enough to enjoy, Jamie Babbit's good-girl, bad-girl face-off flirts with the trappings of exploitation cinema without going all the way. (Dargis)    * 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)    'RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES' (PG, 108 minutes, in Mandarin) Zhang Yimou takes a pause between marital-arts extravaganzas with this simple, affecting melodrama about a mournful Japanese patriarch on an odyssey through rural China. (Lee)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)    'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark 13-letter epithet. (Dargis)    'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott)    '13 Tzameti'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French New Wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)    'TRUST THE MAN' (R, 101 minutes) A strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, from the writer and director Bart Freundlich. With Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Billy Crudup. (Dargis)    * 'ANDY WARHOL: A DOCUMENTARY FILM' (No rating, 4 hours with an intermission) Ric Burns's absorbing four-hour critical biography of this seminal Pop artist is devoted to the proposition that Warhol was the greatest artist of the second half of the 20th century, as Picasso was in the first. It makes a mostly persuasive, highly entertaining case for that claim. (Holden)    * 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)    Film Series    THE BEST OF NEWFEST (Through Sunday) BAMcinématek's selection of 10 films from the 18th annual New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Film Festival, held in June, begins tonight.

Other films in the series will include ''Sansho the Bailiff'' (1954), a tale of an exiled governor and his family, and ''The Story of Last Chrysanthemums'' (1939), Mizoguchi's masterpiece about a Kabuki actor and the woman who gives her all for him. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8112; $10.

The noirish ''Leave Her to Heaven'' (1945), whose supporting actors include Jeanne Crain and Vincent Price, will be shown with ''Written on the Wind'' (1956), for which Dorothy Malone, as a self-destructive rich girl, won the best-supporting-actress Oscar. 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10.

Mr. Doucet learned the scratch and drone of his fiddle style from the masters of Cajun and Creole music, and he's equally at home playing an old-fashioned two-step or rowdy swamp rock. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $25.

(Sisario)    BORIS; PEARLS AND BRASS (Monday and Tuesday) And on a certain beer-buzzed day (whose ordinal number is forgotten), Deep Purple, the James Gang and Black Sabbath created fuzzy, head-nodding biker metal, and it was good. Many begats later, Pearls and Brass, a trio from Nazareth, Pa., is worshiping studiously at their altar, while Boris, a three-piece from Japan, warps and refracts the same influences in ways that can amplify their power or just make them really noisy and repetitious. Monday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; Tuesday at 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door.

(Pareles)    BROOKLYN COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) Though it may be stretching things a bit to call a one-night club gig a festival, this third annual event has a strong lineup of local honky-tonkers, among them Greg Garing, a stalwart of the New York country scene; the Demolition String Band, from Hoboken, N.J., which does a bluegrass version of Madonna's ''Like a Prayer''; and the Defibulators, who also know how to pick with a wink in songs like ''Armageddon Boogie.'' Others on the bill include Uncle Leon and the Alibis, the Wissler Family, Sweet William, Alex Battles's Whisky Rebellion, Kara Suzanne and the Gojo Hearts and the Lonesome Prairie Dogs. Beginning at 4 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, (718) 230-0236, brooklyncountrymusic.com or spsounds.com; $10. (Sisario)    * CAT POWER AND THE MEMPHIS RHYTHM BAND (Sunday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded in Memphis with a group of veteran soul players. The strutting rhythms, tender guitars and happy horns give her an expressive new vocabulary of sorrows, loves and joys; she hasn't sounded so inspired in years. At 6:30 and 10:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)    GEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS (Sunday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $37.50 in advance, $42 at the door. (Pareles)    COMETS ON FIRE (Tonight) Serving as a reminder that psychedelic rock was as much about testosterone-flooded blues jams as about tangerine trees and marmalade skies, Comets on Fire, from Santa Cruz, Calif., reaches back to the loud legacy of Blue Cheer. With Soldiers of Fortune and Blues Control. At 11, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $14.

(Sisario)    DEVOTCHKA (Tonight and tomorrow night) DeVotchKa, from Denver, is the most musically versatile band of the Gypsy-punk trendlet of the last few years. It does its share of wild fiddling and rug-cutting, but also plays moody, carefully textured ballads that can recall the Tindersticks. At midnight, Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $20. (Sisario)    * DR. OCTAGON, MR. LIF, BEANS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Kool Keith was already one of the most eccentric figures in rap when he unveiled his Dr. Octagon project a decade ago. But with one brilliantly bizarre album he instantly trumped all as the most clever and twisted mind in the game, his non sequiturs revealing both raunchiness and a kind of innocence. Kool Keith recently released ''The Return of Dr. Octagon'' (OCD); it's no classic, but a good excuse for him to revisit the character. Also on the bill are two of underground rap's best: Mr. Lif, a politically minded M.C. from Boston, and Beans, formerly of New York's Antipop Consortium. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $22 in advance, $24 at the door.

Also on the bill is Two Gallants. At 4 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $38.50 in advance, $45 at the door.

(Sisario)    * MASTODON (Tonight) Until Mastodon released ''Leviathan'' two years ago, the world lacked an extreme metal album based on Melville's ''Moby-Dick''; thankfully, it's an extraordinary piece of work, dense and exhilarating and fully attentive to every slashing sonic detail, as is the band's new album, ''Blood Mountain'' (Warner Brothers), to be released on Tuesday. With Converge, from Salem, Mass., and the Bronx, from Los Angeles. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $17.

(Sisario)    RADIO BIRDMAN (Tonight) In the mid-70's, Radio Birdman kick-started the Australian punk scene with a brawny, speedy style drawn from Detroit groups like the MC5 and the Stooges. (Not a coincidence: one of Radio Birdman's guitarists, Deniz Tek, grew up in Ann Arbor, Mich.) Thirty years after its first record, the band makes its New York debut. With the Rogers Sisters and Easy Action. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25.

(Sisario)    SHAKIRA, WYCLEF JEAN (Tonight) Their flirty duet ''Hips Don't Lie'' was one of the biggest hits of the summer, perhaps because its odd stabs at political commentary (''Why the C.I.A. wanna watch us?/ Colombians and Haitians/ I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction,'' Mr. Jean raps) are no match for its old-fashioned, steamy body language (''I'm on tonight/ My hips don't lie/ And I am starting to feel you, boy,'' Shakira replies). At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $19.50 to $129.50.

WARD, OAKLEY HALL (Thursday) On his mesmerizing new album, ''Post-War'' (Merge), M. Ward mingles political indignation, however oblique (''He was a good man and now he's gone,'' goes ''Requiem,'' about a fallen soldier), with a languid, surrealistic melancholy.

(Pareles)    WORLD PARTY (Tomorrow) For a few albums as World Party in the 1980's and 90's, Karl Wallinger borrowed worshipfully and unapologetically from the holy texts of 60's rock -- Beatles, Stones, Dylan, Beach Boys -- prefiguring the now-omnipresent retro-rock trend. He recently returned after a long recovery from a debilitating aneurysm, and has rejiggered his last album, ''Dumbing Up'' (Seaview), for rerelease. With Gina Villalobos.

At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard , 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)    WILLIAMSBURG JAZZ FESTIVAL (Sunday through Thursday) This grass-roots affair, which briefly floods a small swatch of Brooklyn with modern jazz, kicks off late Sunday night with a no-cover jam session (at Rose, 345 Grand Street, between Havemeyer and Marcy Streets), and continues through next week. One of its highlights is a program featuring bands led by the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake and the bassist Chris Tarry, among others (Thursday at Galapagos, 70 North Sixth Street). (Through Sept. 16.) Times and locations vary; for a full schedule, visit fullcircledrumming.com/wjazzfestival. (Chinen)    MIGUEL ZENÓN AND THE RHYTHM COLLECTIVE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Zenón, a serious-minded young alto saxophonist from Puerto Rico, leads an aptly named ensemble of musicians with a similar cultural heritage: Aldemar Valentin on electric bass, Reynaldo deJesus on hand percussion and Tony Escapa on drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $12. (Chinen)     * JOHN ZORN AND THE BOOK OF ANGELS (Sunday) The Oy!Hoo Festival -- also known as the New York Jewish Music and Heritage Festival -- kicks off with this kaleidoscopic tour through ''The Book of Angels,'' a body of 300 works composed by John Zorn during an apparently feverish three-month span. Mr. Zorn will play alto saxophone in Masada, his original avant-garde klezmer quartet, and with Electric Masada, his eight-piece improvising chamber group. And he will conduct both the Masada String Trio and the Kol Nidre String Orchestra, an ensemble named after the sacred Jewish prayer. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, oyhoo.com; $25 to $118. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    * 'LA BOHÈME' AND 'CARMEN' (Tonight through Sunday) If promoters and presenters of classical music need proof that the steep cost of tickets discourages people, especially younger ones, from attending, they should stop by Lincoln Center for the New York City Opera's ''Opera-for-All'' programs. This weekend the series, introduced at the beginning of last season, offers the company's productions of Puccini's ''Bohème'' and Bizet's ''Carmen'' priced at $25 a seat, for any seat in the house. Tickets are sold on a first-come-first-served basis. Last year, the company reports, 71 percent of the audiences for ''Opera-for-All'' events had never been to the City Opera before. The productions tend to feature young, eager and attractive singers in stagings that emphasize opera as a vivid form of theater. Rinat Shaham sings the title role in ''Carmen'' (tomorrow night at 8); James Robinson's updated production of ''La Bohème'' features Shu-Ying Li as Mimi and James Valenti in his company debut as Rodolfo (tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m.). New York State Theater, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com. (Anthony Tommasini)    * 'SEMELE' (Wednesday) In the last 15 years the New York City Opera has become a haven for Handel. This season the company presents the New York stage premiere of ''Semele,'' a work the composer conceived and presented as a dramatic oratorio, though in the 20th century it was effectively staged. The City Opera's new production is by the director Stephen Lawless. The brilliant coloratura soprano Elizabeth Futral sings the title role. The charismatic mezzo-soprano Vivica Genaux, who has performed at the Metropolitan Opera and other major international companies, sings Juno. The impressive cast also includes Constance Hauman and Sanford Sylvan. Anthony Walker conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) The weekend on Brooklyn's favorite floating concert hall begins with the second of two performances by the fine pianists Ursula Oppens and Jerome Lowenthal in an entertaining program of Mozart and variations on Wagner; it continues with a performance by the Shanghai String Quartet: works by Turina and Zhou Long, and string quartets by Barber and Ravel. On Thursday the pianist Maya Hartman gives a solo recital, playing Berger and Griffes, Mozart and Schumann. There is also a special 9/11 memorial concert on Monday (see box). Tonight, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday nights at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $30 for 65+; $20 for students; Monday's concert is free. (Anne Midgette)    ANDREA BOCELLI (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Bocelli occupies a small, glamorous and highly profitable space between grand opera and public entertainment. His personality and slight tenor voice have won him a big following, as witnessed by four sold-out concerts at Avery Fisher Hall, the last two of which are tonight and tomorrow night. Asher Fisch conducts the New York Philharmonic in this program of operatic favorites. At 8, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org. (Bernard Holland)    CONCERTANTE  (Sunday) This young chamber group plays Boccherini's G minor String Quintet and Lowell Lieberman's ''One Plus Five.'' Later Anton Nel is the pianist in Elgar's estimable A minor Quintet. At 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, ekcc.org; $20. (Holland)    ETHEL (Tuesday) Funky and genre-defying, Ethel is the rock band of string quartets -- the term ''classical'' hardly applies to its brand of eclectic, hip music. The ensemble is celebrating the release of its second CD, ''Light'' (Canteloupe Records), with a concert featuring a mix of so-called EthelFaves (top requests from previous concerts) and new music; the CD includes compositions by Don Byron, Pamela Z, Mary Ellen Childs, Marcelo Zarvos, you name it. Audiences may not know exactly what hit them, but they usually like it. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Midgette)    HERMINE HASELBÖCK (Tonight) This young Austrian singer and the pianist Istvan Bonyhadi bring late Romantic and early 20th-century Vienna to the Austrian Cultural Forum's tiny performing space. Songs are by Berg, Schoenberg, Franz Schreker and Zemlinsky. At 8, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, Ext. 222, acfny.org; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)    JENNY LIN (Tuesday) A smart musician, in the best sense of both words, Ms. Lin is forging a fine career exactly on her own terms, which include a strong commitment to contemporary and less-known music. Her canny program for the Austrian Cultural Forum's ''Mostly Modern'' festival balances Austrian and American composers, modern and contemporary: two 20th-century classics, Barber and Berg; two strong women, Ruth Crawford Seeger and Olga Neuwirth; and two young contemporary composers, Randy Nordschow and Johannes Maria Staud. At 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, Ext. 222, acfny.org; free, but tickets are required. (Midgette)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) After its preseason programs with the crossover sensation Andrea Bocelli, the Philharmonic under its music director Lorin Maazel opens its formal season on Wednesday. True to tradition, this gala offers familiar fare, Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture and ''Eroica'' Symphony. Mozart's joyous Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in E flat, which does not turn up as often as it might, is the one novelty. The soloists in the concerto will be Emanuel Ax and Yefim Bronfman, who besides being excellent pianists, are also friends and New York neighbors. The music director, Lorin Maazel, conducts. Starting on Thursday night in the first subscription series program of the season, Mr. Maazel and his players offer more intriguing fare, with the American premiere of Hans Werner Henze's ''Sebastian im Traum''; Ravel's sultry ''Rapsodie Espagnole''; Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite; and Bruch's most popular work, the Violin Concerto in G minor, with Itzhak Perlman as soloist. (There are three more performances of Thursday's program through Sept. 19.) At 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $85 tickets remaining on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Tommasini)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    THE BROOKLYN ADULT RECORDER CHOIR (Thursday) The name of this group turns out to be literal description rather than whimsy: a self-described ''ad-hoc group'' of some 60 performers trying to recapture the joys of those painful recorder lessons at school during ''In the Closet, Again, Again.'' The choreographer Beth Gill and the composer Chris Peck thought this up. From 7 to 10 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $15, or pay what you will for Queens residents.(Roslyn Sulcas)    * DANCENOW/NYC (Tonight though Sunday and Thursday) The 12th season of this varied showcase, at Dance Theater Workshop through tomorrow and at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater from Thursday through next Saturday. Each program offers a plethora of dancers, most of them young and upwardly mobile. The complete schedule is at dancenownyc.org. Tonight at 7:30 ($20); tomorrow at 2 ($15), 5 (free), and 7:30 p.m. ($20), Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org.

(John Rockwell)    DANSCORES BY OFELIA LORET DE MOLA  (Thursday) Although ''Aktun Spukil'' sounds like one of the crew on the Starship Enterprise, it is, according to Mexican lore, the name of a group of caves in which the Maya took shelter during battles. The work by the choreographer Ofelia Loret de Mola is the only dance offering in the Celebrate Mexico Now festival. . At 8 p.m. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 431-9233; $15, students $12. (Sulcas)    * EVENING STARS (Tonight and Sunday) The big late-summer free dance sampler in New York, presented by the River to River Festival with the Joyce Theater and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, offers a heavy-hitting triple bill tonight of Trisha Brown, Ashleigh Leite and Stephen Petronio, with a salsa chaser on Sunday: an amateur contest at 4 p.m. followed by a professional show at 7:30 that includes the contest winner. Battery Park, rivertoriver.com.(Rockwell)    NOÉMI LAFRANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) Apparently Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for one thousand bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309 or sensproduction.org; $20 and $30. (Sulcas)    LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE (Today through Thursday) Dance and performance art by 16 choreographers and companies will be presented this week in theaters in and around Center City Philadelphia, among them Kate Watson-Wallace; the Jo Stromgren Kompani; BalletX in dances by Jorma Elo and Matthew Neenan; Reggie Wilson; and Jeb Kreager. For information about the festival, which runs through Sept. 16: (215) 413-1318 or livearts-fringe.org; $10, $15 and $20, depending on the event, with some shows free.

(Through Sept. 16.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12. (Dunning)    New Ballet Choreographers (Wednesday) Ashley Bouder, Maria Kowrowski and Wendy Whelan are among the wonderful group of dancers from the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater Studio Company who will dance in this enticing program of new ballets to live music by the Masada String Trio. The choreographers are the City Ballet soloists Edwaard Liang and Tom Gold, and the former Ballet Theater dancer Brian Reeder. Mr. Gold is the wild card here -- the other two have budding reputations as promising ballet choreographers -- but he is in very good company. At 7 p.m., Miller Theater at Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35, Columbia students $7, non-Columbia students and Guggenheim Museum members, $21.

The tribute will also raise money for a scholarship fund for young dancers. From 5 to 8 p.m., Philadelphia Art Alliance, 251 South 18th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 551-7000 ext. 1209 or www.paballet.org; $80 and $150. (Dunning)    ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Thursday) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live, through Sept. 16 and from Sept. 21 to 23. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8 p.m., Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561 or rindfleischdance.com; $15. (Dunning)    TEA Dance Company (Thursday) Sahar Javedani and Ella Ben-Aharon, the troupe's resident choreographers, will present their new ''Garden,'' which probes the notion of the pre-apple Eden as a metaphor for the personal acquisition of knowledge.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)    BARD GRADUATE CENTER: ' LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet, but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper-alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. (The serpents are handles.) The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith)    Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,'  through March. Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100. (Holland Cotter)    * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Cotter)    Guild Hall Museum: 'Elizabeth Peyton,'  through Oct. 22. Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Queen Elizabeth are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. A kind of erotic yearning animates how Ms. Peyton sees her subjects and how she makes her pictures. To paint, her works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806. (Ken Johnson)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    Katonah Museum of Art: 'Andromeda Hotel, the Art of Joseph Cornell,'  through Sept. 17. Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. In this show the white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled ''Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni'' (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of the artist's adoration. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, ''Hotel de l'Étoile'' (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-9555, katonahmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)    Morgan Library & Museum: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, through Oct. 1. On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Smith)    * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)    NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)    * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)    Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson RiverSchool Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)    Galleries: Uptown    * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    * GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    HANS RICHTER (1888-1976), DADA; ART AND ANTI-ART This daunting yet partial survey is clogged with late paintings and reliefs that are for the most part elegant pastiches of Constructivism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. But it should be seen for the four short films from the 1920's, in which Richter's formalist and Dada sides balance beautifully, with elegantly Surrealist results. This is especially the case in the luminous ''Ghosts Before Breakfast,'' from 1927, which explores most of film's structural possibilities and segues briskly between abstraction and Hollywood narrative, while three skittering bowler hats provide continuity. Maya Stendhal Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, mayastendhalgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    Other Galleries    'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org through Oct. 16. (Johnson)    Last Chance    * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings' This exhibition gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday.(Cotter)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan'  Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA' This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)    * JAMES J. WILLIAMS III: 'BY REQUEST, MY EPITAPH' Despite debts to artists like Jack Pierson, Karen Kilimnik, Richard Prince and Nan Goldin, this Haversham-ish environment and solo debut exude a promising fusion of modesty and narcissism. Its deep teal walls display scores of Polaroids, drawings, collages, notebooks and thrift-shop-worthy paintings, along with many of the artist's well-worn belongings. An illusion of stylish, if impoverished, full disclosure results. Self-conscious bohemianism teeters between nostalgia and irony, and art emerges as an incessant if nonchalant activity at the center of an eked-out existence.

A desperate man turns to the religious right for comfort in this exploration of extremism (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.    'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH' Previews start today. Opens Sept. 21. Bruce Norris's drama about a dysfunctional family arrives in New York after a successful run at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater. Jayne Houdyshell and Reg Rogers star (2:15).

Keen Company's adaptation of Thornton Wilder's novel is about a teacher who quits his job and heads out for adventure -- until his car breaks down in Newport (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'KIKI AND HERB: ALIVE ON BROADWAY' This transcendental lounge act -- made up of Kiki (Justin Bond), a molting songbird for all seasons, and Herb (Kenny Mellman), her happily suffering shadow and accompanist -- has the heat and dazzle of great balls of fire. Vital, funny and surprisingly affecting (2:00). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'CREATION: A CLOWN SHOW' Lucas Caleb Rooney is a cross between Red Skelton and Will Ferrell in this sweet, funny, poignant mostly one-man show about the biblical story of earth's first seven days (1:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'MR. DOOLEY'S AMERICA' Martin J. Dooley, the wisest fictional pub owner in 1890's Chicago, brings his old newspaper columns back to life with funny, surprisingly timely issues-of-the-day commentary in this likable two-man play (1:40). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    * 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    Spectacles    'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims at a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)    'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'EVERYTHINGS TURNING INTO BEAUTIFUL' Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's thrill-free demi-musical about a pair of commitment-wary songwriters (Daphne Rubin-Vega and Malik Yoba) is clearly intended to progress from wintry loneliness to heated confrontation and eroticism. But it remains stolidly at room temperature. Directed by Carl Forsman, with songs by Jimmie James (1:50). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'INDIAN BLOOD' As slight as it is sweet, A. R. Gurney's latest is like a snow globe for the stage, in this case a memento of wintry Buffalo in the mid-1940's. Written with delicacy and old-school craftsmanship, the work is a modest memory play endowed with a measure of emotional heft by its unchallenged but unusually strong cast, which includes John McMartin and Rebecca Luker (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' If you ever wanted to watch one willowy human being lift a 12-ton play onto her shoulders and hold it there for hours, even as her muscles buckle, join the line to see Meryl Streep burning energy like a supernova in this otherwise less-than-stunning production. Directed by George C. Wolfe, from a new translation by Tony Kushner (2:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park, (212) 539-8750; free; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director, John Doyle, aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles.

'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee)    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott)    'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE BEALES OF GREY GARDENS' (No rating, 90 minutes) The Maysles brothers dig into their archives for this collection of outtakes from ''Grey Gardens,'' their 1975 cinema vérité classic about the most fascinating cat ladies in the Hamptons. Essential viewing for drag queens. ( Lee)    'BEERFEST' (R, 110 minutes) In ''Beerfest,'' a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard head for Munich and an underground beer-guzzling contest. Best viewed while sloshed, the movie is idiotic, tasteless and irrepressibly good-natured -- in other words, a frat-house classic. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    * 'THE BRIDESMAID' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) The great Claude Chabrol again takes up a sharp instrument and directs it at one of his favorite targets, the family. Yet while his aim remains true, his touch has become gentler, more forgiving. (Dargis)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt- putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    'THE CELESTINE PROPHECY' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis)    * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)    'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    'CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN' (No rating, 84 minutes) Two old flames meet, years after parting, and have a short fling. An arch, banal conceit, of some interest for Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter's performances and the split-screen gimmick that keeps them apart even in their intimate moments. (Scott)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    * 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)    'FRATRICIDE' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Kurdish, German and Turkish) The familiar story of the innocent soul who travels from the country to the big, bad city receives a thorough workout from the Turkish-born German-transplant Yilmaz Arslan. If the human disembowelment via a pit bull doesn't bum you out, the child rape should do the trick. (Dargis)    * 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haut-bourgeois Parisian marriage, around 1912. (Dargis)    * 'HALF NELSON' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)    * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis)    * 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott)    'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)    * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)    'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. While Disney piles on the uplift, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)    'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)    'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)     * 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)    'LOL' (No rating, 81 minutes) The inability to connect in a hyper-wired world is old news given fresh voice in this tragicomic indie about the way we live -- or rather, about the way white, urban, heterosexual circuit boys are failing to live. (Lee)    'MATERIAL GIRLS' (PG, 97 minutes) The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story from, alas, Martha Coolidge. (Dargis)    * 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)    * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)    'MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Arabic, English and Kurdish) Filmed in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2005, ''My Country, My Country'' views the prelude to the January elections primarily through the eyes of Dr. Riyadh, a Sunni candidate and physician who runs a free clinic in Baghdad. Without comment but with unusual sensitivity, the director, Laura Poitras, exposes the emotional toll of occupation on Iraqis and United States soldiers alike, leaving us feeling that this particular mission is far from accomplished. (Catsoulis)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'PRINCESAS' (No rating, 109 minutes, in Spanish) This maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodóvar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa. (Lee)    'PULSE' (PG-13, 87 minutes) Evil technology menaces idiotic teenagers in this cynical remake of a Japanese horror film. (Lee)    'QUEENS' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Spanish) A dithering but generous Spanish farce, ''Queens'' follows the forthcoming nuptials of three gay couples by focusing on their overbearing mothers. While the sons dance, bicker and fret over antiques, the mamas express their discomfort with the wedding plans by seducing inappropriate men. Despite obvious nods to Pedro Almodóvar, ''Queens'' is notable only for its unadulterated worship of middle-aged women. (Catsoulis)    'THE QUIET' (R, 96 minutes) Neither ambitious enough to take seriously nor sleazy enough to enjoy, Jamie Babbit's good-girl, bad-girl face-off flirts with the trappings of exploitation cinema without going all the way. (Dargis)    * 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    * 'SCOOP' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)    'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark 13-letter epithet. (Dargis)    'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott)    '10TH AND WOLF' (R, 110 minutes) A grisly gangster movie with moral pretensions, ''10th and Wolf'' never transcends mobster clichés recycled from ''The Godfather,'' ''Donnie Brasco'' and ''GoodFellas.'' (Holden)    '13 TZAMETI'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)    'TRUST THE MAN' (R, 101 minutes) A strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, from the writer and director Bart Freundlich. With Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Billy Crudup. (Dargis)    * 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)    Film Series    ANOTHER WAVE: GLOBAL QUEER CINEMA (Through Sept. 16) After an August break, the Museum of Modern Art's festival of gay films and shorts from more than two dozen countries is back. This weekend's features include ''I Like You, I Like You Very Much'' (1994), from Japan, a portrait of small-town gay life; ''Johanna d'Arc of Mongolia'' (1989), from Germany, described as a lesbian ''Lawrence of Arabia''; and ''Madama Satã'' (2002), from Brazil, starring Lázaro Ramos as Francisco dos Santos, a transvestite singer in 1930's Rio de Janeiro. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Anita Gates)    THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS (Through Sept. 25) Film Forum's eight-film, eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) continues on Monday night with ''College'' (1927), about a bookish young man who takes up sports to impress his girlfriend. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)    KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''The Hidden Fortress'' (1958), an action-adventure about a general (Toshiro Mifune, of course) and a princess in disguise (Misa Uehara) trying to transport gold across enemy lines. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates)    THE HUSTON FAMILY: 75 YEARS ON FILM (Through Sept. 22) The Museum of Modern Art's 40-film tribute to the Hustons and their intertwined careers continues with nine films this weekend. They include ''Dodsworth'' (1936), starring Walter as a powerful man in love with an expatriate; ''Chinatown'' (1974), with John as a powerful man in love with his daughters; and ''Mr. North'' (1988), Thornton Wilder's comedy of 1920's manners, starring Anjelica and directed by Danny. Their father, John, was co-writer. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters; $10. (Gates)    MARY PICKFORD RESTORED (Through Sept. 3) The Museum of the Moving Image's tribute to Hollywood's first real movie star concludes this weekend with restored 35-millimeter prints of two of her silent films. ''Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall'' (1924) is a melodrama about a young 16th-century Englishwoman who angers the queen. ''Sparrows'' (1926), considered Pickford's darkest film, is about a kidnapping at a Dickensian ''baby farm.'' 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    NEW YORK KOREAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) This 10-day festival of recent Korean box office hits concludes this weekend with a dozen films, some at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and some at Anthology Film Archives. They include ''Rules of Dating'' (2005), a comedy about the romance between a man-about-town and an innocent schoolteacher; ''Murder Take One'' (2005), a twisty homicide thriller; and ''The Aggressives!'' (2004), about tough skateboarders. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, (718) 636-4100; Anthology, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village; $10. (Gates)    Pop  Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ALBUM, SWEET ELECTRA (Tonight) Like Mexico City's celebrated Café Tacuba, Album, from Monterrey, plays an ingenious and invigorating kind of polyglot art-pop that draws from alternative and psychedelic rock as well as from oompah Mexican music. The band makes its New York debut tonight with Sweet Electra, an electronic act from Guadalajara. At 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Ben Sisario)    * MARIAH CAREY (Sunday) Before there was ''Idol'' there was Mariah, who made octave-hopping melisma a sport and never met a song she couldn't ride to No. 1. Young singers afraid of being a flash in the pan could learn a lot from Ms. Carey's recent comeback, which relied on fresh hip-hop producers and songwriters. With Sean Paul. At 7 p.m. Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $29.50 to $158.50. (Sisario)    CARNIVORE (Wednesday) For fans of obscure New York metal only: before he founded Type O Negative, Peter Steele led Carnivore, one of the most aggressive and, perhaps not coincidentally, offensive bands of the mid-1980's thrash scene. (Typical song title: ''Jesus Hitler.'') The new version of the band does not include any original members besides Mr. Steele. With Annunaki and Eyes of the Dead. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $26 in advance, $29 at the door. (Sisario)    CLIENTELE (Tuesday) This London group is dedicated to pop understatement. It plays introspective, quietly observant mid-60's-style songs that sound as if a stiff breeze or an unkind word could dispel them. With Great Lakes. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    BOB DYLAN (Tonight) It might not make sense at first glance that Bob Dylan is playing at minor-league baseball stadiums this summer, but his devotion is on record: this is the third year he has done the tour, and a baseball-themed episode of his XM Satellite Radio show -- in which the singer of ''Masters of War'' and ''Like a Rolling Stone'' does an a cappella ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' -- has been added to the archive of the National Baseball Hall of Fame Library. With Jimmie Vaughan, Junior Brown, Elana James and the Continental Two. At 6:30, Dutchess County Stadium, Wappingers Falls, N.Y., (845) 838-0094 or (845) 454-3388, concertstonight.com; $49.50; one child under 12 will be admitted free with each ticket holder. (Sisario)    FAMILY VALUES TOUR (Today and tomorrow) Korn resurrects its tantrum-metal package tour after a four-year absence, with the Deftones, Flyleaf, Stone Sour and the Japanese group Dir En Grey. Today at 2 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; tomorrow at 2 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $9.99 to $59.50. (Sisario)    FRENCH KICKS, SOUND TEAM (Wednesday) The new wave gets a twisted revival in the songs of the French Kicks. Bouncing along on keyboards one moment, facing guitar barbs the next, the songs are as unstable as the romances they sketch. Sound Team, from Austin, Tex., constructs dense and psychologically rich songs in which elements of white soul hint at a spiritual nourishment denied by the anxious guitars and brooding vocals. With the Subjects. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)    GORILLA BISCUITS (Tomorrow and Sunday) The last weeks of CBGB are shaping up as a reunion of the mid-80's class of Hardcore High. This highlight this weekend is Gorilla Biscuits, who were emo before emo was emo: loudly, tunefully and sweatily struggling to keep a positive attitude. Tomorrow at 5:45 p.m., with Murphy's Law, Leeway, Comeback Kid and Sick of Talk, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; Sunday at 3 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com. Both sold out. (Sisario)    JAPANESE NEW MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) Somebody should have thought of this a long time ago. Three mainstays of the Japanese avant-rock scene are touring as a complete ''festival'' by arranging themselves in eight different permutations of solos, duos and trios. Yoshida Tatsuya, best known as the drummer of the long-running stop-start band the Ruins; Kawabata Makoto, a guitarist who is the main force behind the psychedelic-noise group Acid Mothers Temple; and the bassist Tsuyama Atsushi will be playing in various combinations, calling themselves Acid Mothers Temple SWR, Ruins Alone, Akaten, Zoffy, Zubi Zuva X, Seikazoku, Shrinp Wark and RonRuins. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; Sunday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario)    MOSQUITOS (Wednesday) Life is but an indie-pop bossa nova dream with the Mosquitos, a New York-Brazil love story now on its third album of breezy melody and twinkling electronics. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario)    NINA NASTASIA (Wednesday) In her clear voice, Nina Nastasia offers visions of desolation and unflinching love -- ''dirty hands and dirty feet and all'' -- with melodies that can hint at the symmetries of Appalachian music and a homespun backup from instruments like accordion and banjo. With Jeffrey Lewis. At 10 p.m., Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Pareles)    'NUBLU: BROOKLYN' (Sunday) Nublu, an Avenue C bar owned by a Turkish saxophonist and home to a variety of Brazilian bands, is a classic New York multicultural incubator. On Sunday six of its signature acts step outside its warmth for a daylong gig beside the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. Forró in the Dark is one of the best and lowest-tech dance bands in the city, playing forró, a humble and sexy two-beat style made with accordion, hand-held percussion and, since this is New York, whiffs of distorted electric guitar. Love Trio features members of Brazilian Girls, a non-Brazilian band that is one of the club's success stories. Kudu plays jazz-flavored electronic dance music, with slithery vocals by Sylvia Gordon. Also on the bill are Karina Zeviani, a sultry singer for Thievery Corporation and other electronic groups; I Led 3 Lives; and the Nublu Orchestra, led by Butch Morris. From 2 to 9 p.m., 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, ticketweb.com or nublu.net; $10 tickets available only in advance. (Sisario)    ONE RING ZERO (Thursday) This Brooklyn band has set words by authors like Jonathan Lethem, Margaret Atwood and Rick Moody to kitchen-sink songs with toy piano and theremin. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario)    RATATAT (Tuesday) The two guitarists who make up Ratatat have one simple but sometimes charming idea. They plug away at 70's-inspired riffs, creating atmospheric tracks that split the difference between minimalist post-rock and maximalist hard rock. With Envelopes and Panther. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Kelefa Sanneh)    SHAKIRA, WYCLEF JEAN (Thursday) Their flirty duet ''Hips Don't Lie'' was one of the biggest hits of the summer, perhaps because its odd stabs at political commentary (''Why the C.I.A. wanna watch us?/ Colombians and Haitians/ I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction,'' Mr. Jean raps) are no match for its old-fashioned, steamy body language (''I'm on tonight/ My hips don't lie/ And I am starting to feel you, boy,'' Shakira replies). At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; sold out. (Sisario)    * SHELLAC (Tomorrow) A great advantage of being in a so-called supergroup is that you really don't have to play very often to maintain your reputation. Steve Albini, Todd Trainer and Bob Weston keep very busy running recording sessions and playing in other bands, but every few years they gather to play propulsive, gourmet post-rock as Shellac. A new album is said to be in the works, though with these guys' schedules it could take months, if not years. Also on the bill is Uzeda, a quartet from Sicily with an uncanny grasp of the sound of Chicago avant-rock circa 1995. At 7 p.m., Europa Night Club, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, northsix.com; sold out. (Sisario)    TEMPORARY RESIDENCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Temporary Residence, an independent label in New York, celebrates its 10th anniversary with three nights devoted to its signature sound, a warbling guitar pulse that slowly builds to heights of tragic, cinematic grandeur. The best lineup is tomorrow, with Explosions in the Sky, the label's flagship, from Austin, Tex., and Eluvium, a one-man band that recreates the idyll of floating on clouds with layers of keyboards. Mono, the Japanese band that headlines on Sunday, finds greater turbulence. Envy, tonight, another Japanese group, uses similarly melancholy washes of guitar as a backdrop for guttural shrieks; also tonight is Sleeping People, an instrumental group from San Diego that borrows from the nervous antifunk of 90's groups like Unwound, and Cex, a k a Rjyan Kidwell, a techno wise guy with a laptop. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $16 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario)    TO LIVE AND SHAVE IN L.A. (Monday and Wednesday) The line between harsh metal-on-metal noise and abstract musique concrète is deliberately blurred in the music of this long-running collective led by Tom Smith, which on this tour also includes the metal provocateur Andrew W. K., Mark Morgan of the band Sightings, and Don Fleming. Monday at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; Thursday at 8 p.m., Syrup Room, 100 Ingraham Street, at Porter Avenue, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)    VENOM (Tuesday) In the early 80's, this British band coined the term black metal; it has since been appropriated for a kind of operatic Scandinavian vaudeville, but for Venom it referred to a plodding, mirthless satanism. Riding the wave of ironic affection for all 80's metal, the band is on an unexpected reunion tour. With Goatwhore and Early Man. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25 in advance, $28 at the door.

Their mode of expression is ruggedly free-form, but with a high degree of collective sensitivity. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    PATRICIA BARBER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Barber's verbosity and coolly arch intellectualism are uncommon traits for a jazz singer-songwriter. She's also a good pianist, as she demonstrates in her working band, which features the often impressive guitarist Neal Alger. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30 cover, tonight and tomorrow, $25 Sunday. (Chinen)    DAVID BINNEY'S BALANCE (Tuesday) The alto saxophonist David Binney pursues an avant-gardism that embraces harmony, melody and rhythm, along with amplification; he receives sinuous support from the keyboardist Craig Taborn, the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Dan Weiss.

(Chinen)    BROOKLYN QAWWALI PARTY (Tomorrow) The Sufi devotional music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan provides a repertory mandate for this sprawling ensemble. Faithful to its source mainly in terms of exuberance, the group creates a roiling polyphony of percussion, saxophones and brass, bass, harmonium and guitar. At 9 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8.

At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $12, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) ''In Flux'' (Savoy), Mr. Coltrane's most recent album, marked a milestone: his tenor and soprano saxophone playing never sounded more confident, and his compositions had a sleek modernistic hue. He fronts the same stellar band here as on the album: the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer E. J. Strickland. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12.

(Chinen)    CHARLIE HUNTER TRIO (Thursday) Charlie Hunter is a guitarist with a natural affinity for groove, as he has demonstrated with a handful of sturdy bands over the past decade or so. Here he introduces a new one, with Erik Deutsch on keyboards and Simon Lott on drums; they're celebrating the release of a new album, ''Copperopolis'' (Ropeadope). Through Sept. 10 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)    JAVON JACKSON QUARTET (Tonight) The tenor saxophonist Javon Jackson continues a soulful streak with his new album, ''Now,'' which Palmetto Records is releasing this month.

(Chinen)    DONNY McCASLIN GROUP (Sunday) On ''Soar'' (Sunnyside), his most recent album, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin applies his extroverted style to a Latin American-inspired contemporary fusion; he'll do much the same in this show, benefiting greatly from the contributions of the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Hans Glawischnig and the drummer Antonio Sanchez. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    * PAUL MOTIAN, JOE LOVANO, BILL FRISELL (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Motian, a drummer and composer, sets a tone for this blue-chip trio that's shadowy, slippery and as open-ended as a koan; his longtime partners are Joe Lovano, on tenor and soprano saxophones, and Bill Frisell, on guitar. There's no better place to see them than at the Village Vanguard. Through Sept. 17 at 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    NYNDK JAZZ COLLECTIVE (Tuesday) The New York-based trombonist Chris Washburne, the Norwegian saxophonist Ole Mathisen and the Danish pianist Soren Moller formed this pointedly cosmopolitan post-bop collective several years ago; its ranks at this performance include a drummer, Scott Neumann. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $7, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO (Wednesday) Jean-Michel Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce no matter how dark or furious the extemporization. He's at his best in the company of assertive partners like the electric bassist Richard Bona and the drummer Ari Hoenig, who will join him. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    * JENNY SCHEINMAN (Monday and Tuesday) As a violist and violinist, Ms. Scheinman often goes for rustic charm, but she never ceases to be an exploratory improviser. She convenes an all-star sextet on Monday, with Ron Miles on trumpet, Don Byron on clarinet, Larry Grenadier on bass, Kenny Wollesen on drums and a pair of playfully pseudonymous associates: ''JaMo'' on piano and ''Moe Hawk'' on guitar. On Tuesday she takes her customary stand in Park Slope, with a smaller group. On Monday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, $15 in advance, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    JOHN SCOFIELD REAL JAZZ TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) The guitarist John Scofield has extensive history with the bassist Steve Swallow and the drummer Bill Stewart, and they recently made a superb album at the Blue Note, ''EnRoute'' (Verve). One suspects that the name being applied to the trio here wasn't Mr. Scofield's idea -- would he describe his funkier projects as ''fake jazz''? -- but in any case, their music will be jazz, and powerfully real. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    MATTHEW SHIPP TRIO (Monday) Matthew Shipp's pianism is often prickly but rarely off-putting, because even his free improvisations tend to follow a faintly linear path. At this show he has strongly intuitive partners in Joe Morris, on bass, and Whit Dickey, on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; cover, $15 at tables, $10 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    JEFF (TAIN) WATTS QUARTET (Thursday) Jeff (Tain) Watts, one of the most dazzlingly propulsive drummers to emerge in the last quarter-century, leads a dynamic band: Marcus Strickland, a smart young tenor saxophonist; Lawrence Fields, a pianist; and the bassist Eric Revis, Mr. Watts's rhythm section partner in the Branford Marsalis Quartet. At 10:30 p.m., Metropolitan Room at Gotham, 34 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; cover, $25, plus a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    DENNY ZEITLIN TRIO (Tonight through Sunday) Denny Zeitlin has an appealing mainstream piano style, influenced by but not beholden to Bill Evans. He has veteran rhythm section partners in Buster Williams, on bass, and Billy Hart, on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with an midnight set tonight and tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    Classical  Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight) Long respected but not quite in the realm reserved for a few exalted singers, the reliable and sometimes radiant soprano Hei-Kyung Hong is performing as Verdi's Violetta on or near the baseball diamonds of the city's parks. The last ''Traviata'' of the Metropolitan Opera's summer, in which she appears with Wookyung Kim as Alfredo and Charles Taylor as Germont, takes place tonight in New Jersey under the baton of Derrick Inouye. At 8, Brookdale Park, Bloomfield/Montclair, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; free. (Anne Midgette)    'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow) Mark Delavan is a slightly controversial figure in the opera world: some applaud his powerful voice, others find that his bark overpowers his bite. What's not in dispute is that he's a strong and committed singer. The Met has handed him a plum role in this summer's Met in the Parks season -- Verdi's familiar jester, a part not often sung with the nuance and depth it demands. Tomorrow night, in the final concert of the summer season, he appears with Norah Amsellem as Gilda, Nancy Fabiola Herrera as Maddalena, Raymond Aceto as Sparafucile, and José Luis Duval as the Duke of Mantua, led by the knowledgeable veteran Joseph Colaneri. At 8, Buccleuch Park, New Brunswick, N.J., (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; free. (Midgette)    OPERA FOR ALL (Thursday) It's the money, stupid. As opera companies around the country wonder how to attract new audiences, New York City Opera offers a reminder that it's a no-brainer: slash ticket prices. For the second year in a row, the company is opening its season with a mini-festival in which all seats cost $25. This year's ''Opera for All'' includes four performances, double the number of last year's. It starts on Thursday with a gala concert of highlights from the coming season and continues next weekend with performances of ''Carmen'' and ''La Bohème.'' A party after Thursday's gala will feature the East Village Opera Company, a rock band that bases its music on -- what else? -- opera arias. Alas, ticket prices for the rest of the year will return to normal, but $25 will still get you a seat in the fourth ring. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com. (Midgette)    Classical Music    * BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and is offering ample musical variety this week. Tonight through Sunday, a piano trio of Olga Vinokur, the pianist; Mark Peskanov, the violinist; and Edward Arron, the cellist, offers a new work by Behzad Ranjbaran, commissioned by Bargemusic, as well as the Brahms Trio No. 3 and the Tchaikovsky Trio (Op. 50). On Thursday, the superb pianists Ursula Oppens and Jerome Lowenthal play works by Mozart, Wagner (as arranged by Liszt), Chabrier and Fauré. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35, $20 for students, $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday only. (Allan Kozinn)    ANDREA BOCELLI (Wednesday and Thursday) Clearly still kicking itself for not having given concerts with the likes of Zamfir, Helmut Lotti, André Rieu and other wonders of late-night classical crossover record advertising, the New York Philharmonic was not going to let the popular tenor Andrea Bocelli slip through its net. On the other hand, the orchestra didn't want to look too silly, so it is having it both ways, presenting Mr. Bocelli in his Philharmonic debut -- but outside the orchestra's official season (which begins on Sept. 13), and with its music director nowhere to be seen. Mr. Bocelli's program includes Verdi's Eight Romances (in Berio's orchestrations), and the orchestra, led by Asher Fisch, will play overtures and intermezzos by Verdi, Puccini and Mascagni. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; sold out. (Kozinn)    MAVERICK CONCERTS (Tomorrow) This concert series near Woodstock, N.Y., holds its performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. For the last public concert, Zuill Bailey, a cellist, and Simone Dinnerstein, a pianist, perform Beethoven, Britten and Shostakovich. (The season ends on Sunday with a concert for donors.) At 6 p.m., Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845) 679-8217, maverickconcerts.org; $20. (Kozinn)    MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) String quartets are a focus of this venerable institution in northwestern Connecticut, which closes out its summer season with two performances by the Shanghai Quartet. Tomorrow, the ensemble will be joined by Michael Tree, a violist, and Robert Martin, a cellist, in Brahms's Sextet No. 1 and Schubert's Cello Quintet in C; on Sunday, it offers an all-Beethoven program, with the second and third quartets of Op. 59. Tomorrow night at 6:30, Sunday afternoon at 3, Gordon Hall at Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860) 824-7126, musicmountain.org; $25 at the door, $22 in advance, $12 for students.

(Jennifer Dunning)    PHILADELPHIA LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE (Today through Thursday) During the dance drought in New York City, a trip south might not be a bad idea, and some of the participants in this funky, 10-year-old festival and its sidekick sound worth traveling for. Fourteen groups and artists -- some based in Philadelphia, others from around the world -- will perform this week. Those that sound the most interesting include Kate Watson-Wallace in ''House,'' a piece about memories and shifting emotional landscapes in rooms in a West Philadelphia row house (Tuesday through Thursday), the Jo Stromgren Kompani from Norway in ''The Convent,'' a dance about nuns going mad (Wednesday and Thursday), and the Miro Dance Theater in ''Lie to Me and shorter stories,'' a program of multimedia dances by Antony Rizzi and Amanda Miller, a choreographer with a truly individual voice (Thursday). Through Sept. 16. At various sites in Philadelphia, (215) 413-1318, livearts-fringe.org; $10, $15 and $20, with a few programs free. (Dunning)    RIVER TO RIVER FESTIVAL: EVENING STARS (Wednesday and Thursday) The big late-summer free dance sampler in New York, presented by the River to River Festival with the Joyce Theater and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, plays through next Friday with a salsa evening as a chaser next Sunday. Wednesday's opener is devoted to the Kansas City Ballet in three works, including Twyla Tharp's ''Catherine Wheel Suite''; the others are by Todd Bolender and William Whitener, the company's artistic director. Thursday is oriented toward modern dance, with Battleworks, Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet, Pilobolus and Philadanco. Through Sept. 10.

Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)    BARD GRADUATE CENTER: ' LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. The word sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet, but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper-alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, acquamanilia are now having their first-ever exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The acquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends an undeniable energy. (The serpents are handles.) The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art, a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns and an ongoing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu. (Michael Kimmelman)    * DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith)    'AGNES MARTIN: A FIELD OF VISION: PAINTINGS FROM THE 1980'S,' through March 2007. Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the past two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100. (Holland Cotter)    * FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ÉTIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Cotter)    GUILD HALL MUSEUM: 'ELIZABETH PEYTON,'  through Oct. 22. Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Queen Elizabeth are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. Romantic feeling connects the form and content in Ms. Peyton's work. A kind of erotic yearning animates how she sees her subjects and how she makes her pictures. To paint, Ms. Peyton's works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806. (Ken Johnson)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    KATONAH MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANDROMEDA HOTEL, THE ART OF JOSEPH CORNELL,'  through Sept. 17. Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. In this show the white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled ''Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni'' (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of the artist's adoration. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, ''Hotel de l'Étoile'' (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-9555, katonahmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 or jewishmuseum.org. (Glueck)    * MET: 'TREASURES OF SACRED MAYA KINGS,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of a kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. this is taken out because the met says it's no longer in the exhibition. mcd. Much of the work has never traveled before; m Many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, through Oct. 1. On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Smith)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)    NEUE GALERIE: GUSTAV KLIMT: FIVE PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF FERDINAND AND ADELE BLOCH-BAUER,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)     NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Johnson)    * NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)    * RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS IT? HIMALAYAN ART' This museum is an oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems into a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)    WADSWORTH ATHENEUM: 'AMERICAN SPLENDOR: HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL MASTERWORKS FROM THE WADSWORTH ATHENEUM,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)    Galleries: Uptown    * SARAH SZE: 'CORNER PLOT' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    YES BRUCE NAUMAN There has never been much in the way of ''No'' to the influential Post-Minimalist and sculptor-of-all-trades Bruce Nauman. But this astutely structured, if male-dominated, exhibition considers his importance anew, especially his use of language, neon and the body, and his visceral sense of form. The show's title is taken from a 1989 work by Jessica Diamond that is included, along with pertinent efforts by Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, Glenn Ligon, Jason Rhoades, Peter Coffin, Diana Thater, John Bock and, of course, Mr. Nauman himself. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Sept. 9. (Smith)    Galleries: Chelsea     * GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    HANS RICHTER (1888-1976), DADA; ART AND ANTI-ART This daunting yet partial survey is clogged with late paintings and reliefs that are for the most part elegant pastiches of Constructivism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. But it should be seen for the four short films from the 1920's, in which Richter's formalist and Dada sides balance beautifully, with elegantly Surrealist results. This is especially the case in the luminous ''Ghosts Before Breakfast,'' from 1927, which explores most of film's structural possibilities and segues briskly between abstraction and Hollywood narrative while three skittering bowler hats provide continuity. Maya Stendhal Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, mayastenhalgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, extended through Sept. 23. (Smith)    * JAMES J. WILLIAMS III: 'BY REQUEST, MY EPITAPH' Despite debts to artists like Jack Pierson, Karen Kilimnik, Richard Prince and Nan Goldin, this Haversham-ish environment and solo debut exude a promising fusion of modesty and narcissism. Its deep teal walls display scores of Polaroids, drawings, collages, notebooks and thrift-shop-worthy paintings, along with many of the artist's well-worn belongings. An illusion of stylish, if impoverished, full disclosure results. Self-conscious bohemianism teeters between nostalgia and irony, and art emerges as an incessant if nonchalant activity at the center of an eked-out existence. Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 242-7524, envoygallery.com, through Sept. 9. (Smith)    Other Galleries    'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org through Oct. 16. (Johnson)    Last Chance    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GRAFFITI' Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes Sunday. (Johnson)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual, reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes Monday. (Smith)    * MET: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes Monday. (Smith)    MET: 'ON PHOTOGRAPHY: A TRIBUTE TO SUSAN SONTAG,' How to honor the memory of a multifarious figure like Susan Sontag? The Metropolitan Museum's solution -- a small, grave, beautiful photography show -- is an apt one, with pictures by many of the artists she wrote about, from Diane Arbus to Walker Evans, a portrait of one of her early heroes, Oscar Wilde, and two of Sontag herself. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes Monday. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and usable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org; closes Sunday. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: DOUGLAS GORDON: 'TIMELINE,' This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes Monday. (Johnson)    MARTIN SCHOELLER: 'CLOSE UP' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedhunt.com; closes today. (Johnson)    * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes Sunday.
