(Photo: Justin Sullivan/Associated Press))   Updated, 7:19 PM  More than a week ago, a computer technician decided to take out his frustrations on his employer, the city of San Francisco. Terry Childs's alleged handiwork, as officials soon found out, was disturbing.   Using his digital keys to the kingdom, he locked out everyone else at an administrative level from a network holding e-mails, city payroll files, confidential law enforcement documents and jail inmates' bookings, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. Tracing the deed to the saboteur proved to be relatively easy. Getting him to reveal the passwords to reverse his digital spell proved far more difficult.   Until Gavin Newsom, the city's popular and telegenic mayor, entered the fray, that is. On Monday, Mr. Newsom came face to face with the rogue programmer, 43, following his arrest on four felony counts of computer tampering.   If only The Chronicle could sell this news to Hollywood:   The San Francisco computer engineer accused of withholding access codes to the city's network surrendered the password during an unusual jailhouse visit by Mayor Gavin Newsom, authorities said Tuesday.  [...] Childs' defense attorney Erin Crane contacted the mayor's office, setting in motion the secret visit.  The visit was so secret that the mayor did not tell District Attorney Kamala Harris' office or police about it. Newsom decided on his own to accept Crane's invitation, mayoral spokesman Nathan Ballard said.  Wired's Threat Level blog reported more details on the second half of the story, when the nine-day-long episode ended:   ""We were able to regain complete control of the network Tuesday,"" said Ron Vinson, the deputy director of the city's Department of Technology Information Services.  [...] ""The mayor showed up unexpectedly at the data center and provided the engineers and forensic experts on the case on site with the passcodes that Mr. Childs had provided the mayor,"" Vinson said.  What precisely happened when the mayor walked into that jail? There were precious few details so far about their 15 minutes together, even though the Chronicle hinted that Mayor Newsom might have built trust with a widely quoted remark that Mr. Childs was clearly ""very good at what he did"" as the city struggled to fix the problem.  As the imagination stirs about high-stakes deals behind closed doors -- and maybe even a little danger for the city's leader -- Nathan Ballard, the mayor's spokesman, played down the superhero angle just a bit.   ""Childs is not a Boy Scout,"" he said, according to the Chronicle. But ""he's not Al Capone either.""  Update, 7:19 PM In response to statements from authorities, Mr. Childs's lawyer contends that his client has done nothing wrong, and was acting in the best interests of the city. ""This was not a danger to the public,"" the lawyer told The Chronicle. Certainly, many things remain unanswered in this case, as one commenter thoughtfully outlined.

8,Last year may have been the worst season in Notre Dame’s history. Can Charlie Weis help the Irish turn it around in 2008?,https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/blogs/23thequad-the-quad984.html,Last year may have been the worst season in Notre Dame’s history. Can Charlie Weis help the Irish turn it around in 2008?,"Location: South Bend, Ind.  Nickname: Fighting Irish. Is this nickname offensive? Discuss.  (Photo: Charlie Weis is not the only one anxiously waiting to see how Notre Dame will perform this season. (Bill Haber/Associated Press))   Quick facts: The Irish have won 10 games seven times in the last 30 seasons. Over the same time span, Fresno State also has seven seasons with at least 10 victories, Clemson has six and Air Force and Syracuse have five. I'm just trying to make a point here: outside of the tremendous teams under Lou Holtz from 1988-1993 (including the 1988 national champs), Notre Dame has been rather pedestrian. So why do so many college football fans take such delight in watching the Irish fail? Is hatred of the Fighting Irish something that is handed down from father to son, generation to generation? And why will most loyal readers of the Countdown have a conniption about Notre Dame's ranking on this list?   Tidbit: Let's just get this out of the way. How bad was Notre Dame a season ago? The nine losses were the most in program history. The 0-5 opening was the worst start in program history. The loss to Navy in early November was their first setback in the series in 44 years; Notre Dame's loss to Air Force a week later marked the first time the Irish had lost to two service academies in the same season since 1944. Those two losses contributed to a 1-6 home record, also the worst in program history. The Irish averaged 16.4 points and 242.2 yards per game, two of the worst totals in program history. O.K., we get it. It was the worse year in the long and illustrious history of Notre Dame football. Let's move on to next season.  Tidbit (positives edition): A little more than a week ago, in the Countdown's profile of Michigan, we pointed out the Wolverines' place as the winningest team (869) in F.B.S. history, as well as the program with the highest winning percentage (.743). Notre Dame is second in both victories (824) and winning percentage (.738), and has the fewest losses (279) of any team with more than 100 years' experience. The Irish have 12 recognized national championships, the most of any F.B.S. program.  Tidbit (recruiting edition): According to the good people at Rivals.com, Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis is a huge upgrade over his predecessor, the current Washington coach Ty Willingham – at least when it comes to recruiting. Willingham's final three classes (2003-5) averaged a ranking of 28th (12th, 32nd and 40th, respectively), while Weis has averaged a ranking of sixth (eighth, eighth and second from 2006-8). On the other hand, Weis's successful two-year stretch from 2005-6 (19-6 over all) was largely accomplished using Willingham's key players, such as quarterback Brady Quinn, wide receiver Jeff Samardzija and running back Darius Walker.   Former players in the N.F.L.: 51 – DE Victor Abiamiri (Philadelphia Eagles), WR Arnaz Battle (San Francisco 49ers), DE Bertrand Berry (Arizona Cardinals), OL Jordan Black (Houston Texans), LB Rocky Boiman (Philadelphia Eagles), DT Darrell Campbell (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), TE John Carlson (Seattle Seahawks), K John Carney (Kansas City Chiefs), TE Jerome Collins (Giants), S Deke Cooper (Atlanta Falcons), S Glenn Earl (Houston Texans), OL Jeff Faine (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), TE Anthony Fasano (Miami Dolphins), RB Tony Fisher (Jets), TE Marcus Freeman (Giants), DE Chris Frome (Chicago Bears), OL Mike Gandy (Arizona Cardinals), WR David Givens (Tennessee Titans), RB Ryan Grant (Green Bay Packers), OL Ryan Harris (Denver Broncos), P Ryan Hentrich (Tennessee Titans), WR Carlyle Holiday (Green Bay Packers), LB Grant Irons (Oakland Raiders), RB Julius Jones (Seattle Seahawks), DT Derek Landri (Jacksonville Jaguars), DT Trevor Laws (Philadelphia Eagles), OL Mark LeVoir (St. Louis Rams), DT Lance Legree (New Orleans Saints), OL Travis Leitko (Indianapolis Colts), OL Sean Mahan (Pittsburgh Steelers), LB Corey Mays (Cincinnati Bengals), OL Jim Molinaro (Dallas Cowboys), S Chinedum Ndukwe (Cincinnati Bengals), TE John Owens (Detroit Lions), OL Luke Pettigout (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), QB Brady Quinn (Cleveland Browns), CB Mike Richardson (New England Patriots), OL Mike Rosenthal (Miami Dolphins), CB Allen Rossum (San Francisco 49ers), OL Dan Santucci (Cincinnati Bengals), S Gerome Sapp (Baltimore Ravens), P Hunter Smith (Indianapolis Colts), OL Dan Stevenson (Houston Texans), WR Maurice Stovall (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), OL John Sullivan (Minnesota Vikings), DE Justin Tuck (Giants), RB Darius Walker (Houston Texans), DE Anthony Weaver (Houston Texans), DE Renaldo Wynn (Giants), DE Bryant Young (San Francisco 49ers), S Tom Zbikowski (Baltimore Ravens).  Famous alumni (non-football related): The TV talk show hosts Regis Philbin and Phil Donahue; the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edwin O'Connor (""The Last Hurrah""); the actor George Wendt; Congressman Peter King of New York; the legendary sportswriter Red Smith.    Team Information  Conference: Independent.  Head coach: Charlie Weis ('78 Notre Dame), 22-15 after three seasons at his alma mater. Weis was a speech and drama major as an undergraduate, perhaps the reason why his sideline outbursts are so … well, colorful. A longtime N.F.L. assistant before taking on the Notre Dame job, coaching 10 years under Bill Parcells (1990-92 with the Giants, 1993-96 with Patriots, 1997-1999 with the Jets) and another five under Bill Belichick (2000-4 with the Patriots), Weis won four Super Bowls as an assistant (1990 with the Giants, 2001 and 2003-4 with the Patriots) – including the last three as offensive coordinator – and participated in another (1996 with the Patriots). Perhaps his most acclaimed coaching job came in 2001, when Weis broke in an unproven, inexperienced quarterback (one Tom Brady) while orchestrating the Patriots offense to a Super Bowl title. When it comes to his tenure at Notre Dame, let's start with the positives: after inheriting a program in disarray following the firing of Willingham, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back B.C.S. game appearances (justified or not) en route to setting a Notre Dame record with 19 victories in his first two seasons as head coach. He created an offense, led by Quinn, that was among the best in Notre Dame history (a program-record 440 points scored in 2005). That 2005 season (a 9-3 finish) earned Weis the National Coach of the Year award. Last fall's 3-9 debacle took much of the shine off his tremendous two-year run, leaving many Irish fans wondering about the direction of the program. Another poor season would place his job firmly in jeopardy. Weis, whose gargantuan $4 million contract (the largest contract in the F.B.S., eat your heart out Kirk Ferentz) runs through 2015, is only a half game better than Willingham (21-15 from 2002-4) through three seasons. Though he is an upgrade over Willingham – especially in recruiting – that record raises some questions. Seat temperature check: humid.  2007 record: 3-9, the most losses in program history. We already rehashed the overwhelming evidence in support of 2007 being the worst season in Irish history (well, Notre Dame history; it still trails the Great Famine by a wide margin), but there were a few bright points in an otherwise forgettable campaign. The sophomore quarterback Jimmy Clausen – the player everyone seems to root against – had one of the better freshman seasons for a quarterback in N.D. history, while the Irish got solid receiving play from the underclassmen Duval Kamara, Robby Parris and George West. The defense received inspired play from end Trevor Laws, as well as typically hard-nosed action from safety Tom Zbikowski. The punting game was also strong, as Geoff Price graduated with the program's second-best career average. O.K., so we're reaching a bit. Though the season may not have begun with national title hopes, the general consensus was that the Irish were still an eight-win team; it wasn't even close, as Notre Dame flopped out of the gate with an 0-5 start, and sat at 1-9 before winning its last two games.   High point: The best of Notre Dame's three wins was a 20-6 victory over U.C.L.A. on Oct. 6, a victory that snapped N.D.'s seven-game losing streak. After losing the next four, Notre Dame beat Duke by 28-7 and Stanford by 21-14 to end the season.   Low point: The Irish lost their first five games by a combined score of 166-46, the worst being a 38-0 loss at Michigan, a game both team entered with an 0-2 record. The rivalry game with U.S.C. was also a 38-0 laugher. Two years prior, the pair played perhaps the best college football game of the decade; this one wasn't as close. The aforementioned losses to Navy and Air Force cemented the 2007 team as the program's worst.  Tidbit (winning streak edition): The Irish enter the 2008 season on a two-game winning streak, their longest streak to start a season since 1993 (seven games). How is that possible, you may ask? See below for more details.  Tidbit (bowl edition): The Irish have lost nine consecutive bowl games (dating back to 1994), the longest string of bowl ineptitude in N.C.A.A. history. Each of the last five losses have come by at least 14 points, including a 27-point loss to L.S.U. in the 2007 Sugar Bowl.   Returning starters: 15 (9 offense, 6 defense).  Key losses  On offense, the Irish only lost two starters off last year's inexperienced unit: tight end John Carlson and center John Sullivan. Carlson picked up where his predecessor, the current Miami Dolphin Anthony Fasano, left off, leading the team in receptions (40) and receiving yards (372). Carlson's three touchdown grabs were good for second on the team. The 38th overall pick in April's draft (Seahawks), Carlson was a terrific fit in Weis's pro-style offense. Sullivan, who played his high school ball in Greenwich, Conn., was a member of the Rimington Trophy watch list in both 2006-7. Despite battling injuries a senior (he missed the season's final three games), Sullivan remained among the nation's top centers, and will be missed on the interior of the Notre Dame line. A sixth-round pick of the Vikings, he is in position to apprentice one season under the All-Pro Matt Birk before battling for the starting job in 2009.  On defense, the losses are bit more severe, especially in the case of the standouts Laws and Zbikowski. Laws led all defensive lineman in the F.B.S. with 112 tackles, while also leading the Irish with four sacks. He was the team M.V.P. for the 2007 season, and deservedly so: he was the lone Notre Dame defender – and perhaps the lone player, period – who excelled week after week despite the team's disappointing results. Laws played end in the 3-4 defense, but at 6-0, 304 pounds, projects as a defensive tackle at the next level. His production, and leadership, will be sorely missed in 2008. He followed Carlson as a second-round pick (47th over all), landing with the Eagles. Though Zbikowski never seemed to recapture the tremendous play he exhibited as a sophomore, he departs South Bend as a two-time all-American and an integral part of a pass defense that allowed only 161.6 yards per game last fall. That total was the best by an Irish defense since 1996. As a senior, Zbikowski finished fifth on the team in tackles with 80, adding two picks. He again served as an asset in the return game, averaging 10.2 yards per return; as a pro, he may make an early impact on special teams. Weis and his staff will attempt to offset the loss of inside linebacker Joe Brockington (108 tackles, a team-leading 8.5 for loss) by committee, though the junior Toryan Smith seems to be the favorite for the starting spot. One underclassman who will not be playing for the Irish in 2008, though he may return next season, is the would-be junior cornerback Darrin Walls, who left school for personal reasons. Walls started 11 games in 2007, making 32 tackles and an interception. He was expected to occupy one starting corner spot.  Tidbit (N.F.L. draft edition): After going from 1998-2006 with no more than two players taken on the first day of the draft, the Irish have had three players go on Day 1 each of the last two seasons: Quinn (1st round, 22nd over all), Victor Abiamiri (2nd, 57th over all) and Ryan Harris (3rd, 70th over all) in 2007, and Carlson, Laws and Zbikowski (3rd round, 86th over all to the Ravens) in 2008.   Players to watch: It all starts at quarterback, where Clausen enters his second season as the undisputed future of the Irish program. Though he may face some competition from the incoming freshman Dayne Crist, Clausen showed enough over the last three games of the season (636 yards, six touchdowns against one pick) to justify his ranking as the best high school recruit in the country in 2007. Thrust into the starting role in the second week (no freshman Q.B. in Notre Dame history had ever started prior to the fourth game of his rookie season), Clausen went through the inevitable struggles, losing his first four starts while struggling to move the ball. While most of his early ineffectiveness can be traced to inexperience, some of the blame must fall upon Clausen's slow recovery from off-season elbow surgery. Clausen ranks second on Notre Dame's freshman quarterback list in terms of passing yards (1,254), completions (138), attempts (245) and completion percentage (56.3 percent). He may not be among the 10 best quarterbacks in the country, but Clausen's projected development in 2008 is a story line to watch. His favorite target is the lanky sophomore wideout Duval Kumara, who at 6-5, 222 pounds, certainly looks the part of an N.F.L. receiver. He played well enough as a freshman – a N.D. rookie record 32 receptions and 4 touchdowns – to project well for the next level. One receiver to remember is the sophomore Golden Tate, who caught six balls for 131 yards last fall, a 21.8 yards-per-catch average. Weis and the new offensive coordinator Mike Haywood need to find ways to get him the ball. Other productive weapons include the senior David Grimes (27 receptions, 224 yards) and the junior Robby Parris (29 for 361). Up front, the Irish return four starters, including the junior right tackle Sam Young, who has started all 25 games since arriving in South Bend in 2006. Though he has started at both tackle spots with the Irish, Young will move permanently to the right side this fall, with the senior Paul Duncan protecting Clausen's blindside. Tight end, all important in the Notre Dame offense, lost a productive senior in Carlson, but the position looks to be in solid shape in 2008 and beyond with the sophomore Mike Ragone (one reception for seven yards in 2007) and the incoming freshman Kyle Rudolph, the nation's top tight end recruit. On the defensive line, the Irish staff hopes the sophomore Ian Williams, a freshman all-American in 2007, can help replace some of Laws's lost production. His 45 tackles a season ago, sixth on the team, was the third-most by a freshman lineman in Notre Dame history. Linebacker looks like a strength, especially with the senior Maurice Crum Jr. returning in the middle: Crum, who had 84 tackles last season, enters his final season with 241 career stops and 37 career starts, most on the team. Crum will get help from the sophomore Brian Smith, who is penciled in at one of the outside linebacker spots. Smith was one of a number of freshman defenders who made an impact a season ago, recording 25 tackles, 1.5 sacks and an interception. Though Notre Dame will need to replace two starters in the secondary, they return two experienced seniors in free safety David Bruton and corner Terrail Lambert. Bruton, in addition to leading the team with three interceptions, is Notre Dame's leading returning tackler (85, 4.5 for loss). Lambert, whose 22 consecutive starts is second only to Crum's 37, has 74 tackles and 4 picks over the last two seasons. With the loss of Zbikowski, and now Walls, Lambert and Bruton will be integral to the success of the entire defense.  Position battle to watch: Losing a starting cornerback like Walls is often difficult to overcome, but corner is one position where the Irish seem to be in pretty good shape. His backups, the junior Raeshon McNeil and the sophomore Gary Gray, were battling for the nickel spot but are now in line to earn a starting job in the Irish secondary. McNeil has played in 22 games over his two seasons in South Bend (nine tackles and a sack last fall), taking snaps at both corner and safety, while Gray missed all of last season due to injury. The real issue for the Irish will be finding a consistent running game, something that eluded them through much of the 2007 season; the Irish finished 117th in the F.B.S. in rushing offense (903 yards). The junior James Aldridge is the team's leading returning rusher after a 463-yard 2007 season, including two 100-yard games. Though he enters the fall atop the depth chart, he will be pushed through camp and into the season by the sophomores Robert Hughes and Armando Allen. Hughes burst onto the scene in the season's final two games, rushing for 246 yards (7 yards per carry) and 2 touchdowns in victories over Duke and Stanford; he became the first Notre Dame freshman back to break 100 yards in back-to-back games since Allen Pinkett in 1982. Allen was second on the team with 348 yards, though he made additional contributions in the passing game (24 receptions for 124 yards) and on special teams (a team-record 704 kick return yards). One of three needs to step up and take the starting job, though Allen seems better suited as third-down or change-of-pace back. If I were Weis, I would give Hughes the rock until he shows the last two games of 2007 were a fluke.   2008 schedule:  Sept. 6 San Diego State Sept. 13 Michigan Sept. 20 @ Michigan State Sept. 27 Purdue Oct. 4 Stanford Oct. 11 @ North Carolina Oct. 25 @ Washington Nov. 1 Pittsburgh Nov. 8 @ Boston College Nov. 15 Navy (in Baltimore) Nov. 22 Syracuse Nov. 29 @ U.S.C.  Game(s) to watch: The usual rivalry games, Michigan and U.S.C. specifically. The Irish have lost the last two to the Wolverines by a combined score of 85-21, while Weis is 0-3 against the Trojans, the last two losses coming by at least 20 points. Notre Dame has to win home games against San Diego State, Stanford and Syracuse, the three most winnable games on the schedule.  Season breakdown & prediction: Like most college football fans, I don't drink the Notre Dame kool-aid. I think they are perennially over-ranked, receive undue acclaim and publicity, and are often unworthy of the attention paid to them by the college football world. The only reason I say this is to dissuade any reader who may think what I'm about to say is biased by a pro-Notre Dame agenda: I think Notre Dame is going to markedly better in 2008, perhaps even – gasp – six wins better. This is due to a number of reasons. One, the definite improvement on offense. Yes, it truly can't get any worse, but the Irish will have a healthy Clausen – who was greatly improved down the stretch – and a deeper, more experienced line, which will help the running game. Losing Laws up front hurts, but the Irish hope the potential group of Williams, the senior Justin Brown and the junior Morrice Richardson can help offset his departed production. At linebacker, an integral part of the 3-4 defense, N.D. has a standout in Crum and a number of talented, athletic underclassmen, which will help make the unit better than it was a year ago. The most important thing to remember about the Irish is that those freshman who struggled through last fall are now sophomores, and the experience they gained while struggling through a 3-9 season will pay immense dividends this coming season and beyond. Most important of all, the athletic department has presented the Irish with a workable schedule. There are a number of no-doubt wins on the docket (San Diego State, Syracuse), many probable victories (Navy, Stanford) and a grab-bag of potential victories. Unlike years past, Notre Dame fans do not look at their team's schedule and automatically project three, even four losses before the season even starts. I believe there is only one game – Southern California – that is a definite loss. As for a prediction, I see the Irish at 8-4, a great step forward after last fall and a sign that, just maybe, the program is in good hands.   Dream season: Wipe away those tears, Touchdown Jesus! The Irish finish the season 10-2, losing only at Michigan State and U.S.C., and earn their third B.C.S. bowl appearance (justified or not) under Weis.  Nightmare season: Despite an improvement on offense and an easier schedule, Notre Dame cannot make more than a two-game improvement off of its 3-9 finish of 2007.  Where do Notre Dame fans congregate: There are dozens of fan sites to comb through, but the Countdown gives you the cream of the crop. For message boards and recruiting sites, check out Irish Illustrated, Blue and Gold, Irish Eyes and Irish Envy. Other good resources include Irish Sports Report and N.D. Nation.   Who is No. 36?: This program went 2-21 from 2001-2, but has won at least eight games four of the last five seasons.
