The name is a sly reference to the New Wave of the 1960's, when English and American writers as varied as Michael Moorcock, J. G. Ballard, Harlan Ellison and Samuel R. Delany cast a suspicious eye on genre staples like space travel and future technology. The Next Wave -- which, depending on who's counting, includes British novelists like M. John Harrison, Richard K. Morgan and Neal Asher -- mixes left-leaning politics and a taste for horror into cautionary tales of societies gone wrong at the core.",The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Macleod, Ken', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Mieville, China', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Hearn, Lian', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Haldeman, Joe', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'CAMOUFLAGE (BOOK)', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'BRILLIANCE OF THE MOON, THE (BOOK)', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': ""NEWTON'S WAKE (BOOK)"", 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'IRON COUNCIL (BOOK)', 'rank': 10, 'major': 'N'}]",2004-07-18T05:00:00+0000,article,Book Review Desk,Books,,Review,nyt://article/c99e730e-4bfe-593e-95a2-d6feffad5081,1053,nyt://article/c99e730e-4bfe-593e-95a2-d6feffad5081,SCIENCE FICTION,,,SCIENCE FICTION,,,,By Gerald Jonas,"[{'firstname': 'Gerald', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Jonas', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,7,19
