0," Theater    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.  ++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for last Friday night.  Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Broadway    + 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $96.25.  BEN BRANTLEY    ++ 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.  BRANTLEY    *++ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by an Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience to prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to David Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.  BRANTLEY    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200 Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.  BRANTLEY    * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    *++ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    *++ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.  BRANTLEY    * 'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (A K A LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. ''Gods,'' which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212) 533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'K.I. FROM CRIME' We can all bring to mind a list of literary characters it might be edifying to spend some time with, but Katerina Ivanovna, from ''Crime and Punishment,'' probably isn't on your list. A minor figure in the novel, she is the miserable, impoverished widow of a hopeless drunk. In a grim scene, she presides over a funeral banquet for her husband. Racked with a consumptive cough, she belittles the seedy guests who have bothered to show up, fumes at the indifference of the more respectable ones who haven't, bemoans the fate of her fatherless children. Now, thanks to the wonders of the contemporary stage, you're invited. Theatergoers who delight in audience participation will not want to miss the New York debut of the Lithuanian-born director Kama Ginkas. Audience members, who are conscripted into the roles of Katerina's guests, must listen patiently to her long tale of woe. But since most of the monologue is delivered in Russian, only those conversant with the language will grasp the nuances of her plight. Ms. Mysina gives a boldly physical, emotionally transparent performance, but there is no development of her character. And while it may seem paradoxical, involving an audience in a theatrical performance tends to lessen its impact. The self-consciousness that results shuts the lid on imaginative empathy (1:30). Freight Entrance Theater, 208 West 37th Street, Manhattan. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $40. Sold out for the run of the show.  ISHERWOOD    *++ 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.  ISHERWOOD    * 'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    + 'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the clichéd. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudités. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed by David Schweizer as if it were a traffic jam, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.  BRANTLEY    Last Chance    *+ 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' Oh, spare a tear for dear old Gilbert and Sullivan! Too wordy to sit comfortably in the opera house, too quaint and old-fashioned for Broadway. Oh, bother not. They're doing just fine, thank you, as the prized property of devoted fans the world over. The New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players have been tending the legacy with loving care for three decades, and are in residence at City Center with an endearing production of ''The Pirates of Penzance.'' Alfred Bergeret, the artistic director of the company, has conscripted Hal Linden at the Major General. The rest of the cast is culled from regulars with the company. Equal measures of experience and affection are blended in their spirited, vocally confident performances (2:30) City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; final performance, Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85.  ISHERWOOD    'THE RIVALS' Here she is at last! Dear old Mrs. Malaprop! The delightful Mrs. M, who, with a disdainful nod to Richard Brinsley Sheridan, misspoke her way to immortality in the pages of the Oxford English Dictionary. You know the word, you've probably made the mistake, and now, courtesy of the new Broadway revival of ''The Rivals,'' Sheridan's celebrated 1775 comedy of manners, you can finally make the acquaintance of the famous dame who generously bequeathed her name to a linguistic error. As personified by Dana Ivey, an actress of blissfully well-honed comic instincts, Mrs. Malaprop is indeed the main event in Mark Lamos's plumply upholstered production. But despite a largely zesty cast and a first-class production, the uncomfortable truth is Sheridan's comedy is one of those approved-and-certified classics that require unexpected reserves of patience and fortitude. Intermittently adorable, it is also, and not infrequently, tedious (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; final performance, Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $85.  ISHERWOOD    'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Snapshots from the past reveal layers of guilt, dissatisfaction and recrimination in the family history. Emotional entrapment, and the desperation it causes, have become obsessive themes in Mr. Allen's work, and they constitute almost the whole fabric of ''A Second Hand Memory.'' Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; final performance, Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At 18 he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelgänger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.  A. O. SCOTT    'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown and Rick Gonzalez. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising instpirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, no relation to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown, as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.  SCOTT    'ELEKTRA' Starring Jennifer Garner, Terence Stamp, Kirsten Prout, Goran Visnjic, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 96 minutes). The latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, ''Elektra'' stars Ms. Garner as a superheroine who dons fetishwear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight. ''Your parents must have had a sense of humor,'' the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to Elektra about her mythopoetic name. She answers in the negative: no they did not and neither does she. This chick may have a complex (or two), but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of Marvel Comics, she emphatically does not have a sense of humor. What she emphatically does have -- and this of course is the entire point of ''Elektra'' -- is a hot bod and a costume that looks as if it was designed by someone very familiar with the Victoria's Secret catalog.  DARGIS    'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on-screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.  DARGIS    * 'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered to the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed by ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a 100-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.  DARGIS    'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (a k a Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.  DARGIS    'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Aquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations.  SCOTT    'A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG' Starring John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Shainee Gabel (R, 119 minutes). In this first feature directed by Ms. Gabel, Mr. Travolta delivers a hammed-up scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in ''Primary Colors.'' This is the story of a down-at-the-heels former star professor and his protégé rotting in the New Orleans house bequeathed them by a legendary folk-blues singer and their partial redemption when the singer's alienated daughter comes to live with them. The film dawdles along aimlessly for two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise. The movie's hokey solemnity suggests ''The Mundane Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood'' or ''The Notebook Goes to the Big Easy.'' The movie is another example of Hollywood going soft and squishy when it goes South.  HOLDEN    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).  DARGIS    * 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.  SCOTT    * 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in the enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick ''Ocean's Twelve,'' crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean -- played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack, Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan, and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.  DARGIS    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micromanaging phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-and-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.  SCOTT    'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles, all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trench mate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken.  DARGIS    'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose résumé hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror and, as in numerous Japanese and Korean titles, his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.  DARGIS    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Mos Def, Benjamin Bratt, David Alan Grier and Eve. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    GREGG ALLMAN AND FRIENDS, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. Moonlighting from the Allman Brothers Band, the weary-voiced singer behind the beefy, soul-tinged keyboard parts leads his own band. It should jam the old songs in less familiar directions. Sunday at 7, with Jeffrey Gaines opening; tickets are $20.  JON PARELES    * SEKOUBA BAMBINO, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Both of Sekouba Bambino's parents were griots in Guinea -- his last name is Diabate, a familiar name for griots -- and despite their better wishes he followed them into music. With a voice that puts a husky penumbra around the soaring arabesques of griot style, in the 1970's he became the lead singer of Bembeya Jazz, one of the many African bands drawn to Cuban music. On his solo albums he finds his own ways to merge griot traditions, pop and a Latin lilt. He also sang with the Afro-Latin fusion group Africando. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 Sunday.  PARELES    BARBEZ, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Barbez, a New York City band, pushes sultry cabaret vocals and the violin and accordion of tango toward skewed extremes. Its repertory includes songs by Kurt Weill and the Residents. Tonight at 8, sharing the bill with Beat Circus; admission is $10.  PARELES    * DERRICK CARTER, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780. Mr. Carter, who has long been one of the country's leading house DJ's, loves to enliven his thwacking beats with all sorts of squiggles and squelches. On ''Live at Om'' (Om), a great double-CD that also includes a set by Mark Farina, Mr. Carter gravitates toward robotic basslines, disembodied voices and scrambled snippets of disco and jazz. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $30, midnight to 2 a.m., $25, after 2 a.m., $30.  KELEFA SANNEH    * GEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500 and B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. George Clinton leads his large, motley band through marathon jams that preach togetherness without uniformity and subversion through pleasure. His funk vamps are constantly mutating, touching on gospel and be-bop, salsa and soul, hip-hop and heavy metal; they're omnivorous and utterly unpredictable, although the flux will doubtless include hits like ''Atomic Dog,''  ''Flash Light'' and ''Give Up the Funk.'' At Starland Ballroom tonight at 8; tickets are $25. At B.B. King tomorrow night at 8, where he shares the bill with a P-Funk alumnus: the keyboardist Bernie Worrell and the Woo Warriors. Tickets are $37.50 in advance, $42 tomorrow.  PARELES    * DR. DOG, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. This emerging Philadelphia band, enamored of light-headed riff-rock and off-kilter ballads, comes to New York to play for its small (but growing) cult of fans. Last year, the group released a charming album called, ''Easy Beat,'' which it plans to reissue this year, through National Parking Records. The album includes nine songs filled with breezy vocal harmonies and unexpected digressions, but the group's live show is much louder and more exuberant, especially when Scott McMicken unleashes one of his wailing, shape-shifting guitar solos. Tomorrow night at 9 (get there early -- Dr. Dog is the opening act), with the Upwelling, Hopewell and the King of France; tickets are $8.  SANNEH    JORDAN KNIGHT, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. A teen generation before 'N Sync squealed for the New Kids on the Block, who included Jordan Knight. He made a solo album in 1999, doing his best to apply his creamy tenor to the latest brittle beats, and he's working on a followup due this year. Tonight at 8, with Honestly opening and guest appearances by Rob Base, Flavor-Flav, Jon Knight and Tommy Page. Tickets are $20.  PARELES    * MATES OF STATE AND REGINA SPEKTOR, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Mates of State is the duo of Kori Gardner and her husband, Jason Hammel. Their new mini-album, ''All Day'' (Polyvinyl), has three playful, infectious new songs (plus a cover of David Bowie's ''Starman'') that are quietly radical in their commitment to equality: her keyboards are as loud as his drums; his words are as important as her ''Da, da, das.'' Ms. Spektor is an inventive singer-songwriter who keeps time on a piano while unleashing knotty, witty rants and songs; last year she released a striking debut album, ''Soviet Kitsch'' (Sire/Warner). Tonight at 10, with Ida; tickets are $14.  SANNEH    * MURK, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. Murk is the Miami-based duo of Oscar G. and Ralph Falcon, who excel at producing and spinning thick, hazy dance tracks that ooze and evolve, occasionally making way for snippets of euphoric vocals. They've done some of their best work on remixes, and earlier this year they turned Yoko Ono's ''Everyman Has a Woman Who Loves Him'' into a woozy, frenetic rhythm experiment, with Ms. Ono's vocals mainly submerged beneath synthesizer snarls and air-raid sirens. Tonight after 10; tickets are $15 in advance, expect to pay more at the door.  SANNEH    HUGH POOL BAND, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 683-6500. Hugh Pool's songs hark back to 1960's rock that was steeped in the blues. His repertory extends from rolling-and-tumbling slide-guitar boogies to neo-psychedelic jams to reflective, down-home hymns that recall the Band. Tonight's first set starts at 10 p.m.; free.  PARELES    * IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION, Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, below Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077. Wiry garage-rock adds a storyteller's intelligence in Ike Reilly's songs, which crank up the guitar riffs before they philosophize. Tonight at 10, with Speedway at 11 and Gene Dreamy and Gary Sincere at 9; admission is $8.  PARELES    THE SMITHEREENS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The ebullient guitars of 1960's rock and folk-rock and 1970's power pop echo in the songs of the Smithereens, which often harness bouyant melodies to sing about disappointments and regret. Tomorrow night at 7:30, with the Good Rats opening; tickets are $25.  PARELES    THE SCENE IS NOW, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The Scene Is Now is in its 30th year of turning stray musical ideas into pop songs that sound jerry-built but definitely are not. Sunday night at 8, with the Wrist & Pistols and Matt Mottel opening; admission is $8.  PARELES    THE TOASTERS/THE PIETASTERS, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Ska got started in Jamaica in the 1960's and was revived in punk-era England in the 1970's; then punk-ska was revived in the United States in the 1980's and 1990's. And some bands are still at it: enough to fill all three floors for a night at the Knitting Factory. Along with the Toasters (formed in 1982) and the Pietasters, this night of uptempo bounce includes the Planet Smashers, the Supervillains, Westbound Train, the Players, Taj Motel Trio, Hub City Stompers, Superspecs, the Drastics, the Scorchers and Tristate Conspiracy. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow.  PARELES    YANNI, Radio City Music Hall (1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street), (212) 632-4000. Pomp meets musicology as Yanni subjugates traditional sounds to his triumphal new age suites and spectacle. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $44 to $104.50.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    * BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. The imperious, Dieterich-like cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise an German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.  HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $40.  HOLDEN    * WESLA WHITFIELD, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212) 308-9455. This San Francisco pop-jazz singer has undergone a personal revolution. A once complacent performer, she now reads a song like a personal short story, her interpretations informed by a keen critical intelligence that views songs as tough-minded dialogues between cynicism and romantic faith. Her new show, ''In My Life'' (inspired by the Beatles song) expresses her complicated feelings about the New Year, which she declares ''has little to recommend it.'' Her solution to her dread is to dream. And the show balances a biting medley of vintage songs about money with soaring renditions of ''Some Other Time,''  ''I Have Dreamed,''  ''Pure Imagination'' and a witchy, seductive ''Bali Ha'i.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; Sunday night at 8. Cover: $50 tonight and tomorrow night, $35 on Sunday; no minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    BLUETOPIA QUARTET, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. A promising new band including the baritone saxophonist Alex Harding, the pianist Lucian Ban, the bassist Brad Jones and the drummer Nasheet Waits. Tonight at 8:30; cover charge is $10.  BEN RATLIFF    RICHARD BONA, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Richard Bona, a New Yorker born in Cameroon, is a fretless bass virtuoso who has performed with Joe Zawinul, Joni Mitchell and Harry Belafonte. While he knows his way around jazz-funk fusion, he is also a singer with the kind of gentle, imploring tenor prized in West Africa. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    GEORGE COLEMAN QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. The tenor saxophonist George Coleman, who is nearing 70, may be an athlete among musicians, but he doesn't go for extremes. He has always been a moderate, with fairly sophisticated harmonic knowledge and a strong blues sensibility, best known for his early work with Miles Davis -- an engagement that lasted for a little more than a year and produced several albums. If his legacy seems elusive compared with the countless musicians who were influenced by his top contemporaries -- Coltrane, Wayne Shorter or Sonny Rollins -- it has still endured, carried by those of similarly modest temperament. Tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11, and 12:30; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    * MARTY EHRLICH SOLO AND DUO WITH GREG COHEN, The Issue Room, 619 East 6th Street, East Village, (718) 812-1129. A veteran of the jazz scene in New York for more than 25 years who has traveled in almost every school of playing, Mr. Ehrlich is a saxophonist and clarinetist who can make you understand that jazz, in all its fragments, has an inner cohesion. Here he will play solo performances, something he hasn't done much lately, and duos with the bassist Greg Cohen. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; admission is $10.  RATLIFF    LOUIS HAYES BAND, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Louis Hayes, whose drumming you might know from the Blue Note hard-bop records of the mid-1960's, is a standard-bearer for this music, an almost classical entity. (He played with Horace Silver and Lee Morgan, among others.) Tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20, with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    BILL HENDERSON AND RENE MARIE, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. Mr. Henderson, a bluesy ballad singer who has long lived in Los Angeles, and Rene Marie, a young New Yorker, represent slices of jazz singing's past and future. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30; limited tickets, $100 to $150.  RATLIFF    * HANK JONES TRIO AND KENNY WERNER TRIO, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Hank Jones, who made his first album in 1947, can improvise with such a minimum of fuss that it's not immediately obvious how many idioms he shuttles among: you hear 30's swing, bebop, drawling blues, a little repeated riff, some refracted harmony. Throughout, there is swing rhythm, sure and steady, and a seemingly endless number of songlike phrases that could conceivably have come from any part of American popular music in the last 50 years. Kenny Werner, who started leading bands in the 1980's, is a pianist with a terrific ear for harmony and a sense of the big picture; he's also able to show you all the good things about free improvising with few of the longeurs. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge at the tables is $25, with a $5 minimum; at the bar, $15 and a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    DAVE LIEBMAN BIG BAND, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. While many others of his late-1960's generation have fallen off in ambition, the soprano saxophonist Dave Liebman has remained dogged about composition and trying different styles, from Brazilian music to rearrangements of late-period Coltrane. He recently recorded a big-band album, ''Beyond the Line'' (Omnitone), with a 19-piece group. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    * BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. With excellent rhythm sections, a preference for tough, athletic group improvisation and a hyper-alert playing style, the saxophonist Branford Marsalis can pull off some of the more satisfying performances among current jazz musicians. His recent album, ''Eternal'' (Marsalis Music) is something new for him: an album of ballads. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    PAT MARTINO TRIO, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. Pat Martino, who came out of Philadelphia in the 1960's, is one of jazz's finest guitarists, with a limpid sound and fast fingers; you'll see guitar students hanging on his every note. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 tonight and Sunday night, $32.50 tomorrow, with a $10 minimum all nights.  RATLIFF    * MULGREW MILLER TRIO WITH GARY BARTZ, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. The much-admired but seldom celebrated pianist Mulgrew Miller proves the efficacy of moderation. His playing commits no extravagance. At an even volume, he balances his improvisations among all the instrument's registers; he also balances bulletlike runs, sweet-and-sour experiments in harmony and rhythmic block-chording, producing just enough sound to ring through the band's. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    YOSVANY TERRY GROUP, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Yosvany Terry, the Cuban saxophonist, has has helped to redefine Latin jazz as a complex new idiom since arriving in New York; his band this weekend includes the trumpeter Avishai E. Cohen, the pianist Luis Perdomo, the drummer Dafnis Prieto and Mr. Terry's brother, the bassist Yunior Terry. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    VISION CLUB, L.E.S. Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street at Rivington, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681. A weekly free-jazz series produced by Arts for Art, the organization that puts on the Vision Festival every May. This weekend's participants are the trumpeter Matt Lavelle, with his band Espiritu; and the saxophonist Jemeel Moondoc's trio. Sets are tomorrow at 7:30 and 9; admission is $10 per set or $15 for the whole evening.  RATLIFF    THE WOLLESONS, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934. A funk-jazz group led by the drummer Kenny Wolleson, who has played all over the map of New York jazz. Tomorrow night at 10 p.m.; no cover or minimum.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'CLAUDIA LEGARE' The composer Robert Ward won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1962 for his operatic adaptation of Arthur Miller's play ''The Crucible,'' a dramatically effective work though with a musically traditional score. The Dicapo Opera is offering New Yorkers a chance to hear a later work by Mr. Ward, the New York premiere of a chamber opera, ''Claudia Legare,'' adapted from Ibsen's ''Hedda Gabler'' and set in South Carolina after the Civil War. Mr. Ward's score is unabashedly conservative. For comparison, consider that when this opera had its 1978 premiere, Messiaen was composing his visionary ''Saint François d'Assise'' and Stephen Sondheim was hard at work on the groundbreaking ''Sweeney Todd.'' But ''Claudia Legare'' has its adherents, including Michael Capasso, the dedicated general director of the Dicapo Opera. The company has gone all out for this production, which runs through this Sunday. A very gratified Mr. Ward, 87, attended last weekend's performances. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, at St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438. Tickets: $47.50.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    Classical Music    AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA As part of its ''Orchestra Underground'' series at Zankel Hall, this new-music orchestra is offering four world premieres, two of them commissioned for the occasion. The works are Jason Freeman's ''Glimmer,'' Carlos Carrillo's ''Algunas Metaforas que Aluden al Tormento, a la Angustia y a la Guerra,'' Dan Trueman's ''Traps Relaxed'' and Eve Beglarian's ''FlamingO,'' in a revised version. The Beglarian work sounds particularly promising: the composer describes it as ''not really an orchestra orchestra piece, but a piece for three simultaneous bands, which include flamingo honks, wolf chasers and other entertaining sounds.'' Steven Sloane, the orchestra's music director, will conduct, and So Percussion will perform with the orchestra, as will Mr. Trueman, who will play violin and electronics in his own work. Tonight at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $32.  ALLAN KOZINN    BARGEMUSIC As a composer dedicated to music education, Paul Hindemith made a project of writing sonatas for virtually every major instrument -- bassoon, tuba, you name it. Tonight at Bargemusic, the floating recital hall docked at Fulton Ferry Landing in Brooklyn (an ideal place for chamber music), you can hear Hindemith's Sonata for flute and piano played by the excellent flutist Michael Parloff and the nimble pianist Steven Beck, as well as Hindemith's Third Piano Sonata, which Mr. Beck will have to himself. Bach, another composer with an interest in music education, fills out the program, with two sonatas for flute and piano and the partita for solo flute. And that's not all at Bargemusic this weekend. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon brings a program of three piano trios by Beethoven, performed by the violinist Paul Rosenthal, the cellist Yehuda Hanani and the pianist Doris Stevenson. Flute and piano program: tonight at 7:30; Beethoven trios program: tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35, seniors $30, students $25.  TOMMASINI    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Aaron Jay Kernis keeps proving that a young American composer can engage the steady interest of performers and audiences. Lorin Maazel conducts the New York Philharmonic in Mr. Kernis's ''Lament and Prayer'' tonight, with the orchestra's concertmaster Glenn Dicterow taking the solo violin part. Mr. Kernis's piece, which had its premiere in 1996, remembers the 50th anniversary of the Holocaust. The piece will be surrounded on the program by Fauré's ''Pelléas et Mélisande'' Suite and the Sibelius First Symphony. Today at 11.a.m. and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $22 to $74 today and $25 to $90 tomorrow.  BERNARD HOLLAND    * NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC ENSEMBLES The musicians of the New York Philharmonic periodically leave Avery Fisher Hall for Sunday afternoon chamber music concerts elsewhere in town. This week, the orchestra's string and wind players are offering a program that includes works by two of the players. Joseph Pereira, the orchestra's assistant principal timpanist, is presenting the world premiere of his Woodwind Quintet, and Vladimir Tsypin, a violinist, will perform his ''Three Songs for Bass and Violin.'' Also on the program are Mendelssohn's String Quintet in A and Brahms's irresistible String Sextet in B flat. Sunday at 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330. Tickets: $28.  KOZINN    * ADAM NEIMAN In 1996, this pianist gave a stunning debut recital that included a stunningly dramatic, colorful account of Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue (BWV 903), a work he will revisit at Town Hall on Sunday afternoon. At the time Mr. Neiman was only 17, but was already a polished, resourceful and imaginative performer. It should be interesting to hear how he plays at the comparatively grand old age of 25. His program, part of the People's Symphony series, also includes Schubert's Sonata in A minor (Op. 143), Prokofiev's Sonata in D minor (Op. 14, No. 2) and a handful of Chopin works, among them the Grand Waltz in A flat (Op. 42), the Waltz in C-sharp minor (Op. 64, No. 2), the Mazurka in A minor (Op. 17, No. 4) and the Ballade in F minor (Op. 52). Sunday at 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680. Tickets: $9 and $11.  KOZINN    CHITOSE OKASHIRO This fine young pianist kicks off the Miller's Theater's festival ''Brahms the Progressive'' (a counter to Lincoln Center's ''Brahms the Classical Romantic'' last fall?). She plays late piano works of Brahms (Opp. 118, 119), followed by presumably kindred music of Takemitsu, Messiaen and Ichizo Okashiro, her brother. Later programs will feature similar juxtapositions of Brahms with modern composers in horn trios, piano quartets, piano quintets and string sextets. Tonight at 8, Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $25.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    OSLO STRING QUARTET This Norwegian foursome performs its New York recital debut with an intriguing program that includes selections from both its national and regional repertory: the United States premiere of a work by the prominent Norwegian composer Lasse Thoresen and the String Quartet No. 5 by the Swedish composer Wilhelm Stenhammar. Rounding out the program with a work from the ''international'' literature, the group will play one of Beethoven's ''Razumovsky'' Quartets (Op. 59, No. 2). Sunday at 2 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20, students and seniors $10.  JEREMY EICHLER    JEAN-CLAUDE PENNETIER This well-regarded French pianist is currently at work recording the complete Beethoven sonatas, but for this New York recital debut in the warm and rounded music room of the Frick Collection, he has assembled an enticing all-French program: Ravel's Sonatine, Fauré's Preludes and Debussy's Preludes, Book I. Sunday at 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. Free, though tickets are required.  EICHLER    RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY The adventurous and admirable Riverside Symphony offers a typically intriguing program tomorrow night, for which the conductor George Rothman is joined by the soprano Ann Panagulias and the male vocal quartet Hudson Shad. An orchestral work, Copland's early, jazz-inspired ''Music for the Theater,'' will be complimented by an actual work of musical theater, ''The Seven Deadly Sins,'' with music by Kurt Weill and texts by Bertolt Brecht. The program also offers the New York premiere of Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon's ''Candelabra III,'' which the orchestra's directors describe as a riveting and deeply personal score. Tomorrow night at 8, Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $45.  TOMMASINI    TAKACS QUARTET Decca Records has just released the final installment of this half-Hungarian, half-English ensemble's Beethoven quartet cycle, and to celebrate, the group is performing the complete series under the auspices of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Its format is mix-and-match: most of the programs offer an early, middle and late quartet (although tonight's includes two early works and nothing from the middle period). A chronological rendering of these works may make more sense for listeners intent on following Beethoven's journey, but for those who aren't taking in the full series, the Takacs's approach has the virtue of showing Beethoven's development in microcosm within each program. The program tonight includes the Quartets in C minor (Op. 18, No. 4), A (Op. 18, No. 5) and A minor (Op. 132). Sunday, the ensemble offers the Quartets in D (Op. 18, No. 3), E minor (Op. 59, No. 2) and E flat (Op. 127). Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $30 to $42, tonight; Sunday is sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office.  KOZINN    VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE New York concert-goers have gotten to know of George Steel as an agitator for contemporary music of all kinds through the bracing and popular programs he presents at Miller Theater. But Mr. Steel is also a fine choral conductor whose other passion is Renaissance and Baroque choral music. On Saturday night the Vox Vocal Ensemble, which Mr. Steel founded, performs a program to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the English Renaissance master Thomas Tallis. And the Rotunda of the Low Library has ideally reverberant acoustics for Tallis's mystical choral music. Tomorrow night at 8, Low Library Rotunda, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $35.  TOMMASINI    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.    CHINESE FOLK DANCE COMPANY The resident company of the New York Chinese Cultural Center in Chinatown evokes history and mythology, creating a theatrical world of carnival rhythms, harvest festivals and military battles. Tomorrow at 2 p.m., Colden Center, Queens College, (718) 793-8080. Tickets: $12.  JACK ANDERSON    * CLASSICAL SAVION Savion Glover has returned. Need we say more? But this is the last weekend to see him -- if there are any tickets left in Fort Knox -- in a program in which he performs almost entirely to classical music. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org. Tickets: $42.  JENNIFER DUNNING    * DANCE ON CAMERA FESTIVAL Produced by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Dance Films Association, the festival will present six different programs in this last of three weekends. Highlights include one of the great video-dance classics, ''Dune Dance,'' from 1978, by Carolyn Brown and James Klosty, in which all ordinary senses of time are altered by the paces of a dancer and the slow surge and retreat of water on the sand. The performers include Sara Rudner and other dancers from the companies of Twyla Tharp and Merce Cunningham (tomorrow at 3:30 p.m.). Other new programs are ''Dancing From the Heart,'' an exploration by Marilyn Hunt of the importance of dance in the Pueblo Indian culture (today at 3:30 p.m.) and ''Tango: A Strange Turn,'' a history of that dance and music form (tonight at 9). Other programs are ''The Gods of Bali'' (today at 1 p.m.); ''The Red Shoes'' (tonight at 6:15), and new dance films from France (tomorrow at 1 p.m.). In connection with the festival, an exhibition of paintings, designs and photographs by Geoffrey Holder will run through January. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center Plaza, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600 or www.filmlinc.com. Tickets: $10; $7 for students, $5 for 65+ for weekday matinees.  DUNNING    ALONZO KING LINES BALLET Alonzo King's work has been seen often recently in New York, performed by the Alvin Ailey company, but this is a rare performance here by his own San Francisco-based troupe. The program includes the New York premiere of ''Before the Blues,'' set to music by Pharoah Sanders, and the intriguingly entitled ''Who Dressed You Like a Foreigner?,'' to music by Zakir Hussain. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place at Washington Square South, Manhattan, (212) 992-8484. Tickets: $20 to $40.  DUNNING    YVONNE MEIER Ms. Meier conjures up mysterious creatures in ''Limpopo, Part II,'' a revision of a 1987 work that uses Expressionist imagery to evoke longing, rage and madness in ''Mad Heidi.'' Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    * EARL MOSLEY'S DIVERSITY OF DANCE Earl Mosley's modern-dance choreography and his committed dancers tend to get the heart beating harder, and this program looks no different, with pieces set to music by composers and performers including Nina Simone, Cyndi Lauper, YoYo Ma, Roberta Flack and Sade. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $18; $12 students and 65+.  DUNNING    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET This is Christopher Wheeldon Weekend at City Ballet, what with a performance of Mr. Wheeldon's thought-provoking ''Polyphonia'' tonight, with an all-star cast dancing to music by Ligeti, and the premiere tomorrow night of ''After the Rain.'' George Balanchine and Peter Martins also manage to get their choreographic say, with an all-Balanchine program tomorrow afternoon. Tonight at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or www.nycballet.com. Tickets: $30-83. For availability of Student Rush tickets at $12, check the company Web site or call (212) 870-7766. The company will also present a ''Ballet Insight'' program, in which company insiders talk about aspects of the ballet, tonight from 6:45 to 7:30 at the City Ballet studios at the Rose Building, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center. Tickets: $8. And Jerome Robbins is the subject of a company seminar featuring the dance writer and Robbins biographer Deborah Jowitt on Monday from 6 to 7:30 p.m. at the State Theater. Tickets: $5. Information on both programs: (212) 870-4074.  DUNNING    * PHILADANCO This august yet vibrant Philadelphia-based company will pay tribute to African-American dance with new and repertory pieces by Christopher Huggins, Bebe Miller and Ronald K. Brown, set to music by Steve Reich, La Voix Bulgare and Led Zeppelin, and Wunmi Olaiya. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, one block from the junction of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Brooklyn, (718) 951-4500. Tickets: $30.  DUNNING    ROSEANNE SPRADLIN ''Future Past'' choreographically reflects on themes of mortality, time and memory with the aid of a commissioned score by John Bischoff that combines electronic music with natural sounds and the ringing of bells. Tonight at 7:30 and 10; tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25.  ANDERSON    ZEPHYR DANCE COMPANY From Chicago, this all-female modern-dance troupe will feature new dances by the company director Michelle Kranicke, who explores food and culture in ''Chewing,'' and the associate director Emily Stein, who explores the dancing body in a solo called ''Migration.' Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Mulberry Street Theater, 70 Mulberry Street, one block south of Canal Street, Manhattan, (212) 349-0126. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    'BLUE,' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through March 6. This cool, offbeat little show is made up of all-blue or mostly blue objects from the permanent collection, including, ceramics, quilts, Shaker ''gift drawings'' and some attractive portraits. In one dated around 1768, a proud young Newport, R.I., belle wears pricey pale blue silk. An 1830 watercolor of a boy named Frederick Buxton was done on the cheap. But while his blue suit has faded with time, his big, candid eyes are as blue as the day they were painted. They make a perfect conclusion to this chromatic take on American social history. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; students, 62+, $7.  COTTER    JAMES GILLRAY, New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089, through Jan. 29. One of the most popular cartoonists of his day, Gillray (1756-1815) produced lively, hand-colored etchings that lampooned major public figures like the king, the queen and Napoleon, and many minor ones, too. At his best, Gillray's draftsmanly skill and visionary imagination puts him in a league with artists like William Blake, James Ensor and R. Crumb. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free.  KEN JOHNSON    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  JOHNSON    THE LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER, Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. Having made possible high-density open-storage displays at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New-York Historical Society, the Henry Luce Foundation has now done the Brooklyn Museum a similar favor. Brooklyn's new ''visible storage'' gallery assembles 1,500 objects from four departments and represents 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas, as well as several years of work by curators, designers and computer programmers. Sleek up-to-date vitrines house often jaw-dropping clusters of related objects: Tiffany lamps and glass; early Native American ceramics; pewter and silver, 19th and 20th-century design objects ranging from chairs to clocks and radios. Displays of Spanish Colonial art and the notebooks of the 19th-century landscapist William Trost Richards amount to mini-exhibitions. Nearly 600 paintings and scores of sculpture are also on view. Computer terminals enable visitors to call up detailed information about each object and to also learn about the inner-workings of the museum. In all, the new gallery represents a welcome departure from the Brooklyn's tendency to pit great works of art against needlessly intrusive installation designs. May its example prevail. Hours and admission: see above.  ROBERTA SMITH    * 'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. Hmmm. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.  GRACE GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    ROSWELL ANGIER, Gitterman, 170 East 75th Street, (212) 734-0868, through Jan. 29. In the early 1970's, this photographer explored a Boston netherworld called the Combat Zone where strip joints and other sex-related businesses flourished. His documentary pictures of strippers and pimps are not sensational but matter-of-fact, tender and sad. A more recent series studying street and bar life in Native American border towns in the Southwest is similarly humane and visually poetic.  JOHNSON    MILTON AVERY: 'ONRUSHING WAVES,' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 29. The sea was always a painterly challenge for Avery (1885-1965) who saw it as a landscape of forms in endless free motion. This show of his seascapes from the 1920's through the 50's includes paintings, watercolors and a selection of his sketchbooks recording trips to seaworthy places. The best of the canvases here are the later ones, larger and much closer to abstraction, done in Provincetown summers. ''Onrushing Wave,'' which gives the show its title, is a white field stroked with horizontal dashes of off-blue; in the foreground is a mountainous white crest that confronts the viewer head on, vertically striated with the same blue. At the painting's bottom, rows of tiny blue ripples giver whispering echo to the upheaval above them. These works stay fresh no matter how often you've seen them.  GLUECK    ANTHONY CARO: 'PAINTED SCULPTURE,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, (212) 744-7400, through Feb. 26. In the 1960's, Mr. Caro diverted into the field of formalist, welded steel sculpture some of the hedonism, playfulness and freedom that were rejuvenating broader sectors of European and American culture. Six works from the 60's and early 70's presented by this show still look infectiously fresh, while three recent assemblages of industrial metal parts exude a comparatively ponderous gravitas.  JOHNSON    JOEL SHAPIRO, Cook Fine Art, 1063 Madison Avenue, near 81st Street, (212) 737-3550, through Feb. 25. This is a fine, economical retrospective of the post-Minimalist sculptor's career. There are not any of the early diminutive houses but there is a small, toylike bronze horse from 1973-4 that may surprise viewers familiar with Mr. Shapiro's oeuvre. Also on hand are dense, blocky abstract sculptures in painted wood and in bronze and elegant, sumptuous geometric drawings on paper in velvety charcoal and vividly colored pastels.  JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Feb. 5. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    * 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown.  COTTER    Galleries: Chelsea    THOMAS ASHCRAFT, CUE, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, through Jan. 29. Mr. Ashcraft's spooky installation in a darkened room is like the workshop of an industrious, 19th-century scholar-mystic that has been carefully preserved as a museum attraction. Two subjects in particular emerge: a presumably fictive place called Heliotown, or the ''Interdimensional City of Friends,'' where the artist is said to live as ''extrapolator in residence''; and the idea of money as the materialized form of energies needed for other-dimensional travel.  JOHNSON    CHARLOTTE BECKET, Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 924-0212, through Feb. 5. Ms. Becket's ''Wishing Well'' is a notable contribution to the department of extreme trash accumulation, kinetic division. Stacked tiers of paper, cardboard, bottles and other sorts of refuse sandwiched between sheets of plywood rise 10 feet in the air. In the middle of this tower of garbage, a vertical conveyor continuously churns up loose debris. It owes a lot to the work of Phoebe Washburn but has its own wacky humor and inventiveness.  JOHNSON    FABIAN BIRGFELD, Josée Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-7990. Through January 29. As the exhibition's press release accurately observes, Mr. Birgfeld's work is 'a reflection on the culture of mobility.' It is visually engaging, too. Small triptychs of photographs depicting airports, train stations and subway passageways are formally elegant; and video sculptures in which elevator doors open and close within vertical wooden structures have an oddly soothing effect. (Johnson)    ROZ CHAST: 'SEASON'S GREETINGS,' Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410. through Jan. 29. For her first New York gallery exhibition, this brilliant cartoonist presents recent cartoons, many of which have appeared in The New Yorker, and a set of eggs brightly painted according to a traditional Ukrainian craft. The eggs bearing images of funny-looking people are amusing, but they don't compete with the cartoons' hilarious and uncannily acute take on the conflicted psychic life of ordinary, white, liberal Americans.  JOHNSON    'CONSTRUCTED IMAGE,' Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 627-3680, through Jan. 29. Though not quite convincing as a theme show, this 15-artist exhibition presents some compelling works, including a small, extraordinarily life-like bronze head with glass eyes by Elizabeth King; a haunting Pop-surrealist painting of an old boxer by Llyn Foulkes; a large collage portrait of a woman made of neatly inlaid pieces of road maps by Matthew Cusick and a bizarrely erudite, diagrammatic painting about the Grand Guignol Theater by Paul Laffoley.  JOHNSON    'THE FURNITURE OF POUL KJAERHOLM AND SELECTED ART WORK,' Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181; R 20th Century, 82 Franklin Street, (212) 343-7979, through Jan. 29. The market-accelerated convergence of art and design proceeds apace with this two-gallery exhibition of severely elegant, Modernist furniture by the Danish designer Poul Kjaerholm (1929-1980) with works by 19 contemporary artists from John Baldessari to Richard Tuttle providing background aesthetic resonance. Many of Kjaerholm's works look like anonymous airport furnishings, but the best have a finely detailed grace.  JOHNSON    EMILE GUEBEHI AND MALICK SIDIBÉ, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701, through Feb. 5. Lively studio portraits from 40 years and curious new photographs of heavy women seen from behind by Mr. Sidibé, the celebrated photographer from Mali, nicely complement the striking painted sculptures by the Ivory Coast-based Mr. Guebehi. Representing big, buxom women naked or partly naked and, in some cases, visibly pregnant, the sculptures look like the works of a self-taught artist with a thing for maternal women.  JOHNSON    KEITH HARING, Alona Kagan, 540 West 29th Street, (212) 560-0670, through Jan. 29. If you liked the New Museum's lively survey of the East Village scene of the 1980's, you will appreciate this selection of paintings and sculptures by one of the best artists to emerge from that cauldron of antic creativity. It includes subway drawings in chalk on black paper; large, dizzyingly patterned canvases and brightly enameled, cut-metal characters. Barking dogs, radiant babies, flying saucers, mythic monsters and all kinds of hyperactive humans animate Haring's delirious cosmic comedy.  JOHNSON    'ONE-ARMED BANDIT,' D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Feb. 12. This three-artist show is notable mainly for its playful installation. Presented in groups of three with each artwork framed by red tape applied to the wall, Polly Apfelbaum's gridded drawings of cartoon blossoms on white velvet, Tony Feher's flattened, glitter-covered found boxes and Joanne Greenbaum's buoyant abstract pictures are displayed in various permutations like slot machine icons.  JOHNSON    'ED RUSCHA, ROBERT FRANK, WALKER EVANS,' Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-9610, through Jan. 29. A fine synergy is generated by this selection of pictures by photographers from three distinct generations. All share an understated, sometimes ironic, sometimes mordantly romantic love for vernacular American culture of the street and the open road. The show includes late Polaroid shots of commercial and traffic signs by Evans; examples from Mr. Frank's beatnik-era masterpiece ''The Americans'' and aerial views of parking lots by Mr. Ruscha.  JOHNSON    THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Feb. 5. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    'FIGHT OR FLIGHT,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through Feb. 18. Six artists were asked to make works about fear and anxiety. Excepting Rico Gatson's kaleidoscopic video punctuated by exploding bombs, none directly address war or terrorism. Amy Gartrell's psychedelic felt banners spoof self-affirmation mantras, Kristin Baker's semiabstract paintings evoke car crashes and Marc Swanson's ship mast with a square sail of stitched-together T-shirts encourages a spirit of adventure. Little carnivorous horses graze on the flesh of a fallen dragon in Ivan Witenstein's large fantasy sculpture and an installation by Wangechi Mutu stages a surrealistic shootout.  JOHNSON    'NYC,' DFN Gallery, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 334-3400, through Jan. 29. This selection of New York City-scapes by more than 40 painters is uneven but has many good things, including: a picture of the Columbia University green from 1975 by Rackstraw Downes; a small, Whistleresque study of office building windows by Alex Katz; a dreamy vision of a Coney Island roller coaster by David Levine; and a finely detailed, overhead picture of an intersection painted in egg tempera by Douglas Safranek with the tender exactitude of an early Renaissance master.  JOHNSON    PINAR YOLACAN: 'PERISHABLES,' Rivington Arms, 102 Rivington Street, between Essex and Ludlow Streets, (646) 654-3213, through Feb. 6. Ms. Yolacan's provocatively discomfiting large photographs portray elderly women in carefully tailored off-white blouses, sweaters or scarves made wholly or partly of raw animal flesh -- tripe and chicken skin, mainly -- purchased from butchers. You can read her pictures as unusually visceral feminist poems about fashion and mortality.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    FRANZ ACKERMANN, 'NONSTOP WITH HHC,' Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, closing tomorrow. This Berlin-based painter who was shortlisted for the 2004 Hugo Boss Prize, has produced a characteristically enveloping, high-energy environment of mural painting and variously sized canvases and works on paper centered around a giant, free-standing, Pop-Cubist style painting apparently representing a crashed airplane. Altogether it makes for a lively but grandiose commentary on the thrills and terrors of globalized modernity.  JOHNSON    * A. BALASUBRAMANIAM, Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, closing tomorrow. The work of this exceptional young artist, based in India, is about the play of material solidity and illusion. His first show at Talwar two years ago included a full-size human form that seemed to pass through a gallery wall; for the current show he has cast his own head in an opaque, waxy substance of a kind used to produce air fresheners, so that the self-portrait will dissolve through slow evaporation. Time and change are also the subjects of other work here. And the whole, spare, resonant show comes together in a sculpture of a single slender branch bristling with sharp thorns and cast in solid gold; the more alluring illusion is, the more be painful it can be.  COTTER    * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D.,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closing on Sunday. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. Most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. Hours and admission: see above.  COTTER    'IN THIS PLACE,' Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473, closing tomorrow. This exhibition of photographs and videos by 15 artists includes works that evoke specific places, like Claudio Nolasco's street-level views of Williamsburg and Francesca Romeo's powerful video record of life in a Lower East Side bar. But too many others look as if they could have been made just about anywhere -- Clifford Owens's sadomasochistic video performance piece set in an empty studio, for example -- and that undermines the thesis of the show's curator, Allen Frame.  JOHNSON    'SO FAR SO CLOSE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM GUADALAJARA,' the Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 277-8343, closing today. This five-artist exhibition is intended to show that Mexico City is not the only scene of serious contemporary art in Mexico. It includes a Delftware motorcycle helmet by Agustin Solórzano; gold-glazed ceramic tacos by Luis Miguel Suro; an absorbing video showing puzzling crowd behavior by Gonzalo Lebrija; Fernando Palomar's mural-scale silhouette of a Dutch landscape painted in orange and white on the wall; and Rem Koolhaas's book ''S,M,L,XL'' cut up into four different size pieces by José Dávila.  JOHNSON    FRATELLI TOSO, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 691-6565, closing tomorrow. Fratelli Toso was a Murano glass-making factory in Venice that operated from 1823 to 1979. This beautiful show presents bottles, vases and bowls made in the murrine technique in which round slices of multi-colored glass canes are melded together before the final shape is blown. The woozy, richly colorful and intensely detailed floral and starburst patterns are riveting to look at and each object is a marvel of luxurious sensuousness. Visual hedonists take note.  JOHNSON    SU-MEI TSE, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, closing tomorrow. This exhibition features the work that won the prize for best national pavilion -- Luxembourg's -- at the 2003 Venice Bienale. It consists of a white neon sign that reads ''[E:r] conditionné,'' and two dreamlike video projections. In one, the artist plays the cello on a grassy, alpine prominence; in the other, men in green janitorial uniforms in a desert use green-bristled brooms to sweep sand into small piles.

1," SUNDAY 1|16    OLD GUITARS  The lute, that dodo of the guitar family, still gets respect from Paul O'Dette. This afternoon Mr. O'Dette performs works by Bach and by Silvius Leopold Weiss, who in addition to being a composer was regarded as the best lutenist of the early 1700's.  Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights; 4 p.m.; $25 to $40.    SEX AND THE 70'S  The actress Olympia Dukakis, who has lately been working on the film version of ''A Confederacy of Dunces,'' takes a break for a reading of a new play by Susan Sandler, the author of the play ''Crossing Delancey.'' Ms. Sandler's newest, ''Under the Bed,'' concerns love and lust among the over-70 set, and Ms. Dukakis will be joined by Phyllis Newman, who won a Tony for her role in ''Subways Are for Sleeping.''  Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan; 7:30 p.m.; $10.    BAGHDAD AND BACK  ''About Baghdad'' steps up from a long ride on the festival circuit for a brief theatrical run; in the documentary, shot in July 2003, the director Adam Shapiro follows the Iraqi exile Sinan Antoon for his first visit to Baghdad since 1991. In a tangle of bureaucracy, filming was stopped repeatedly, but three weeks of interviews resulted in conversations with dozens of Iraqis in neighborhoods ranging from the Shiite ghetto to the rich enclaves.  Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; 9 p.m. (Closes on Tuesday.)    SERIOUS WRITING  C-Span's new program, ''After Words,'' pairs nonfiction authors with experts in the field they have written about. Today's show is a pretty heady match: Sister Helen Prejean, the nun made famous by her book ''Dead Man Walking,'' has recently published ''The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account of Wrongful Executions.'' She is matched with Victoria Toensing, a Washington lawyer and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's criminal division.  C-Span; 6 and 9 p.m.    MONDAY 1|17    THE BIRTH OF COLOR  The director Michael Almereyda spent several years stalking the photographer William Eggleston, whose color photographs of everyday life in the American South created an aesthetic now ubiquitous in the work of art students and advertising executives. Mr. Eggleston is also a hard-drinking, gun-loving, down-home character, qualities that keep ''William Eggleston in the Real World,'' here in its world premiere, from being just another dry art documentary.  Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan; 7:30 p.m.; $10. (Also on Wednesday at 6 p.m.)    CD'S: INDIE-ANA ROCK  The Indiana-based Early Day Miners release ''All Harm Ends Here'' (Secretly Canadian, $15.98) this week; these lo-fi rockers may seem a bit down at the mouth, but they've got enough vim to pack into the van for a national tour, beginning on Tuesday in Lawrence, Kan. On ''Red, White and Black'' (Alternative Tentacles, $13.98), the Southern Californian postpunk outfit the Bellrays still sound as if they're playing in a very fun garage.    SQUATTERS' RIGHTS  The photographer Margaret Morton documented a group of 35 Lower East Side squatters who, from 1993 to 1994, took up residence in a former glass factory, borrowing electricity from the base of nearby streetlights and water from the closest hydrant. Ms. Morton's pictures depict a cozy communal home with more graffiti and less Ikea furniture than the Alphabet City of 2005.  Urban Center Galleries, 457 Madison Avenue, at 50th Street; 11 a.m to 5 p.m. (Through Wednesday.)    TUESDAY 1|18    FINNISH MODERN  Scandinavia House puts forward an exhibition about super-groovy Finnish churches that -- half cold-war bunker, half monument to Modernism -- reinvented the way houses of worship could look. Also: beginning tomorrow, Scandinavia House will screen the Icelandic, Swedish, Danish and Finnish films officially offered for Oscar consideration as best foreign-language film.  58 Park Avenue, near 38th Street. Information: www.scandinaviahouse.org.    COMMON SENSE  Historical-document enthusiasts take note: a rare first edition of Thomas Paine's pamphlet ''Common Sense,'' published in 1776, goes on view today at the New-York Historical Society -- alongside the only surviving portrait of the author painted from life.  Central Park West at 77th Street; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; $10, $5 students and seniors.    DVD'S: FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS  The timely if odd 1993 Kathleen Turner flick ''House of Cards'' finds the husky-voiced actress trying to cure her daughter's autism (Lions Gate, $14.98). ''Friday Night Lights'' (Universal, $29.98; includes deleted scenes) is the actor-turned-director Peter Berg's take on the high school football book of the same name, written by his cousin, H.G. Bissinger.    BERLIOZ RECITAL  The sparkly Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova is appearing at the Met in ''Turandot.'' Tonight, her recital will include works by Berlioz, Gounod and Tchaikovsky.  Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall; 8 p.m.; $35.    WEDNESDAY 1|19    ACTORS AND ANIMALS AT THE BALLET  Tonight at the New York City Ballet: Jerome Robbins's 1974 ''Goldberg Variations'' and the last night of ''Carnival of the Animals,'' which brings back the actor John Lithgow in the tale of a boy who spends the night at the American Museum of Natural History.  New York State Theater, Lincoln Center; 8 p.m.; $30 to $73.    EARLIER GENERATION, SAME FEAR  In 1974 -- years before Columbine -- 17-year-old Anthony Barbaro opened fire from inside his high school in Olean, N.Y., killing three and wounding nine. From his story, Bonnie Culver has fashioned ''Sniper,'' an unusual coming-of-age play set after the shooting but before the trial. ''Sniper'' has made its way from performances in Los Angeles and Red Bank, N.J.; previews begin today.  Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Feb. 12.)    THE ART OF ADVERTISING  If only Andy Warhol were alive to see it: ''A Consumer's Guide to Times Square Advertising,'' a new project by the New York artist Christine Hill. The pamphlet, in the form of a hand-held wheel chart, will be distributed by cigarette girls throughout Times Square today. In addition, guided tours of our beacons of product promotion will depart from the Times Square Information Center at 1560 Seventh Avenue (between 46th and 47th Streets) at 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. today.  Noon to 3 p.m., 5 to 7 p.m.    INSIDER ARTIST  Ray LaMontagne is being acclaimed as a hot new outsider crooner (he lives in Maine, not Brooklyn, and worked in a shoe factory, not a Starbucks), but unlike so many other artists who tout their wrong-side-of-the-tracks origins, he sings ballads with a radio-friendly appeal. And even within the heavily trodden territory of country soul, his rough and Otis Reddingish voice stands out.  Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $15.    THURSDAY 1|20    FROM BULGARIA WITH LOVE  An American engineer goes to Bulgaria in the 1920's and disappears. But even after the newspapers back home report his presumed death, his daughter continues to receive his packages, stuffed with exotic travel tales. ''Lyubo,'' a theater and dance piece by Chris Green, is accompanied by a score for piano, tubas and two singers -- and, by the way, is performed entirely by puppets.  Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village; 8:30 p.m.; $20. (Through Jan. 30.)    OLD PHANTOM, NEW MUSIC  Three silent films in three nights with very special accompaniment: on Wednesday Richard Marriott and the Club Foot Orchestra perform a new score -- with gamelan -- for the 1935 silent film ''Legong: Dance of the Virgins.'' Tonight the orchestra takes on Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 film ''Battleship Potemkin.'' And on Friday, a very different ''Phantom of the Opera'' -- Rupert Julian's 1925 version -- is matched with the world premiere of Mr. Marriott's score.  World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan; 7 p.m.; free.    VISITING DANCERS  Zephyr Dance, a 15-year-old company of female dancers based in Chicago, makes its second trip to New York. Its 90-minute program brings two pieces from repertory and two debuts, including ''Chewing,'' an abstract exploration of food and its pleasures and pains.  Mulberry Street Theater, 70 Mulberry Street, Chinatown; 8 p.m.; $15, $10 students. (Also on Friday and Saturday.)    FRIDAY 1|21    DOCTOR KATZ  The painter Alex Katz, master of the flat face and perhaps the last of the Pop artists, subjects himself to audience questions after his public talk tonight with David Cohen, who is the art critic for The New York Sun. Mr. Katz opens a new exhibition at the University of South Florida, Tampa, this week.  Ise Culture Foundation, 555 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, SoHo; 6:30 p.m.; $5.    MOVIES THIS WEEKEND: MILK AND HONEY  New in independent film: In ''Head-On'' (at the Angelika Film Center), two Turkish Germans marry to appease the bride's conservative family; strangely enough, the match creates conflict. ''Watermarks'' (at the Quad Cinema), a documentary, interviews the female swimmers of Hakoah, a Jewish sports association, who fled Austria in 1938. Though the surviving members are now in their 80's, the film finds them still in the pool.  Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village. Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village.    OUR TIME  Our Time Theater Company is made up of teenagers who stutter; it is intended as a haven from the fast-paced and shaming world that stutterers often face. This weekend three one-acts that they wrote and directed will be performed by professional actors.  Theater 3, 311 West 43rd Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $10. (Through next Sunday.)    AND YET MORE VISITING DANCERS  Alonzo King's company from San Francisco, Lines Ballet, brings a new work, ''Before the Blues,'' which is set to music by Pharoah Sanders. The piece is more allusive than narrative, but distinctly taps images of slavery, the Civil War and the history of black men in America.  Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village; 8 p.m.; $20 to $40, $12 for New York University students. (Through next Sunday.)    SATURDAY 1|22    BEDSIDE VENOM  The nonprofit White Horse Theater Company has been plowing its way through the works of Sam Shepard. The latest installment, ''The Late Henry Moss'' (the original production of which was captured in the 2003 documentary ''This So-Called Disaster: Sam Shepard Directs the Late Henry Moss''), plunks two nasty brothers at their father's deathbed in a shack.  Creative Place Theater, 750 Eighth Avenue, near 47th Street; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Feb. 6.)    CALLING ALL VESPAS  For the mods: the Pietasters, the Supervillains, the Toasters, the Drastics and a whole mess of other bands put on three floors of ska music at the Knitting Factory tonight. Expect the pegged pants and parkas of the 80's to be on widespread display.  74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa; 7:30 p.m.; $17, $15 in advance.    THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CANAL  The Perry Street Theater reopens after nearly a decade in the dark for previews of ''Shylock.'' Written and played by Gareth Armstrong, a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, ''Shylock'' takes on Shakespeare's most controversial Jewish role. The performance works as either an antidote or a counterpoint to the current cinematic release of ''The Merchant of Venice,'' starring Al Pacino.  31 Perry Street, West Village; 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.; $55.

Broadway    ++ 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $96.25.  BEN BRANTLEY    + 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St.-Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    + 'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.  BRANTLEY    +++ 'PACIFIC OVERTURES' The director Amon Miyamoto dazzled New Yorkers at the Lincoln Center Festival two years ago with his visiting Japanese-language production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's 1976 musical about American gunboat diplomacy as visited on 19th-century Japan. Now Mr. Miyamoto has revisited the show with an English-speaking, predominantly Asian-American cast, including B. D. Wong as the wryly omniscient narrator. The show's scenic and conceptual elements are essentially the same. including the amusing representation of Commodore Perry as a feral barbarian. But something has definitely been lost in the retranslation. The production does give beguiling due to Mr. Sondheim's silken, silvery score with orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. But an uneasy tentativeness pervades the stage like a mist of perspiration (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25.  BRANTLEY    + 'THE RIVALS' Here she is at last! Dear old Mrs. Malaprop! The delightful Mrs. M, who, with a disdainful nod to Richard Brinsley Sheridan, misspoke her way to immortality in the pages of the Oxford English Dictionary. You know the word, you've probably made the mistake, and now, courtesy of the new Broadway revival of ''The Rivals,'' Sheridan's celebrated 1775 comedy of manners, you can finally make the acquaintance of the famous dame who generously bequeathed her name to a linguistic error. As personified by Dana Ivey, an actress of blissfully well-honed comic instincts, Mrs. Malaprop is indeed the main event in Mark Lamos's plumply upholstered production. But despite a largely zesty cast and a first-class production, the uncomfortable truth is Sheridan's comedy is one of those approved-and-certified classics that require unexpected reserves of patience and fortitude. Intermittently adorable, it is also, and not infrequently, tedious (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $85.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200 Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.  BRANTLEY    *+++ 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    + 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she has met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. This movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49 Ms. Goldberg is an established performer and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25.  ISHERWOOD    *+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    'FAT PIG' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    *++ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.  BRANTLEY    + 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  ISHERWOOD    *+ 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.  ISHERWOOD    * 'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Sam Shepard (yep, that one) and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. Beginning Tuesday, Arliss Howard replaces Mr. Shepard. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' Oh, spare a tear for dear old Gilbert and Sullivan! Too wordy to sit comfortably in the opera house, too quaint and old-fashioned for Broadway. Oh, bother not. They're doing just fine, thank you, as the prized property of devoted fans the world over. The New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players have been tending the legacy with loving care for three decades, and are in residence at City Center with an endearing production of ''The Pirates of Penzance.'' Alfred Bergeret, the artistic director of the company, has conscripted Hal Linden at the Major General. The rest of the cast is culled from regulars with the company. Equal measures of experience and affection are blended in their spirited, vocally confident performances (2:30) City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85.  ISHERWOOD    'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    + 'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the clichéd. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. Fridays at 7 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 and 6 p.m. Beginning Tuesday, the performance schedule is Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudités. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed by David Schweizer as if it were a traffic jam, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.  BRANTLEY    Last Chance    'THE FOREIGNER' Matthew Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There is no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. Directed by Scott Schwartz, the production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.  BRANTLEY    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'THE ASSASSINATION OF RICHARD NIXON' Starring Sean Penn, Don Cheadle, Jack Thompson and Naomi Watts. Directed by Niels Mueller (R, 95 minutes). On Feb. 22, 1974, Samuel Byck, a onetime tire salesman and failing family man, entered the ranks of pseudo-celebrity by trying to commandeer a commercial airliner and crash it into the White House. He didn't get far, which is why the man who would be Booth is a footnote to history rather than a chapter. Earlier this year, three decades after Byck's flameout, this provocatively titled film had its premiere at the Cannes festival. Directed by a first-timer, it stars Mr. Penn as a character inspired by the man who hoped to drop a 747 on the White House and incinerate Dick Nixon. Mr. Penn, as is his wont, acts up a storm with the aid of some facial embellishment, in this case a mustache that broadcasts the fanfare for the common man with all the discretion of Aaron Copland.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At 18 he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  DARGIS    'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelgänger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.  A. O. SCOTT    'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on-screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.  DARGIS    * 'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered to the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed by ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a 100-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.  DARGIS    'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (a k a Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.  DARGIS    'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Aquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their reveries and fantasies.  SCOTT    'A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG' Starring John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Shainee Gabel (R, 119 minutes). In this first feature directed by Ms. Gabel, Mr. Travolta delivers a hammed-up scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in ''Primary Colors.'' This is the story of a down-at-the-heels former star professor and his protégé rotting in the New Orleans house bequeathed them by a legendary folk-blues singer and their partial redemption when the singer's alienated daughter comes to live with them. The film dawdles along aimlessly for two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise. The movie's hokey solemnity suggests ''The Mundane Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood'' or ''The Notebook Goes to the Big Easy.'' The movie is another example of Hollywood going soft and squishy when it goes South.  HOLDEN    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).  DARGIS    * 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R; 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.  SCOTT    * 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in the enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick ''Ocean's Twelve,'' crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean -- played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack, Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan, and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.  DARGIS    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micromanaging phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-and-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.  SCOTT    'THE SEA INSIDE' Starring Javier Bardem and Belén Rueda. Directed by Alejandro Amenábar (PG-13, 125 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). As the camera restlessly circles the sky and the ocean, taking in the radiance of northern Spain, the story of a quadriplegic activist fighting for the right to die struggles to transcend the disease-of-the-week genre to which it belongs. Yet there is no escaping the fact that the true story of Ramón Sampedro, a former ship's mechanic seeking a final exit after three decades of agonizing immobility, is defined by its theme. To its credit it avoids becoming a formulaic dialogue that pits religious and secular cheerleaders against each other in predigested arguments. Sensitively portrayed by the great Spanish actor Javier Bardem, Ramón, 55, regards his life in the wake of a crippling accident in his mid-20's as a cruel, cosmic joke. In the emotional kernel of the movie, Ramón contemplates the impossibility of consummating his passion for his beautiful new lawyer (Ms. Rueda) who suffers from a debilitating disease.  HOLDEN    'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles, all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trench mate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F. A. O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose résumé hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror and, as in numerous Japanese and Korean titles, his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.  DARGIS    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Mos Def, Benjamin Bratt, David Alan Grier and Eve. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * AN ALBATROSS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Hardcore compression gets extreme in the fast, jolting songs of An Albatross, which are full of quick changes and shrieked vocals. But with two keyboards upfront instead of guitars, its gnashing riffs can veer toward a circus-like oom-pah or blippy electro, adding comedy to the frantic songs. Tomorrow night at 9, with Mitsuko, the Cinema Eye and Aqui opening; admission is $7.  JON PARELES    FROG HOLLER, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 683-6500. Frog Holler, from Berks County in Pennsylvania, plays roots-rock that leans toward the country side. It's equally at home with bluegrass picking or stately songs that echo the Band, full of feisty determination. It has just released a new album, ''The High, High's & the Low, Low's'' (ZoBird). Tonight at 10; admission is free.  PARELES    * THE GAME, Club Speeed, 20 West 39th Street, near Fifth Avenue, (212) 719-9867. Dr. Dre's newest protégé has a thunderous voice, an ever-present scowl and a desire to end L.A.'s hip-hop drought -- the city has produced surprisingly few rappers over the last decade. He is scheduled to appear at this long-running Sunday night party; expect to hear his thunderous current single, ''How We Do,'' and maybe some tracks from his highly anticipated debut album, ''The Documentary'' (Aftermath/Interscope), due out on Tuesday. Sunday night after 10; the first 500 women are to be admitted free; everyone else should expect to pay, though the price may depend upon when you show up.  KELEFA SANNEH    * INARA GEORGE, Zebulon Cafe, 258 Wythe Avenue near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934. Inara George's debut album, ''All Rise'' (Everloving), wil be released on Jan. 25. She doesn't sound like her father, Lowell George of Little Feat; she's more dreamy than bluesy, and her songs lean toward airy pop-folk, mixing surrealism with gentle barbs. 'If I was you, I wouldn't talk, I'd just keep dancing,' she sings. Tonight at 8; admission is free.  PARELES    GOLDEN FESTIVAL 2005, Hungarian House, 213 East 82nd Street and Good Shepherd School, 620 Isham Street, near 207th Street and Broadway, (718) 859-4759; goldenfestival.zlatneuste.org. Zlatne Uste (''Golden Lips'') is a brass band that plays the high-speed, zig-zagging Balkan dance tunes. It has organized a two-day festival of music from the Balkans and beyond, with dancers welcome. At the Hungarian House tonight at 7:30, it shares the bill with Anoush, playing music from the southern Balkans, and Beth Bahia Cohen and Friends, playing Pontic music from Greece. Tickets are $16, $12 for students and $5 for children 6 to 12; free under 6. Tomorrow from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. at the Good Shepherd School, the lineup includes Zlatne Uste and 30 other groups with music from Macedonia, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Romania, Greece, Persia, Norway and (with the Bosco Stompers Cajun Band) Louisiana. Tickets are $30, $20 for students, $8 for children 6 to 12; free under 6.  PARELES    * MERITA HALILI, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. Before moving to the United States, Merita Halili was one of Albania's best-known traditional singers, regularly performing on television and radio. Her voice is full of sweetness and strength, and her husband, Raif Hyseni, revs up the band with his accordion. Tomorrow night at 8. Tickets, $26; members and children, $22; students, $15.  PARELES    HAMELL ON TRIAL, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. A solo performer with the force of a hard-rock band, Ed Hamell quick-strums his acoustic guitar and delivers torrents of words, sometimes funny, sometimes furious. Tomorrow night, doors at 7; admission is $10.  PARELES    * KAOS, the Music Gallery, 49 Ann Street, 3rd Floor, Lower Manhattan, www.enablernetwork.org. Next month, this Berlin-based D.J. and producer is to release ''Hello Stranger'' (!K7), an album of danceable collaborations ranging from disco to post-punk; the songs don't always deliver, but the grooves rarely disappoint. He is to preside over a sweaty downtown dance party co-starring Daniel Wang (who appears on the album) and Cowboy Mark. Tonight after 10; admission is $7.  SANNEH    PADDY KEENAN, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Paddy Keenan, who plays uilleann pipes, comes from a family of itinerant Irish musicians, and has been one of Ireland's most influential tradtional players since he helped start the Bothy Band in the 1970's. The songwriter Patsy O'Brien shares the bill. Tonight at 7:30; admission is $18.  PARELES    BAKITHI KUMALO, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. The South African bassist Bakithi Kumalo was heard around the world playing bass on Paul Simon's ''Graceland''; he has his own musical fusions. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $12.  PARELES    JONNY LANG, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Jonny Lang started out as a blues guitar prodigy and has followed the path of early-1970's Eric Clapton. He reaches toward soul on his most recent album, ''Long Time Coming'' (A&M), letting guitar solos take over after he raises his voice to plead for love. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $47.50.  PARELES    YUNGCHEN LHAMO, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, Ext. 396. The sorrows and hopes of Tibet are in the voice of Yungchen Lhamo, who brings a sustained purity to her Buddhist devotional songs. Her albums give her music a new-age aura; on her own, she sounds even more vulnerable and resolute. Tonight at 7; admission is $15.  PARELES    LIL' MALCOLM AND THE HOUSE ROCKERS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. A zydeco band from Lake Charles, La., is a family that plays together, with Malcolm Walker on accordion, his father Percy on guitar and his brother, Percy Jr., on drums. Sunday at 1 p.m., with a dance workshop before the band starts; admission is $15.  PARELES    * MISSON OF BURMA, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. In the early 1980's Mission of Burma was one of the best American post-punk bands: burly and arty, dissonant and gruffly impassioned. Its reunion in 2002 didn't just set off a wave of indie-rock reunions; it restarted the band, which made an album, ''Onoffon'' (Matador) that still has the old crunch. Tonight and tomorrow at 9, with the Chinese Stars opening tonight and Damon and Naomi tomorrow night; tickets are $20.  PARELES    PALOMAR, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Whimsy and sinew co-exist nicely in the lean, peppy pop-rock of Palomar, a three-woman, one-man band whose songs jump from blithe choruses to wiry guitar patterns to hefty distortion, all at the service of the lyrics' articulate ambivalence. Tonight at 10:30, with the National at 11:30, Serious Weapon at 9:30 and Amy Miles at 8:30; admission is $10.  PARELES    * REGGAETON TEEN BASH 4, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (877) 246-8383. A party strictly for the kind of partygoers who usually get shut out: as the flyer says, ''under 19 to party.'' The headliner is Don Omar, one of the biggest stars in the booming Puerto Rico-based genre known as reggaeton; his infectious refrains make his sing-along ballads near as exciting as his frenetic club tracks. Sunday night after 9 with D.J. Camilo, who presides over the Sunday-night reggaeton show on Hot 97 (97.1 FM), as well as Da Original and DJ Precise; tickets are (or were) $25 in advance, more at the door.  SANNEH    * SUICIDE/THEE MAJESTY, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A singer (Alan Vega), a keyboardist (Martin Rev) and a relentlessly mechanical drum machine made up Suicide, the punk-era band that can now claim to be a pioneer of electronica and industrial rock. On its albums, just reissued, Suicide's songs are robotic updates of rockabilly, garage-rock and the Doors. It used to play its repetitive riffs until the audience rebelled; now, there's more tolerance and humor on both sides. Thee Majesty is the latest vehicle for the free-thinking manifestos of Genesis P-Orridge, formerly of Psychic TV and Throbbing Gristle and one of rock's most extreme self-experimenters. Tomorrow night at 10:30; tickets are $18 in advance, $20 tomorrow.  PARELES    * SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-7800. Gospel, blues, African rhythms, protest songs and the joys of harmony are the enduring touchstones of this group of a cappella women singers, who never forget to leaven righteousness with pleasure. This is a ''family concert,'' with children in mind. Sunday afternoon at 2; tickets are $8.  PARELES    CHRIS THILE AND EDGAR MEYER, Zankel Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Three-chord bluegrass songs no longer confine the music virtuoso pickers. Chris Thile, of Nickel Creek, and the bassist Edgar Meyer are part of what has been called 'new acoustic music,' and they can navigate all sorts of harmonic and rhythmic twists and turns. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $28 to $40.  PARELES    GLENN TILBROOK, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. As the tunesmith and the higher-voiced half of the songwriting team in Squeeze, Glenn Tilbrook collaborated on some of the most melodic and understatedly intelligent songs of the 1970's and 1980's, striving to live up to the example of the Beatles. Tonight at 7:30, with Ben Arthur opening; admission is $15.  PARELES    JUNIOR VASQUEZ, Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. This veteran D.J. is known for spinning marathon sets at the kinds of house-music parties that don't go out of their way to attract female revelers. On this Martin Luther King day weekend, he is to preside over one of Sunday night's latest celebrations -- so late, in fact, that it doesn't begin until 10 a.m. on Monday morning. Expect to hear the usual digitized disco and euphoric synthesizer lines, but don't be surprised if, at some point during his scheduled 10-hour set, Junior Vasquez also finds time to play thicker and darker rhythmic tracks; he knows the crowd will follow him wherever he roams. Monday morning -- yes, morning -- at 10; tickets are $30 in advance, more at the door.  SANNEH    ZEMOG EL GALLO BUENO, Zebulon Cafe, 258 Wythe Avenue near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934. Fierce salsa grooves launch daring free-jazz improvisations in Zemog el Gallo Bueno, a Boston Band that's equally fond of Tito Puente and Sun Ra. Tonight at 10; admission is free.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $40.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * BILL CHARLAP TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. The pianist Bill Charlap has a steady trio with Peter Washington and Kenny Washington; over the last five years or so his performances have become extraordinary displays of discipline and improvisation -- the wonders of an organized imagination. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is $10 minimum .  BEN RATLIFF    SCOTT COLLEY TRIO, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. A particularly in-demand bass player who has worked with Herbie Hancock, among others, Scott Colley has also led his own bands and made his own impressive records; in his band this weekend are two other major figures among young players, the saxophonist Chris Potter and the drummer Antonio Sanchez. Tonight and tomorrow at 10 pm; cover charge is $10.  RATLIFF    MARC COPLAND TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Starting out on saxophone, then changing to piano and growing considerably over the last two decades, Marc Copland has jazz discipline under his fingers but he gets into the music on a philosophical level, drawing all kinds of aesthetic inferences from film and painting and poetry. His trio includes the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Joachim Rueckert. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10, and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    * EDDIE HENDERSON QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)  864-6662. If you're looking for that quintessential New York jazz experience -- tough as nails yet harmonically stimulating, physical and intellectual at the same time -- you should try this group, one of the city's best undersung working bands, including the pianist Dave Kikoski, the bassist Ed Howard and the drummer Victor Lewis. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    * PAUL MOTIAN'S ELECTRIC BEBOP BAND, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. After 14 years, the group still seems totally fresh: two tenor saxophones, two guitarists, drums and electric bass, playing bebop repertory as well as Mr. Motian's own tunes. Known early on by his involvement in the early-60's Bill Evans trio, Mr. Motian, the drummer, now in his 70's, follows the path of surprise; constantly improvising, he phrases the rhythm differently in every single measure and leaves acres of open space in his sound. He's the real thing. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    ERIC REED HAPPINESS SEXTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 5th floor, Broadway at 60th Street; www.jalc.org. For this band, the pianist Eric Reed has written short, breezy suites; they suit his fluid, charmingly dexterous musical personality. He gets as much out of McCoy Tyner as any modern pianist, but he also reaches far and wide. Mr. Reed is drawn to fast tempos, and his music is always going somewhere, zeroing in on its target. The band includes the pianist Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonists Myron Walden and Seamus Blake, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Billy Drummond. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 o'clock set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    JOE SAMPLE TRIO, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. A member of the Crusaders, the long-running jazz-funk band of yesteryear, the pianist Joe Sample has gotten more traditional on a recent album, ''Soul Shadows'' (Verve), which includes solo-piano versions of songs by Joplin, Waller and Ellington. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge at the tables is eis $40, with a $5 minimum, $30 at the bar with a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    JIMMY SMITH QUINTET, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121.

Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $35 with a $10 minimum .  RATLIFF    VISION CLUB, Clemente Soto Velez Gallery, LES Gallery and Cafe,107 Suffolk at Rivington, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4080. The weekly omnium-gatherum of free-jazz players, presented by Arts for Art, who bring to you the annual Vision Festival; this one combines, in various different groupings, players including the saxophonists Daniel Carter and Joe McPhee, the trumpeter Ted Daniel, the guitarist Joe Morris and the bassist William Parker. Sets are tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9 and admission is $20 for both sets.  RATLIFF    RANDY WESTON AFRICAN RHYTHMS QUINTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. The pianist Randy Weston has a dynamic style: it leads him toward the extreme ends of the piano with a ringing percussiveness that's pure Ellington. But his ambitions have been larger than that ever since his first trips to Africa in the early 1960's. This weekend he presents his jazz band with African leanings. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; tickets, $30 tonight and tomorrow, $25 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances:  nytimes.com/music.    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA At the beginning of this new year the conductor Leon Botstein looks back exactly a century to 1905, a tumultuous time in Russian history, for his concert on Sunday afternoon with the American Symphony Orchestra. The program offers three works written in the immediate aftermath of that year: Stravinsky's ''Fireworks,'' Glazunov's ''Song of Destiny,'' and Miaskovsky's ''Silence: Symphonic Poem after E. A. Poe.'' Then Mr. Botstein conducts a Shostakovich work composed in 1957, which is also a look back to that time, the Symphony No. 11, titled ''The Year 1905.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. This weekend, the Damocles Trio displays its specialty in Spanish repertory. Tonight, Adam Kent, the trio's pianist, performs solo works by Albeniz, Falla, Rodrigo, Gerhard and others. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, Mr. Kent's colleagues join him for music by Turina, Valencia and Salvador Brotons. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35, $25 students.  JEREMY EICHLER    BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC ''Brooklyn Goes Hollywood'' begins the Brooklyn Philharmonic's season by celebrating the cultural meeting places, and sometimes clashes, between celebrated European musical immigrants, driven west by Hitler, and the salesmanship of the Hollywood movies studios. John Mauceri has made a specialty of the subject and offers Bernard Herrmann's music from two Hitchcock movies, Copland's suite from ''The Heiress,'' plus Gershwin's orchestral work for the film ''Shall We Dance'' and John Corigliano's music for ''Altered States.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 488-5913. Tickets: $20 to $60.  BERNARD HOLLAND    CARNEGIE HALL FESTIVAL CHORUS Carnegie's annual weeklong choral workshop, founded in 1990 by Robert Shaw, has pretty much stuck to the mold since Shaw's death in 1999, with orchestral cnductors picking up where the Shaw acolyte Norman Mackenzie leaves off in preparing the concluding concert. But this year the seasoned choral specialist Helmuth Rilling has settled in, undoubtedly with strong ideas of his own about how a chorus (this one larded with choral professionals from around the country) should be prepared. In fact, it's specialists all around: the work at hand is Mozart's unfinished C-minor Mass, in the premiere of a new completion by the Mozart authority Robert Levin. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $24 to $82.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    JULIA FISCHER Though the concerts by the Dresden Philharmonic this November at Avery Fisher Hall were wildly uneven, the 21-year-old German violinist Julia Fischer made a strong impression as the soloist in Brahms's Violin Concerto. Ms. Fischer is back for her New York recital debut at Zankel Hall tonight. If her program is very standard (Beethoven's ''Kreutzer'' Sonata, Schubert's Rondo in B minor, Bach's Solo Violin Sonata in C, and Prokofiev's Violin Sonata in D), it is certainly formidable. She will be joined by the Swiss-born pianist Oliver Schnyder. Tonight at 7:30, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $32.  TOMMASINI    JUILLIARD CHAMBERFEST There are free chamber music performances year-round at the Juilliard School, but the numbers swell during the annual chamber festival that has been taking place this week. In two final concerts this weekend, students will show off what they've learned in over 10 days of coaching from Juilliard faculty. Tonight features Schnittke's Piano Quintet, Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 3 and Brahms's Piano Quintet. Tomorrow night's program will be Brahms's Piano Quartet in A, Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in C minor and Schumann's Piano Quintet. Tonight at 8 in Alice Tully Hall, tomorrow at 8 in the Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406. Both are free, but tickets are required tonight.  EICHLER    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC There are tours (a couple of weeks, say, in Europe or Asia), and there are tours. Tonight, before it resumes its current subscription series, the orchestra makes the quickest of jaunts, to New Jersey, with Lorin Maazel conducting Beethoven's Seventh Symphony and Dvorak's ''New World.'' It returns tomorrow and on Tuesday with the subscription program, jointly conducted by Mr. Maazel and the orchestra's assistant conductor, Xian Zhang, who was a winner of the Maazel/Vilar Conductors' Competition in 2002. Mr. Maazel presents Strauss's Horn Concerto No. 1, with Philip Myers as soloist, and Mozart's Symphony No. 29. Ms. Zhang conducts Mark-Anthony Turnage's ''Scherzoid,'' a Philharmonic commission in its world premiere performances, and Britten's ''Four Sea Interludes'' from ''Peter Grimes.'' Tonight at 8, New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; tickets, $18 to $84. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.  OESTREICH    * PAUL O'DETTE The lute is an instrument that speaks softly but, in the right hands, can yield both delicate nuance and virtuosic fire. Paul O'Dette is one of its most sensitive and eloquent champions: among his dozens of superb recordings are incomparable performances of the great English Renaissance repertory, including the complete lute works of Dowland. For his concert in the Music Before 1800 series, though, he is setting aside the Renaissance lute and taking up the Baroque model, a larger, more robust instrument with a more expansive range and a repertory that includes the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Mr. O'Dette will Bach's ''Pièces pour la Luth à M. Schouster'' (BWV 995), the Partita in E (BWV 1006a) and the Sonata in G minor (BWV 1001), as well as a Suite in C minor by Bach's contemporary, Sylvius Leopold Weiss. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+.  ALLAN KOZINN    PARK AVENUE CHAMBER SYMPHONY If there's not a doctor in the house, there will be plenty of lawyers on the stage at this ensemble's winter concert, amateur in the best and oldest sense of the word, ''lovers'' of music. Investment bankers and government officials, executives and law clerks are the players in this five-year-old ensemble, which warms up for a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall next Wednesday with a concert that includes the Brahms Fourth as well as Gordon Jacob's Horn Concerto, written for the virtuoso Dennis Brain, performed here by a music therapist who happens to be an experienced soloist, Jennifer Miller. David Bernard, the group's founder, conducts. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, St. Jean Baptiste Church, Lexington Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 570-1200. Tickets: $15, $10 for 65+ and students.  ANNE MIDGETTE    CHRIS THILE AND EDGAR MEYER Highbrows frown on the ''crossover'' bent of the double-bass player Edgar Meyer, which is just plain silly: Mr. Meyer grew up in the bluegrass tradition, and any crossing over he's done has been mainly in the other direction, into classical music. Mr. Meyer has no problem acknowledging, or mingling, any of his musical roots: a respected artist member of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, he's also a star on the bluegrass circuit. Zankel Hall has, since its opening, deliberately sought to push the envelopes of musical definitions, and this weekend it plays host to Mr. Meyer with a frequent partner, the virtuoso mandolin player Chris Thile, in a program of original music. Some tongues will wag; many toes will tap. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $28 to $40.  MIDGETTE    TURTLE ISLAND AND YING STRING QUARTETS As the resident string quartet at Symphony Space the last few seasons, the Ying Quartet has presided an adventurous series called ''No Boundaries,'' in which newly commissioned works were offered alongside poetry, dance, video, folk music and other things, including a magic show and a demonstration of Chinese noodlemaking. Technically, the group's collaboration with the Turtle Island String Quartet isn't part of that series, but it is certainly in the same spirit. If the Yings specialize in the traditional and contemporary quartet repertory, the Turtle Island ensemble's performances range more freely, with distinct jazz and pop leanings. The two groups will perform together and on their own, in repertory that includes music by Mendelssohn and Milhaud (who both wrote exquisite string octets) and by members of the Turtle Island group. Tonight at 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $23 to $28.  KOZINN    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances:  nytimes.com/dance.    WALLY CARDONA QUARTET Mr. Cardona promises that his dancers will communicate anger, intimacy and loneliness in choreography that unfolds in a set made up of white cubes, strips of bright white floors, thin white panels and patches of synthetic grass. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25.  JENNIFER DUNNING    YANIRA CASTRO + COMPANY In Ms. Castro's new site-specific ''Beacon,'' an abandoned Brooklyn bathhouse serves as the setting for danced myth that doesn't quite measure up to its surroundings. Still, the interplay between live bodies and the images reflected on Roderick Murray's Plexiglass walls are magic enough. Tonight and tomorrow (and next Friday and Saturday) at 7 and 9 p.m.; Sunday (and next Sunday) at 6 p.m., Brooklyn Lyceum, 227 4th Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $20.  DUNNING    ISADORA DUNCAN DANCE FOUNDATION Lori Belilove and her dancers will present ''Dances of Inner Peace and Strength.'' The performers include child dancers known as the Beliloveables. 'Nuff said. Tonight at 8, New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 691-5040. Tickets: $40; $200 for a pair of tickets and a mini-Isadora Duncan kit. The kit includes: an educational booklet, a contemporary book by Peter Kurth; Isadora Speaks (a book on writing and speeches); a video called ''Spirit Unbroken''; a Isadora Duncan hand dyed silk scarf; a poster of the company and set of four postcards.)  DUNNING    VALERIE GREEN/DANCE ENTROPY In a program called ''Naked/Desire,'' Ms. Green will perform a new piece, ''Naked Heart,'' choreographed for her by Mariko Tanabe, on a program of dances by Ms. Green that fuse music, text and movement and that grew in part out of teaching residences in Bosnia and Albania. Tonight at 9; tomorow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (718) 436-0125. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    * KARINNE KEITHLEY The highly imaginative and decidedly unsolemn Ms. Keithley is presenting ''Tenderenda,'' which she describes as ''a sideways adaption'' of ''Tenderenda der Phantast,'' a 1919 Dada novel by Hugo Ball. It will be performed by three lead dancers and a living forest made up of eight additional dancers. ''Wooded Place,'' a solo performed by Ms. Keithley, will serve as a prologue. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, at Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET Tonight's program looks like a winner, beginning as it does with a bit of Balanchine (''La Source,'' danced by Miranda Weese, Benjamin Millepied and Ashley Bouder), the company director Peter Martins's celebration of guest dancer Julio Bocca in the new ''Todo Buenos Aires'' (repeated tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon) and Christopher Wheeldon's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' starring John Lithgow as narrator and featuring a delicious cameo performance by Kyra Nichols in a villain's role (repeated Sunday afternoon). Another highlight promises to be Mr. Wheeldon's absorbing ''Polyphonia'' on Saturday afternoon. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, Manhattan, (212) 870-5570 or www  .nycballet.com. Tickets: $30.- $83. For availability of student rush tickets at $12, check the Web site or call (212) 870-7766. (Related review, Page 2.)  DUNNING    SPINNIN' RONIN This intriguingly named troupe, which merges modern dance, ballet, theatrical movement, hip-hop and the martial arts, will present ''Born in the shadow, Die in the shadow (To be a flower . . . The tale of NINJA),'' a narrative suite of dances choreographed by Tsuyoshi Kaseda, Mayuna Shimizu and Kazuma G. Motomura. Yumi Kurosawa will provide a live performance of koto music. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 and 6:30 p.m., Dance Forum, 20 East 17th Street, Manhattan, (646) 379-3610. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    SUNDAYS AT THREE: IN HONOR OF MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY Ten dancers from the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company will perform their own work in a tribute to the civil rights martyr, part of an informal series that includes post-performance discussion with the artists. Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, at 92nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $10.  DUNNING    CASSIE TERMAN AND SHINICHI MOMO KOGA Ms. Terman, who worked for 14 years with Ruth Zaporah, and Mr. Koga, a Butoh dancer, filmmaker and director, will enter the empty stage and build an evening-long work from their first gestures in 'The Smallest Country: Duet Improvisation.' Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Center for Remembering and Sharing, 123 Fourth Avenue, Manhattan, (510) 915-3883. Tickets: $12.-15.  DUNNING    JULIE TOLENTINO Ms. Tolentino will perform ''For You,'' a free program of improvisations developed with Ori Flomin, but only for one audience member at a time. Appointments must be scheduled, for time slots through Jan. 23, with each caller specifying not only the time but music and viewing positions for this site-specific dance installation, which lasts 15 minutes. Those without appointments may watch a live video feed projected on another part of the performing space. Appointments may be made during gallery hours, Wednesday through Sunday, from noon to 7 p.m. Participant Inc., 95 Rivington Street between Ludlow and Orchard Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 254-4334.  DUNNING    ANTONIETTA VICARIO MAKES DANCES In ''hyperThermia,'' Ms. Vicario creates a movement installation performed in the round concerning five women's journey through Siberia. The work is presented in a bare space, and the dancers create their own accompaniment through whispers, breathing and hysterical noises. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8, Chez Bushwick, 304 Boerum Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, (718) 383-6409. Tickets: $10.  JACK ANDERSON    * LULA WASHINGTON DANCE COMPANY New Yorkers don't get many chances to see the work and company of this quietly innovative Los Angeles-based modern dance choreographer, whose blend of African and modern dance, ballet and performance art often expresses political and social commentary in the form of a folk tale, with humor and passion. Go for it. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $18; $9 for children 14 and younger.  DUNNING    * WORKS AND PROCESS: AMERICAN BALLET THEATER AND THE ART OF PARTNERING The company director, Kevin McKenzie, and its dancers will demonstrate and discuss the subtle, demanding art of classical ballet partnering. Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    'BLUE,' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through March 6. This cool, offbeat little show is made up of all-blue or mostly blue objects from the permanent collection, including, ceramics, quilts, Shaker ''gift drawings'' and some attractive portraits. In one dated around 1768, a proud young Newport, R.I., belle wears pricey pale blue silk. An 1830 watercolor of a boy named Frederick Buxton was done on the cheap. But while his blue suit has faded with time, his big, candid eyes are as blue as the day they were painted. They make a perfect conclusion to this chromatic take on American social history. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; students, 62+, $7.  COTTER    * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D.,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. Most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.  COTTER    JAMES GILLRAY, New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089, through Jan. 29. One of the most popular cartoonists of his day, Gillray (1756-1815) produced lively, hand-colored etchings that lampooned major public figures like the king, the queen and Napoleon, and many minor ones, too. At his best, Gillray's draftsmanly skill and visionary imagination puts him in a league with artists like William Blake, James Ensor and R. Crumb. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: Free.  KEN JOHNSON    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  JOHNSON    * 'RETRATOS: 2,000 YEARS OF LATIN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through March 20. Two millenniums is a lot of terrain for even a survey cover, and this one moves from pre-Columbian sculpture to contemporary painting. It starts with a 16th-century portrait of three dark-skinned men, descendants of Indians and African slaves, wearing European ruffed collars, silks and distinctly un-European gold lip-rings and nose plugs and continues with images of bewigged colonial officials, flower-crowned nuns, and everyday people. Together they distill the essence of a multicultural continent, and of a society built on minutely calibrated hierarchies of race and class. Hours: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5, students and 65+; free for members; Thursdays free from 4 to 8 p.m.; 65+ free all day Thursdays.  COTTER    * 'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. Hmmm. Hours and admission: see above.  GRACE GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    ROSWELL ANGIER, Gitterman, 170 East 75th Street, (212) 734-0868, through Jan. 29. In the early 1970's, this photographer explored a Boston netherworld called the Combat Zone where strip joints and other sex-related businesses flourished. His documentary pictures of strippers and pimps are not sensational but matter-of-fact, tender and sad. A more recent series studying street and bar life in Native American border towns in the Southwest is similarly humane and visually poetic.  JOHNSON    MILTON AVERY: 'ONRUSHING WAVES,' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 29. The sea was always a painterly challenge for Avery (1885-1965) who saw it as a landscape of forms in endless free motion. This show of his seascapes from the 1920's through the 50's includes paintings, watercolors and a selection of his sketchbooks recording trips to seaworthy places. The best of the canvases here are the later ones, larger and much closer to abstraction, done in Provincetown summers. ''Onrushing Wave,'' which gives the show its title, is a white field stroked with horizontal dashes of off-blue; in the foreground is a mountainous white crest that confronts the viewer head on, vertically striated with the same blue. At the painting's bottom, rows of tiny blue ripples giver whispering echo to the upheaval above them. These works stay fresh no matter how often you've seen them.  GLUECK    'PAESAGGIO: ITALIAN LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY,' Keith De Lellis Gallery, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482, through Feb. 12. After World War II, as Italian filmmakers were making the neo-Realist masterpieces that became classic Italian cinema, still photographers hungrily trained their lenses on the landscape, recording countryside and cities as they recovered from the devastation of Facism and war. The 48 images in this show, mostly from the 1950's and 60's, are the work of 16 photographers, in modes from traditional to far out. Mario Giacommelli shoots abstract patterns made by farmed and tilled earth; much more in the romantic tradition is Antonio Amaduzzi's lyrical landscape involving a lone tree, a puffy white cloud and a line of grassy earth, invaded by the tiny figures of an embracing couple leaning against the trunk.  GLUECK    Galleries: 57th Street    JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Jan. 29. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    SU-MEI TSE, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Jan. 22. This exhibition features the work that won the prize for best national pavilion -- Luxembourg's -- at the 2003 Venice Bienale. It consists of a white neon sign that reads ''[E:r] conditionné,'' and two dreamlike video projections. In one, the artist plays the cello on a grassy, alpine prominence; in the other, men in green janitorial uniforms in a desert use green-bristled brooms to sweep sand into small piles.  JOHNSON    * 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown.  COTTER    Galleries: Chelsea    ROZ CHAST: 'SEASON'S GREETINGS,' Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410. through Jan. 29. For her first New York gallery exhibition, this brilliant cartoonist presents recent cartoons, many of which have appeared in The New Yorker, and a set of eggs brightly painted according to a traditional Ukrainian craft. The eggs bearing images of funny-looking people are amusing, but they don't compete with the cartoons' hilarious and uncannily acute take on the conflicted psychic life of ordinary, white, liberal Americans.  JOHNSON    'CONSTRUCTED IMAGE,' Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 627-3680, through Jan. 29. Though not quite convincing as a theme show, this 15-artist exhibition presents some compelling works, including a small, extraordinarily life-like bronze head with glass eyes by Elizabeth King; a haunting Pop-surrealist painting of an old boxer by Llyn Foulkes; a large collage portrait of a woman made of neatly inlaid pieces of road maps by Matthew Cusick and a bizarrely erudite, diagrammatic painting about the Grand Guignol Theater by Paul Laffoley.  JOHNSON    'THE FURNITURE OF POUL KJAERHOLM AND SELECTED ART WORK,' Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181; R 20th Century, 82 Franklin Street, (212) 343-7979, through Jan. 29. The market-accelerated convergence of art and design proceeds apace with this two-gallery exhibition of severely elegant, Modernist furniture by the Danish designer Poul Kjaerholm (1929-1980) with works by 19 contemporary artists from John Baldessari to Richard Tuttle providing background aesthetic resonance. Many of Kjaerholm's works look like anonymous airport furnishings, but the best have a finely detailed grace.  JOHNSON    KEITH HARING, Alona Kagan, 540 West 29th Street, (212) 560-0670, through Jan. 29. If you liked the New Museum's lively survey of the East Village scene of the 1980's, you will appreciate this selection of paintings and sculptures by one of the best artists to emerge from that cauldron of antic creativity. It includes subway drawings in chalk on black paper; large, dizzyingly patterned canvases and brightly enameled, cut-metal characters. Barking dogs, radiant babies, flying saucers, mythic monsters and all kinds of hyperactive humans animate Haring's delirious cosmic comedy.  JOHNSON    'ED RUSCHA, ROBERT FRANK, WALKER EVANS,' Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-9610, through Jan. 29. A fine synergy is generated by this selection of pictures by photographers from three distinct generations. All share an understated, sometimes ironic, sometimes mordantly romantic love for vernacular American culture of the street and the open road. The show includes late Polaroid shots of commercial and traffic signs by Evans; examples from Mr. Frank's beatnik-era masterpiece ''The Americans'' and aerial views of parking lots by Mr. Ruscha.  JOHNSON    FRATELLI TOSO, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 22. Fratelli Toso was a Murano glass-making factory in Venice that operated from 1823 to 1979. This beautiful show presents bottles, vases and bowls made in the murrine technique in which round slices of multi-colored glass canes are melded together before the final shape is blown. The woozy, richly colorful and intensely detailed floral and starburst patterns are riveting to look at and each object is a marvel of luxurious sensuousness. Visual hedonists take note.  JOHNSON    THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Feb. 5. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    FRANZ ACKERMANN, 'NONSTOP WITH HHC,' Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, through Jan. 22. This Berlin-based painter who was shortlisted for the 2004 Hugo Boss Prize, has produced a characteristically enveloping, high-energy environment of mural painting and variously sized canvases and works on paper centered around a giant, free-standing, Pop-Cubist style painting apparently representing a crashed airplane. Altogether it makes for a lively but grandiose commentary on the thrills and terrors of globalized modernity.  JOHNSON    * A. BALASUBRAMANIAM, Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, through Jan 22. The work of this exceptional young artist, based in India, is about the play of material solidity and illusion. His first show at Talwar two years ago included a full-size human form that seemed to pass through a gallery wall; for the current show he has cast his own head in an opaque, waxy substance of a kind used to produce air fresheners, so that the self-portrait will dissolve through slow evaporation. Time and change are also the subjects of other work here. And the whole, spare, resonant show comes together in a sculpture of a single slender branch bristling with sharp thorns and cast in solid gold; the more alluring illusion is, the more be painful it can be.  COTTER    'FIGHT OR FLIGHT,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through Feb. 18. Six artists were asked to make works about fear and anxiety. Excepting Rico Gatson's kaleidoscopic video punctuated by exploding bombs, none directly address war or terrorism. Amy Gartrell's psychedelic felt banners spoof self-affirmation mantras, Kristin Baker's semiabstract paintings evoke car crashes and Marc Swanson's ship mast with a square sail of stitched-together T-shirts encourages a spirit of adventure. Little carnivorous horses graze on the flesh of a fallen dragon in Ivan Witenstein's large fantasy sculpture and an installation by Wangechi Mutu stages a surrealistic shootout.  JOHNSON    'NYC,' DFN Gallery, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 334-3400, through Jan. 29. This selection of New York City-scapes by more than 40 painters is uneven but has many good things, including: a picture of the Columbia University green from 1975 by Rackstraw Downes; a small, Whistleresque study of office building windows by Alex Katz; a dreamy vision of a Cony Island roller coaster by David Levine; and a finely detailed, overhead picture of an intersection painted in egg tempera by Douglas Safranek with the tender exactitude of an early Renaissance master.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    'ART IN A MIRROR: COUNTERPROOFS OF MARY CASSATT,' Adelson Galleries, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 439-6800, closing today. These recently discovered counterproofs would seem to be of more interest to Cassatt scholars than to the general public. Like some of her Impressionist colleagues, notably Degas, Cassatt (1844-1926) made them by the simple method of pressing a damp sheet of paper on the face of existing work -- here, pastels -- transferring a mirror image of the original, but faded and softened. The 48 shown, sweet portraits of mothers with infants, children alone or posing with pets, and an occasional less treacly one, pale by comparison with the sharp chromatics of Cassatt's wonderful prints.  GLUECK    RICHARD JACKSON: 'DICK'S PICTURES,' Haswellediger, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 206-8955, through tomorrow. 'THE THREE BEARS,' Foundation 20 21, 15 Gamercy Park, (212) 473-4447, through Jan. 22. A California-based neo-Dadaist, Mr. Jackson constructs absurd painting machines. A paint-spattered room at Haswellediger is the result of a performance in which the artist poured paint in through a window while the motor-driven floor of the room revolved. Also on view is a grotesquely altered deer decoy for hunters into which Mr. Jackson pumped differently colored paints. A third sculpture at Foundation 20 21 consists of three similarly abused bear decoys.  JOHNSON    ROGER BROWN, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338, closing tomorrow. Roger Brown (1941-1997) was one of the most original artists to emerge from Chicago after World War II. He blended influences from Indian miniature painting, Giorgio DiChirico, Grant Wood, outsider art and old comics to create mysteriously enchanting landscapes and cityscapes populated by tiny, silhouetted people. The nine canvases dating from 1968 to 1982 on view here are the first Brown exhibition to be presented in New York in 10 years.  JOHNSON    AMY ELLINGSON: 'SEMPER AUGUSTUS,' Charles Cowles, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-8999, closing tomorrow. This California-based artist's first New York solo show presents paintings that are optically enthralling and sensuously tactile. Ms. Ellingson generates complex, layered patterns of gridded ovals on a computer, and converts them into satiny, subtly color-coordinated oil-painted fields, on top of which she applies grids of thick, white or black ovals made in encaustic.  JOHNSON    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, closing on Sunday. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. This show, presenting about 40 works, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. One chillingly stylized canvas, ''Lady Warwick and Her Son'' (1905), is almost a parody of the Grand Manner style perfected by Sir Joshua Reynolds and company. It shows the regal, elegantly gowned aristocrat in a fakey forest setting with her too-pretty, overdressed small son seated on the base of a marble column. Hours and admission: see above.  GLUECK    'MATERIAL AS METAPHOR,' Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, closing tomorrow. An exhibition of works that are emphatically physical yet poetic includes comically anthropomorphic sculptures by Miroslaw Balka; a darkly surrealistic sculptural landscape by Mark Manders; an arrangement of mostly yellow found and hand-made objects by Ian Kiaer; roses wrapped in spirals of puffy white cotton by Valeska Soares; elegantly spare fabric works by Helen Mirra; and lumps of fat in a cardboard box by Joseph Beuys.  JOHNSON    'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, closing on Sunday. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. Cut mostly from thin slabs of marble or wood, the cleverly joined parts are notched to fit into each other without benefit of glue, nails or other fixatives. They form a quintessentially Noguchi synthesis of the human and totemic. A small gallery displays the quirky abstract sculptures he called ''Lunars'' that, rigged out with light bulbs in odd places, made lamps of a fine, goofy sci-fi quality that must have seemed off the wall in 1943. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, solar discs in stone; low-lying carved stone landscapes, and the sleek ''Bow'' of 1970, an elegantly bent tube composed of alternate bands of black granite and yellow marble Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.  GLUECK    JENNIFER PASTOR: 'THE PERFECT RIDE,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, closing on Sunday. ''The Perfect Ride'' is a trio of works displayed in the Whitney's small first-floor gallery: a three-minute, slow-motion animated cartoon of a cowboy riding a bucking bull; a model of the human ear; and a large, semiabstract sculpture of aluminum and clear plastic that represents Hoover Dam. All three involved the flow and circulation of energy, but beyond that it is hard to say what Ms. Pastor has in mind with this exceedingly cool and cerebral exhibition. Hours and admission: see above.  JOHNSON    'GILBERT STUART,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closing on Sunday. Known today mostly for his multiple images of George Washington, 14 of which are shown here, Stuart (1755-1828) painted many other faces, famous and not, as seen in this full-blown retrospective. Among them were Thomas Jefferson; John and Abigail Adams; the fur magnate John Jacob Astor; John Jay, first chief justice of the United States; the painters Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley; and doctors, lawyers, clergymen and countless British and American blueboods, their wives, children and dogs. The last Stuart retrospective was held nearly 40 years ago; this one reveals for a new generation that he was and remains one of our greatest American painters. Hours and admission: see above.

It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. This week, performances have been added on Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BEN BRANTLEY    * 'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. This week, a performance will be added on Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.  BRANTLEY    ++ ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother.'' Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'PACIFIC OVERTURES.' The director Amon Miyamoto dazzled New Yorkers at the Lincoln Center Festival two years ago with his visiting Japanese-language production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's 1976 musical about American gunboat diplomacy as visited on 19th-century Japan. Now Mr. Miyamoto has revisited the show with an English-speaking, predominantly Asian-American cast, including B. D. Wong as the wryly omniscient narrator. The show's scenic and conceptual elements are essentially the same. including the amusing representation of Commodore Perry as a feral barbarian. But something has definitely been lost in the retranslation. The production does give beguiling due to Mr. Sondheim's silken, silvery score. with orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. But an uneasy tentativeness pervades the stage like a mist of perspiration (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'THE RIVALS' Here she is at last! Dear old Mrs. Malaprop! The delightful Mrs. M, who, with a disdainful nod to Richard Brinsley Sheridan, misspoke her way to immortality in the pages of the Oxford English Dictionary. You know the word, you've probably made the mistake, and now, courtesy of the new Broadway revival of ''The Rivals,'' Sheridan's celebrated 1775 comedy of manners, you can finally make the acquaintance of the famous dame who generously bequeathed her name to a linguistic error. As personified by Dana Ivey, an actress of blissfully well-honed comic instincts, Mrs. Malaprop is indeed the main event in Mark Lamos's plumply upholstered production. But despite a largely zesty cast and a first-class production, the uncomfortable truth is Sheridan's comedy is one of those approved-and-certified classics that require unexpected reserves of patience and fortitude. Intermittently adorable, it is also, and not infrequently, tedious (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $85; $75 to $100 on Friday.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    '700 SUNDAYS.' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200 Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. This week, performances will be added on Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.  BRANTLEY    *++ 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she has met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. This movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49 Ms. Goldberg is an established performer and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25.  ISHERWOOD    Off Broadway    ++ 'THE BALTIMORE WALTZ.' Paula Vogel is indisputably the author of ''The Baltimore Waltz,'' but a decade of collective grief, rage and confusion surely played a part in its authorship, too. Ms. Vogel began work on the play shortly after her brother's death from AIDS in 1988. It was a deeply personal, even idiosyncratic expression of sorrow and love. But in the dozen years since its premiere at Circle Repertory, emotion surrounding the AIDS epidemic has inevitably cooled, and the play now must stand up to less emotionally inflected scrutiny. Sadly, on the evidence of Mark Brokaw's smart but dry production, the second in the Signature Theater's season devoted to Ms. Vogel's work, it mostly sags. This is partly due to a crucial piece of miscasting. Kristen Johnston is a talented actress, but she doesn't do poignancy convincingly. She makes all the right noises, but the submerged emotional charge that should bind the jumbled gambits of Ms. Vogel's comedy never fully emerges (1:25). Signature's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    ++ 'BELLE ÉPOQUE.' The époque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle Époque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $70.  ISHERWOOD    *++ 'DOUBT, A PARABLE.' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. (Think ''The Children's Hour'' crossed with ''Agnes of God.'') But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    'FAT PIG.' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. This week, a performance has been added on Wednesday at 8:15 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    'THE FOREIGNER.' Matthew Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There is no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. Directed by Scott Schwartz, the production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  ISHERWOOD    ++ 'MODERN ORTHODOX' It is said that God works in mysterious ways. Daniel Goldfarb's new play suggests that the Lord is not above employing obnoxious ones, too. In this snappy if superficial romantic comedy with a glossy cast (Molly Ringwald, Jason Biggs and Craig Bierko), Hannah and Ben, a young Jewish couple comfortably ensconced on Manhattan's Upper West Side, are provoked to question their commitment to each other -- and the depth of their religious feeling -- when Hershel Klein, an ill-mannered interloper from another borough and another sect, arrives on their doorstep demanding to be given harbor. Since the abrasive behavior of Hershel, played by Mr. Biggs, tends to indicate colossal bad manners more powerfully than spiritual enlightenment, the character's deployment as a catalyst is more than a little specious. But the soul-searching is primarily filler supplementing Mr. Goldfarb's bright comic swipes at intrafaith cultural clashes (1:30). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. This week, a performance has been added on Sunday at 7 p.m. Tickets: $46 to $66.  ISHERWOOD    * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at box office one hour before the show.  ISHERWOOD    * 'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Sam Shepard (yep, that one) and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. This week, a performance has been added on Friday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    ++ 'BOMBAY DREAMS' Colors don't come any juicier than those that saturate this $14 million musical about movie love, Bollywood-style. Scarcely a scene goes by that isn't splashed with gorgeous heaping helpings of oranges, golds, greens, purples, yellows and more shades of pink than even Estée Lauder had names for. Yet such is the perverse spell cast by this friendly, flat and finally unengaging tale of glamorous movie stars and lovable untouchables that everything seems to melt into one neutral blur before your eyes, like a monochromatic symphony in the key of beige. A R Rahman's score has a certain rhythmic infectiousness. But under the direction of Steven Pimlott, this retooling of a hit from London feels trapped in a listless limbo between tipsy spoof and sober sincerity (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $101.25.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'DRACULA, THE MUSICAL' And here it is, looming like a giant stuffed bat on a stick, the easiest target on Broadway. This show, which sets the familiar tale of old snaggletooth to the familiar music of Frank Wildhorn, bristles with all the animation, suspense and sex appeal of a Victorian waxworks in a seaside amusement park. Take your shots. Say something, if you must, about toothlessness or bloodlessness or the kindness of hammering stakes into the hearts of undead shows. But you may concede that it isn't much fun to trash something so eminently trashable. ''Dracula, the Musical,'' which features a book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton and is directed by Des McAnuff, isn't simply bad, which is an aesthetic state of being that is kind of fun if you're in the right mood. It is bad and boring. Among the talents wasted here are Melissa Errico and, looking like a butler's butler in the title role, Tom Hewitt (2:10). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Today at 2 p.m.; tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25.  BRANTLEY    + 'GOLDA'S BALCONY' In October 1973 a 75-year-old woman who grew up in Milwaukee nearly started a nuclear holocaust. The woman, of course, was the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir; the occasion was the 1973 Middle East War. As a story, it needs very little help from a dramatist or, for that matter, from a director, a designer, an actor or any other theatrically creative type. Moreover, the elements of the pure narrative are so colossally charged with tension and consequence that understatement is the way to go. ''Golda's Balcony'' doesn't go that way, however. It is not the story of a crucial moment in world history but a ponderous essay wrapped in melodramatic autobiography, acted with a soulless verve by Tovah Feldshuh and presented in a cheesily overwrought production directed by Scott Schwartz (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. tomorrow at 5 and 8:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 and $86.25; a limited number of student rush tickets are available on the day of the performance for $26.25.  BRUCE WEBER    ++ 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 7 p.m.; tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m.; Monday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25.  ISHERWOOD    ++ 'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver, with more than 50 years on the stage, gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogy. The actor also allows the audience to take note of the declining powers of a once-powerful intellect. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25.  ISHERWOOD    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    * 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael García Bernal, Fele Martínez and Javier Cámara. Directed by Pedro Almodóvar (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). This Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless filmmakers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almodóvar, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grâce of ''Bad Education'' is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelgänger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams and line their pocketbooks.  HOLDEN    'BLADE: TRINITY' Starring Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson and Jessica Biel. Directed by David S. Goyer (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Snipes may have achieved the Hollywood dream of starring in a comic-book franchise that doesn't require real acting, but he doesn't seem to appreciate his good fortune in the disjointed, overlong ''Blade: Trinity,'' which bills itself as the series finale. The ''Blade'' movies demand only that the 42-year-old actor stay pumped up and ready for kung-fu action. But the only emotion his character, a glowering half-human, half-vampire hunter of the undead, can muster in the third installment is a sense of mild irritation at having to go through the hassle. This episode is a choppy, forgetful, suspense-free romp that substitutes campy humor for chills.  HOLDEN    'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy. The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community.  HOLDEN    'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on-screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. ''Peter Pan'' has been revisited numerous times. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. The film mainly concerns the period when Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote.  DARGIS    'FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX' Starring Dennis Quaid, Tyrese Gibson and Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by John Moore (PG-13, 115 minutes). The moth-eaten plane-crash-in-the-desert yarn, a cynical update of the far superior 1965 movie, directed by Robert Aldrich and starring James Stewart and Richard Attenborough, throws in every cheap trick in the manual to pump up your heartbeat. Watching it is the equivalent of having the soles your feet tickled; you react, but involuntarily. The setting has been moved from the Sahara to the Gobi Desert and the revamped characters make up a cunningly chosen and unlikely mosaic of types that include a pretty woman, a one-eyed African-American guitarist, a Mexican-American chef and a Saudi. Mr. Quaid is the brawny, hard-bitten pilot and Mr. Ribisi the brainy airplane designer who, against all odds, supervises the reconstruction of the downed plane into an aeronautical phoenix.  HOLDEN    * 'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered to the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed by ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a 100-day bloodbath in 1994, offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel Des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    * 'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS' Starring Zhang Ziyi. Directed by Zhang Yimou (PG-13, 119 minutes; in Mandarin, with English subtitles). In the latest chapter of Mr. Zhang's triumphant reinvention as an action filmmaker, Ms. Zhang plays Mei, a blind courtesan who turns out to be a member of the Flying Daggers, a shadowy squad of assassins waging a guerrilla insurgency against the corrupt and decadent government. She is pursued by two government deputies, Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), whose loyalties come into question as the chase turns into a love triangle. Everyone is engaged in several layers of deceit, and some of the third-act revelations are more likely to provoke laughter than gasps of amazement. But realism is as irrelevant a criterion here as it would be in an Italian opera. The movie is about color, kineticism and the kind of heavy-breathing, decorous sensuality that went out of American movies when sexual candor came in. Though it is in constant, breathtaking motion, the picture is not especially moving. Unlike the greatest operas (in whatever medium), it inspires you to gasp, but not to weep.  A. O. SCOTT    * 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes tries to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced superheroes into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Mr. Bird uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world in which ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology.  SCOTT    'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (a k a Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.  DARGIS    'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Aquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their reveries and fantasies.  SCOTT    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).  DARGIS    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.  SCOTT    'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year-old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine.  HOLDEN    * 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in the enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick ''Ocean's Twelve,'' crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean -- played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack, Mr. Pitt plays his second-in-command, Rusty Ryan, and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.  DARGIS    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micromanaging phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-and-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.  SCOTT    'THE POLAR EXPRESS' With the voices of Tom Hanks, Michael Jeter, Peter Scolare, Nona Gaye, Eddie Deezen and Charles Fleischer. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (G, 97 minutes). Based on the 32-page children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, this new animated feature has received attention for the advanced technology used to make the film and the heart-skipping amount of money reportedly spent to transpose the story from page to screen. I suspect that most moviegoers care more about stories and characters than how much money it took for a digitally rendered strand of hair to flutter persuasively in the wind. Nor will they care that to make ''Polar Express'' Mr. Hanks wore a little cap that transmitted a record of his movements to a computer, creating templates for five animated characters. It's likely, I imagine, that most moviegoers will be more concerned by the eerie listlessness of those characters' faces and the grim vision of Santa Claus's North Pole compound.  DARGIS    * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out.  SCOTT    'THE SEA INSIDE' Starring Javier Bardem and Belén Rueda. Directed by Alejandro Amenábar (PG-13, 125 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). As the camera restlessly circles the sky and the ocean, taking in the radiance of northern Spain, the story of a quadriplegic activist fighting for the right to die, struggles to transcend the disease-of-the-week genre to which it belongs. Yet there is no escaping the fact that the true story of Ramón Sampedro, a former ship's mechanic seeking a final exit after three decades of agonizing immobility, is defined by its theme. To its credit it avoids becoming a formulaic dialogue that pits religious and secular cheerleaders against each other in predigested arguments. Sensitively portrayed by the great Spanish actor Javier Bardem, Ramón, 55, regards his life in the wake of a crippling accident in his mid-20's as a cruel, cosmic joke. In the emotional kernel of the movie, Ramón contemplates the impossibility of consummating his passion for his beautiful new lawyer (Ms. Rueda) who suffers from a debilitating disease.  HOLDEN    'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles, all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.  SCOTT    'THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE' With the voices of Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and Rodger Bumpass. Directed by Steven Hillenburg (PG, 88 minutes). If nautical nonsense is something you wish for, then this big-screen expansion of the popular Nickelodeon show will be just the ticket. SpongeBob and his best pal Patrick set off on a rambling quest to recover a stolen crown and prevent Plankton from taking over Bikini Bottom and driving poor Mr. Krabs out of business. If none of this makes sense to you, fear not; it won't necessarily make any more after the movie is done. In any case, the point of ''SpongeBob'' is not sense but nonsense, and the film, like the series, is a giddy celebration of pure childishness, which makes it a refreshing antidote to the glowering machismo that dominates so much pop culture.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F. A. O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Rock/Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop music concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend, including special New Year's Eve celebrations tonight. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

What was once called shoegazer rock -- shimmering, multilayered guitars enfolding confessions of longing and ambiguity -- is back in Asobi Seksu, a New York band that wraps its guitars and keyboard around well-made pop melodies and the girlish ache of Yuki Chikudate's voice. Tonight at 8, topping a bill with Other Passengers, the Winter Pageant, Levy, Sylophone and Autodrone. Admission is $20, with a Champagne toast at midnight.  JON PARELES    BLACK 47, Connolly's Pub, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 597-5126.

PARELES    DISCO BISCUITS, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740. The Disco Biscuits have worked their way up the jam-band circuit with blithe rock that veers toward funk and jazz, hovers in circling, hypnotic riffs and sometimes turns into a live version of electronic dance music, replacing computer drumbeats with muscle. Tonight at 9; tickets are $45.  PARELES    DJ SPOOKY, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com. Paul Miller, also known as DJ Spooky, spins theories along with discs, and his collection runs to Stockhausen and Coltrane as well as breakbeats; whether he'll be ambient, uptempo or both is anyone's guess. He'll be joined by guests including the rapper Dalek. Tonight at 9; admission is $30.  PARELES    * DRIVE-BY TRUCKERS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Drive-By Truckers treat Southern rock as both music and mythos, reaching back to the Americana of the Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Neil Young. Their latest album, ''The Dirty South'' (New West), finds populist connections among Wal-Mart workers, musicians, moonshiners and drug dealers, all struggling to get by. Tonight at 1 a.m.; tickets are $35. Also appearing tomorrow at 9 p.m., with the garage-psychedelic trio Runner and the Thermodynamics opening; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 tomorrow.  PARELES    STEVE FORBERT, Joe's Pub, 425 Layfayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778. Steve Forbert, from Meridian, Miss., has outgrown the new-Dylan comparisons he drew in the late 1970's. Persevering through the years, he has turned into a winsome, determinedly optimistic folk-rock songwriter with more mileage on his voice and in his lyrics. Tomorrow and Sunday nights at 7; admission is $22 with a $12 food or drink minimum at a table.  PARELES    FORT BRAGG, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500. A country band of Texans transplanted to New York City, Fort Bragg looks toward Austin, Nashville and Bakersfield, Calif., to sing about whiskey, the road and woman trouble. Tonight, the first set begins at 10; admission is free.  PARELES    GOGOL BORDELLO, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. Gogol Bordello, led by a gruff and extravagantly mustached Ukrainian singer, Eugene Hutz, calls itself a Gypsy punk band. Translating Eastern European cabaret to Brooklyn, Its songs work up to a frenetic oom-pah that's the makings of a rowdy party. Tonight at 9; tickets are $35.  PARELES    TIM GOLDSWORTHY, APT, 419 West 13th Street, (212) 414-4245. Tim Goldsworthy is a partner in the production team and label DFA and also the man behind the electronica group Unkle, reaching back to the funk-punk-electro hybrids of the early 1980's. He's doing a rare disc-jockey set for New Year's Eve, along with Tim Sweeney, Duane Harriott, Dante Cafargna and others. Tonight from 10; admission is $100, including an open bar from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., hors d'ouevres and a Champagne toast.  PARELES    * GOV'T MULE, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. Warren Haynes, the guitarist and leader of Gov't Mule, is now a member of both the Allman Brothers Band and the Dead. With Gov't Mule, he brings the gravity of the blues and the rolling grooves of Southern rock together with the bleary determination of grunge. His songs are haunted by death and memory, and he leads them into jams that can be both soaring and unsparing. Tonight at 9; tickets are $53.50 to $73.50.  PARELES    GARLAND JEFFREYS AND THE CONEY ISLAND PLAYBOYS WITH MICK JONES, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. The songwriter Garland Jeffreys is a longtime voice of multiethnic New York, mixing rock, reggae and touches of everything from doo-wop to samba. Along with love songs and reminiscences of running ''Wild in the Streets,'' he doesn't flinch from tough topics like racism. Tonight at 8; tickets are $65, with a two-drink minimum.  PARELES    HANK-O-RAMA, Arlene's Grocery, 95 Stanton Street at Ludlow Street (212) 358-1633. Hank Williams's songs are still a foundation of country music, even though they're considerably more stark than their latter-day successors. Local country bands including the Lonesome Prairie Dogs, the American String Conspiracy, Sean Kershaw and the New Jack Ramblers, the Blue State Band and Alex Battle's Whiskey Rebellion delve into the repertory. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $7.  PARELES    EARTHA KITT, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, near Times Square, (212) 997-4144. She purrs, she growls, she teases and she rasps as she insinuates exactly what she wants from her man. Although it's a week late, she might still sing ''Santa Baby.'' Tonight at 8; tickets are $125, including dinner and a glass of Champagne, and $50 for general-admission seats plus a $10 food or drink minimum with a complimentary glass of Champagne. At the 10:30 p.m. set, tickets are $150, including dinner and a glass of Champagne. General admission is $75 with a $10 food or drink minimum, which includes a free glass of Champagne.  PARELES    AMEL LARRIEUX, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Amel Larrieux, who used to sing with Groove Theory, is a high-minded pop-soul songwriter, singing about ambition and integrity. On albums, she floats her supple, girlish voice among twinkling starscapes of electric piano and phantom choruses of herself overdubbed; live, she's likely to be less ethereal. Tonight at 8:30, with Eric Roberson opening; admission is $95 with dinner, $45 for standing room.  PARELES    FRANK LONDON'S KLEZMER BRASS ALL-STARS/SCOTT KETTNER'S MARACATU NEW YORK, the Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Party music from two continents: the oom-pah of klezmer in a band led by the trumpeter Frank London, and the Brazilian carnival beat of maracatu from Maracatu New York. Tonight at 8; admission is $15.  PARELES    JESSE MALIN, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, at 11th Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Jesse Malin led D Generation, the glam-rock kings of St. Mark's Place, and has gone on to a solo career that's considerably more earnest. Tonight at 10; tickets are $35, including a buffet and a Champagne toast.  PARELES    PARTICLE/BUCKETHEAD, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. Particle is a jam band rooted in funk whose marathon sets might include a jam on ''Planet Rock,'' a long meditation on a single sustained chord, or a gospelly, organ-driven buildup fit for the Allman Brothers. Sharing the bill is the guitarist Buckethead, who hides his face behind a fried-chicken bucket and plays zooming, cutting hard-rock guitar leads that earned him a spot in Guns N' Roses. Tonight at 9; tickets are $45.  PARELES    * MIKE PATTON AND JOHN ZORN, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The singer Mike Patton has countless voices, from yowl to cackle to heroic and mock-heroic rock belting; the saxophonist and composer John Zorn loves both melodies and goofy noises. They have worked together in the band Mr. Bungle, and they're capable of both tightly plotted works and wildly spontaneous improvisations. Tonight at 8; admission is $30. Tonight at 11, the band Trans Am -- which has traversed 1970's rock from prog-rock excursions to terse electro songs -- is added to the New Year's Eve bill; tickets are $35.  PARELES    PEACHES, TriBeCa Grand, 2 Avenue of the Americas, at Church Street, (212) 519-6677. With deadpan calm and rhyming skills so modest that Lil' Kim won't be losing any sleep, Peaches raps about sex, sex and more sex over bare-bones drum-machine beats and sampled power chords. It's a dopey high-concept shtick that can turn into stupid fun. Tonight, doors open at 10 p.m., and the disc jockeys including Spencer Product, DJ Language, Edward Newton and others until 8 a.m. Tickets are $99.  PARELES    * MARC RIBOT Y LOS CUBANOS POSTIZOS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The guitarist Marc Ribot, who has been in Tom Waits's band, can thread melodies through chord changes or make his guitar clank and boing. With his band Los Cubanos Postizos, he lovingly reaches back to the elegant Cuban melodies of Arsenio Rodriguez, giving them just a little modern edge. Tonight, the group is joined by Joe Bataan, who grew up in Spanish Harlem and, in the 1960's, began merging Engligh lyrics, Latin rhythms and funk into boogaloo and what he called Latin soul. Shows at 9:30 and 11:30; admission is $30 for the early show, $40 for the late show, or $60 for both, including a Champagne toast at midnight.  PARELES    * PATTI SMITH AND HER BAND, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Love, death, transfiguration and pushy guitars have been Patti Smith's staples in the quarter-century since she turned her poetry into punk-rock. Always unpredictable and passionate, she still seeks shamanic revelation with every gig. Her New Year's Eve shows are reflections on the year past and rallying cries for the year to come. Tonight at 9; admission is $55, including a Champagne toast at midnight.  PARELES    SOUKOUS STARS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Soukous is the Congolese music that sends guitars twining over a lilting rumba beat, and the Soukous Stars include two seasoned Congolese musicians, the guitarist Lokassa Ya Mbongo and the bassist Nguoma Lokito, not to mention four female dancers. Tonight, doors open at 8 p.m., the Soukous Stars begin at 10, and three disc jockeys will continue with African and world music until 4 a.m. Admission is $35 with a one-drink minimum.  PARELES    THE STAR SPANGLES, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052. Punk lives on in the hoarse vocals, speed-strummed guitars and revved-up pop melodies of the Star Spangles, whose songs have titles like ''I Live for Speed'' and ''Stay Away From Me.'' Tonight at 8, with River City Rebels, Lady Unluck, Electric Shadows and Thee Minks opening; tickets are $17.50.  PARELES    STRING CHEESE INCIDENT, Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171. This rather, uh, dopey jam band interrupts the Rockettes for a New Year's Eve show at Radio City Music Hall: the group is known for long, leisurely songs that sometimes draw from bluegrass; whereas Phish often used solos to send songs spiraling off in unexpected directions, String Cheese Incident favors more linear digressions, usually returning to the theme sooner rather than later. Tonight at 9; tickets are $70.  KELEFA SANNEH    THE TRACHTENBURG FAMILY SLIDESHOW PLAYERS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The Trachtenburg Family -- Jason Trachtenburg on keyboard and his young daughter Rachel on drums -- picks up collections of slides from garage sales and thrift stores and invents stories and songs around them that can be mocking or oddly moving. Tina Pia Trachtenburg, Jason's wife, runs the slide projector. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $20.  PARELES    * PAUL VAN DYK, Ikon, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-8282. The disk jockey and producer Paul van Dyk came out of East Berlin to become one of the leading figures in trance, the steady-pulsing, eternally upbeat dance music that fills club floors around the world. Various Playstation 2 games, including some still unreleased, will be available for play. Other disk jockeys in the lineup include Jon Obir, Jonathan Ojeda and Powerstar IM; there will also be stilt walkers, trapeze acts and other performers. Tonight at 12:30; tickets from $75 to four-person VIP packages, including hors d'oeuvres and a Champagne toast,for $1,100.  PARELES    * WILCO/THE FLAMING LIPS/SLEATER-KINNEY, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741. After years on the indie-rock and alt-rock circuit, these bands probably can't believe they're playing Madison Square Garden, but their music is big enough for the room. Wilco was once an alt-country band, but those days are long gone. Now its songs mutate on the spot, from straightforward strumming to washes of texture, from minimalist patterns to electronic rumbles, from ballads to brute force. It's moody, unpredictable music that can be testy or simply gorgeous. The Flaming Lips are fond of goofy theatrics and stately, concept-heavy songs carried by Wayne Coyne's plaintive voice, while Sleater-Kinney pours passion into songs that hurtle along but never stop thinking, with jagged guitar lines, wailing vocals and heartfelt lyrics. Tonight 8; tickets are $37.50 to $57.50.  PARELES    ZEN TRICKSTERS, TriBeCa Rock Club, 16 Warren Street, (212) 766-1070. The Zen Tricksters got started two decades ago playing Grateful Dead songs. While they now have their own songs to jam on, they haven't forgotten their early repertory; no less a figure than Phil Lesh of the Dead has called on the expertise of Rob Barraco, a former Trickster keyboardist who will be rejoining his old band for this show. Tonight at 9; tickets are $25.  PARELES    ZLATNE USTE, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Balkan brass bands run like old motorcycles: fast, loud and unstoppable. The 12-piece Zlatne Uste, which means ''golden lips,'' is a New York group with a repertory from the former Yugoslavia and beyond, and it turns tricky meters and zigzag melodies into high-octane party music. Sunday night at 7:30; admission is $10 with a one-drink minimum.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. The smoothest crooner in show business and one of the most dedicated archivists of popular song salutes Christmas, Hanukkah and the classic ballad in his show, ''Holiday Heart Songs.'' Mr. Feinstein has developed into such an accomplished stand-up entertainer that if it were 1965, he would be the host of his own network variety show. The ballads at which he excels include ''Two for the Road,'' ''I Concentrate on You,'' and John Bucchino's semiclassical ''Grateful.'' Tonight from 10 to 11:15, with dinner at 8:30. Cover: $550, including signed CD, dancing, hats, noisemakers, table arrangements and a bottle of Champagne. Ann Hampton Callaway performs tonight in the Regency Ballroom from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., with a 20-minute set by Mr. Feinstein. Cover: $600, including signed CD, dancing, hats, noisemakers, table arrangements and a bottle of Champagne.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semiretirement from performing at the Cafe Carlyle last year, this singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure up ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his signature songs -- ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark'' -- along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight at 8:30, with sets at 11:15 and 1:30 a.m. Cover: $500, including Champagne, a bottle of wine per couple, and party favors. Sold out.  HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $40.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    HIRAM BULLOCK BAND, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Hiram Bullock, a powerful jazz-funk-rock guitarist -- he played with Gil Evans's latter-day groups a lot at this same spot, when it was called Sweet Basil -- is an old favorite on the New York scene. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 tonight; cover charge for first set is $35 with a $15 food or drink minimum; for second set, $50 with a $25 minimum. Tomorrow night, sets are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $20 with a $10 food or drink minimum.  BEN RATLIFF    * CYRUS CHESTNUT TRIO WITH GUESTS, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9595. Cyrus Chestnut, a pianist, swings the way the old guard used to; that's why he was so dazzling when he came on the scene in the early 1990's. But he is also a sentimentalist. Trios happen to be his best setting: they discourage his excesses and push him to his rhythmic limits. His guests include the saxophonist Frank Morgan and trumpeter Marcus Printup. Tonight, the club opens at 7, with a first set from 8:15 to 9:45; a three-course dinner is included for $95. The room opens for the second set at 10 p.m., with music pushing well past midnight; that cover, including a three-course dinner and Champagne toast, is $155. The music will be broadcast live on WBGO-FM (88.3) from 11 p.m. to 12:15 a.m. Sets are tomorrow night at 7:30, 9:30 and 11, and Sunday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.; cover charge for each set is $30 with a $10 minimum at a table and a $5 minimum at the bar.  RATLIFF    SASHA DOBSON WITH CHRIS BYARS OCTET, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-6056. The young singer Sasha Dobson performed a lot with the saxophonist Chris Byars at the old jazz club Smalls, whose owner changed locations and calls his new place the Fat Cat. With the recent launching of Smalls Records and her own release on the label, ''The Darkling Thrush,'' Ms. Dobson returns to her old audience in a new setting. She's a canny improviser with classic Ella-and-Sarah tastes and good pitch; Mr. Byars's arrangements of standards fit her handsomely. Tonight's sets begin at 10 and continue through the night; the cover charge for the entire evening is a thrifty $25.  RATLIFF    JOE FARNSWORTH AND FRIENDS, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7125. Seemingly the No. 1 drummer for the current crop of hard-bop revivalists -- he's a fixture at Smoke, playing with Harold Mabern, George Coleman, Eric Alexander and others -- Joe Farnsworth will jam past midnight with his friends and colleagues. Tonight's first set runs from 9:30 to 10:45 and second set from 11:15 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.; the cover charge is $15, and the minimum, $10 for each set.  RATLIFF    FUNKBOX, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. A sextet playing funk, soul and 1960's- and 70's-style R&B. Tonight, there are two sets of music plus D.J.'s spinning records in the intervals; there is an open bar from 9:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. and a Champagne toast at midnight. The cover is $125.  RATLIFF    * ROY HARGROVE AND FRIENDS, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063.

Tonight, the first set is 8 to 10; admission is $50. The second set is from 10:30 p.m. to 1 a.m.; admission is $75 and includes a Champagne toast. The third set runs from 1:30 to 3 a.m. and costs $40. Beer, wine, soda and coffee are free. (The club is closed tomorrow and Sunday.)  RATLIFF    * SHIRLEY HORN, Le Jazz Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 308-9455. Like so many great American singers, Shirley Horn has Louis Armstrong inflections stamped on her style. They take the form of rhythmic risks over a steady pulse; you listen to her and sense that she could phrase a line however she wanted. But what has always made her different is her ice-menthol delivery in slow tempos, which tends to be more commanding in performance than on record. She'll be recording a new live album for Verve during this engagement at Le Jazz Au Bar. Tonight's sets are at 8 and 10:30; the cover charge is $100 for either set, which includes a Champagne toast during the second set. The second set is sold out. Sets tomorrow night are at 8 and 10:30 and Sunday at 8 p.m.; cover charge for those sets are $50.  RATLIFF    * CHRISTIAN McBRIDE QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. One of the most virtuosic jazz musicians to emerge during the 1990's, the bassist Christian McBride indulges his interests in straight-ahead jazz as much as funk and pop and other areas; he'll play here with a quartet including the saxophonist Ron Blake, the pianist Geoff Keezer and the drummer Terreon Gully, with the singer Melissa Walker accompanying the band. Tonight, doors open at 6:30 for a 7:30 show; the cover charge is $95 and includes a three-course dinner. Doors open at 9:30 for the 10:30 p.m. show, and the cover charge is $150, including a three-course dinner and Champagne at midnight. (The club is closed tomorrow and Sunday.)  RATLIFF    DONNY McCASLIN, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. Mr. McCaslin, the saxophonist who has recently had regular work with Danilo Pérez, works in a young, strong style, with rapid, bravado phrasing, using long breath lines and racing up and down between extremes of the horn's pitch. The quartet includes the guitarist Ben Monder, bassist Ben Street, and drummer Adam Cruz. Sunday night at 9:30, the cover charge is $7 with a two-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    JANIS SIEGEL, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. Famous as a member of the a capella jazz group Manhattan Transfer, Janis Siegel has been making solo records as well; the most recent, ''Sketches of Broadway,'' features jazz arrangements of theater songs. Here she's backed by a quartet including the guitarist Romero Lubambo. Tonight, her first set is at 8; the cover charge is $40 and the minimum is $20. The second set is at 11, with a $75 cover and $20 minimum, and includes Champagne. Sets tomorrow night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40 with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    CHRIS WASHBURNE AND SYOTOS, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. A trombonist and ethnomusicologist who has put in plenty of time around New York's Latin music scene, Mr. Washburne leads a hard-driving Latin jazz band -- a quintet, this weekend -- that puts sophisticated arrangements next to a pan-Latin rhythmic foundation. Sets are tomorrow and Sunday night at 9, 11 and 12:30; there is no cover but there is a $15 drink minimum per person, per set.  RATLIFF    * DR. MICHAEL WHITE'S ORIGINAL LIBERTY JAZZ BAND OF NEW ORLEANS, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The doors open at 8:30 tonight and the first set begins at 9:30; a second set starts at 11:30. The charge for the entire evening is $125, which includes the $25 drink minimum and New Orleans-style food. Reservations and a deposit are necessary. Tomorrow and Sunday, sets are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a $30 cover.  RATLIFF    * CASSANDRA WILSON, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Cassandra Wilson plays to jazz audiences, but isn't concerned with old definitions of the music. She's vaguely bohemian, though no one is more cosmopolitan; she has invented a playhouse of Southern-rustic allusions, jazz standards, singer-songwriter music and pop-art radio hits, from ''Corcovado'' to Cyndi Lauper. She reshuffles the deck for instrumentation, putting a conga player next to a harmonica player who makes cello noises, next to a jazz guitarist playing folk or rural blues. Somehow -- her dusky alto voice helps -- the result is original, self-conscious art, mellow and conspiratorially playful. Her band now includes the harmonica player Gregoire Maret, the guitarist Marvin Sewell, the bassist Reginald Veal and the percussionist Jeffrey Haynes. Each set begins with the opening act of Cephas & Wiggins, the Piedmont-blues guitar-and-voice duo. The first set tonight begins at 7; the $55 cover charge at the bar and $75 at tables include a Champagne toast. A $5 minimum applies for all tickets. The second set is sold out. Sets tomorrow and Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30, and the cover charge is $50 with a $5 minimum.  RATLIFF    THE WOLLESONS, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. A funk-jazz group led by the drummer Kenny Wolleson, who has played all over the map of New York jazz. Music starts at 11 tonight; the cover is $20, with a two-drink minimum, including a Champagne toast.

Full reviews of recent music performances:  nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' For its New Year's Eve offering, the Metropolitan Opera presents a revival of its colorful and appealing 1983 production of Rossini's timeless comedy ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia.'' The first performance last weekend seemed one rehearsal or so away from being settled, but the spirited cast -- headed by Dwayne Croft as Figaro, Katarina Karneus as Rosina, Matthew Polenzani as Count Almaviva and Carlos Chausson as Dr. Bartolo -- was amusing and endearing. Maurizio Benini's conducts a lithe and breezy account of Rossini's clever and delightful score. Word is already out that Dame Edna Everage will show up at this gala performance and perform, along with several other surprise guests who will be tucked, somehow, into the show. Tonight at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $250.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'KATYA KABANOVA' Fresh from her triumph as Strauss's Salome last season, the radiant soprano Karita Mattila is back at the Metropolitan Opera in another riveting portrayal: the title role of Janacek's great 1921 opera ''Katya Kabanova,'' a revival of Jonathan Miller's starkly powerful 1991 production. The tragic story tells of a winsome young woman in a 19th-century rural Russian town and her decent but weak-willed husband, who lets his reproachful widowed mother rule his life. Desperately lonely, Katya commits adultery and is driven by her guilt to drown herself in the Volga. Janacek's haunting, harmonically restless music takes you to the core of the story. So does Ms. Mattila, who sings with an affecting blend of cool Nordic sound and gleaming power. Jorma Silvasti as her lover, Boris, Chris Merritt as her blustery husband and Judith Forst as her withering mother-in-law give strong performances. Jiri Belohlavek, in his Met debut, conducts a stylistically authoritative and rhapsodic performance. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.  TOMMASINI    NEW YORK GILBERT AND SULLIVAN PLAYERS This popular and venerable (well, relatively speaking) G&S troupe offers its traditional New Year's Eve Champagne gala, featuring light-opera favorites, send-ups and, as a challenge to aficionados, any G&S song the audience requests. Tonight at 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $55 to $75.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'RODELINDA' Most of Handel's operas were introduced at the King's Theater, a house of 850 seats in London. But for its premiere production of Handel's ''Rodelinda,'' a musically rich and psychologically complex masterpiece, the Met proves that with the right approach and the right cast Handel can be presented effectively in a grand-size house. Renée Fleming brings her radiant voice and courageous vulnerability to her performance of the title character, the despairing queen of the Lombard king of Milan, Bertarido, who has been usurped and is thought dead. The incomparable countertenor David Daniels sings Bertarido. The refined tenor Kobie van Rensburg, the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe and the sweet-voiced countertenor Bejun Mehta are also excellent. The handsome production, directed by Stephen Wadsworth in his Met debut, sets the seventh-century story in early 18th-century Milan. Harry Bicket, also making his company debut, conducts with fleetness and assurance. Tomorrow at 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office.  TOMMASINI    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC The holidays at this intimate floating concert hall are apparently a time to get back to the basics: namely, Bach. Christmas Eve featured the ''Goldberg'' Variations and tonight the barge rings in the New Year with three of the six ''Brandenburg'' Concertos (Nos. 2, 4 and 5), the Double Concerto for Oboe and Violin (BWV 1060) and other works. The ensemble is made up of barge regulars like Olga Bloom, the soft-spoken yet fiery octogenarian who bought this onetime coffee-hauling vessel back in 1975 and had the pluck and vision to turn it into one of New York's loveliest concert halls. Ms. Bloom, a violinist, performs rarely these days, but tonight she will be on stage with the musicians. Tonight at 7:30, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $125.  JEREMY EICHLER    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances:  nytimes.com/dance.    ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER. This closing weekend is the last time to see these smart, passionate and technically impressive Ailey dancers, who perform as if they believe in the power of communication. Tonight's program begins with two of the season's new works and ends with Ailey's ''Revelations,'' which certainly rises to the occasion of a year's ending. The company begins the new year tomorrow night with the ballet, in a program that includes Ailey's restaged ''Hidden Rites.'' Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $25 to $110. (Related review, Page 2.)  JENNIFER DUNNING    LES BALLETS TROCKADERO DE MONTE CARLO The ladies will celebrate New Year's Eve tonight with an early show that they promise will be full of surprises. Given the kind of surprises this all-male troupe produces in ordinary programs -- from giddy high jinks to true virtuoso dancing and lovingly knowledgeable ballet restagings -- the evening might well be a good way to send off the old year with cheerful high spirits. There will be no performance on New Year's Day. The company will end its winter season with two performances of a program that includes ''Les Sylphides,'' ''Go for Barocco,'' ''Dying Swan'' and the underwater scene from the 19th century ''Humpbacked Horse.'' Today at 5 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Manhattan (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42.  DUNNING    NEW YORK CITY BALLET ''The Nutcracker'' is here. What more can be said? The company is performing George Balanchine's magical production of Tchaikovsky's fairy-tale ballet, complete with lovely snowflakes and sugar plums and malicious marauding mice. There's lots of sumptuous spectacle and delicious dancing. No performances today or tomorrow; Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $26 to $96.  JACK ANDERSON    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most museums and galleries are closed on New Year's Day. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but holiday hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined elements of East and West, high and low, old and new: African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Literature and music shaped the work no less than Picasso, George Grosz and Vermeer did. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    * 'THE CASTELLANI AND ITALIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL JEWELRY,' Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, through Feb. 6. A dazzling look at the redoubtable Castellani jewelry firm that lasted in Rome from 1814 to 1927 and its production of exquisitely wrought jewelry modeled on the Etruscan, Greek and Roman relics being dug up all over Italy. The more than 250 objects on view include examples of one of the firm's specialties, micromosaics: minuscule, highly labor-intensive mosaic insets on gold that depicted classical, religious and other motifs; carved gems like cameos and intaglios; and stagey productions of shimmering gems in ornate, drop-dead settings for its really privileged clients. This is not a show for dilettantes, requiring strength of eye and the patience of Job for exquisite detail. How much you enjoy it depends on your appetite for jewelry in depth. But it's a spectacular, even for over-the-top, bling-blingy New York. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $3; students and 65+, $2.  GRACE GLUECK    KERRY JAMES MARSHALL, 'ONE TRUE THING: MEDITATIONS ON BLACK AESTHETICS,' the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through Jan. 9. Partly to provoke a discussion about freedom and ''Black Aesthetics,'' the MacArthur prize-winning, Chicago-based Mr. Marshall is exhibiting recent works in a variety of media, including photographs, videos and installation. Painting is still his strong suit, however. Among the exhibition's high points are a huge, Hopperesque street scene in which a few people seem to be waiting for a warehouse-size liquor store to open; and a satiric vision of ecstatic Afro-centrism featuring a black couple running joyfully naked through a pastoral landscape. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission, $7; 65+ and students, $3.  KEN JOHNSON    * 'RALPH EUGENE MEATYARD,' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Feb. 27. Maybe the most oddball of all the photographers of the ordinary, Meatyard gives reality a flip that often puts it into the realm of surreality. His creepy, staged shots of family and friends in strange masks but homey settings, or unmasked in derelict places that turn spooky, are weirdly unsettling while at the same time involved with the familiar actions of everyday life. His idea of family photographs was to take his wife and three children to broken-down houses around Lexington, Ky., the town they lived in, and depict them playing, jumping and rolling around, wearing masks or making faces, in dank interiors with broken windows or standing aimlessly in front of ruined facades. Wanting to convey the mysterious, inexpressible ties among people, Meatyard did not coax smiles or pleasing body language or any sentiment at all from his subjects. Vacant stares and brooding countenances are more the rule. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 65+.  GLUECK    * 'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. Hmmm. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.  GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    ROGER BROWN, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338, through Jan. 15. Roger Brown (1941-1997) was one of the most original artists to emerge from Chicago after World War II. He blended influences from Indian miniature painting, Giorgio DiChirico, Grant Wood, outsider art and old comics to create mysteriously enchanting landscapes and cityscapes populated by tiny, silhouetted people. The nine canvases dating from 1968 to 1982 on view here are the first Brown exhibition to be presented in New York in 10 years.  JOHNSON    ANTOINE VOLLON: 'A PAINTER'S PAINTER,' Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street (212) 879-0500, through Jan. 7. The realist painter Antoine Vollon (1833-1900) was a technical wiz, known as the Chardin of his day for his skill at still lifes. A steady exhibitor at the annual salons in Paris, he also did all-but-Impressionist country and urban scapes. At his best he was a master of the paint medium, slathering on pigment in quick Manet-like strokes. A beautiful example here is a simple but wonderfully expressive rendition of a pile of butter, so real-life in color and energetically laid-on texture that it might have been painted with butter itself. More complex still lifes are devoted to writhing fish, dead rabbits and compositions rife with fruit, flowers and vessels that evoke the bravura extravaganzas of Dutch masters. Vollon's work smacks too much of other artists to make him Truly Important, but his sensuous wallows in paint are well worth wider notice.  GLUECK    Galleries: 57th Street    JOAN FONTCUBERTA: 'PIN ZHUANG,' Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223, through Jan. 8. Prompted by a 2001 incident in which an American spy plane that crashed in China was thoroughly picked over and returned to the United States in pieces, this show depicts model planes carefully misconstructed by the mischievous Spanish artist Joan Fontcuberta. Photographed against backdrops suggesting outer space, the planes look like flying piles of engineered debris but also suggest advanced weapon systems, NASA-conceived orbiters and techy sculptures by the American constructivist Theodore Roszak. ''Starfighter,'' for one, a fearsome assemblage of miscellaneous parts with a terrifying needle nose, hovers like a hungry bird of prey.  GLUECK    JULIO LARRAZ, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900, through Jan. 8. Mr. Larraz, who came to the United States from Cuba as a teenager in 1961, produces a generously painterly realism that often veers into surrealistic fantasy. His canvases record scenes of ordinary beauty, like the images of a melting block of ice or potted bougainvilleas for sale on a sunlighted boat deck. Then there is Vincent van Gogh visiting a modern aquarium in which a big shark hovers behind the thick glass.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    SU-MEI TSE, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Jan. 22. This exhibition features the work that won the prize for best national pavilion -- Luxembourg's -- at the 2003 Venice Bienale. It consists of a white neon sign that reads ''[E:r] conditionné,'' and two dreamlike video projections. In one, the artist plays the cello on a grassy, alpine prominence; in the other, men in green janitorial uniforms in a desert use green-bristled brooms to sweep sand into small piles.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    AMY ELLINGSON: 'SEMPER AUGUSTUS,' Charles Cowles, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-8999, through Jan. 15. This California-based artist's first New York solo show presents paintings that are optically enthralling and sensuously tactile. Ms. Ellingson generates complex, layered patterns of gridded ovals on a computer, and converts them into satiny, subtly color-coordinated oil-painted fields, on top of which she applies grids of thick, white or black ovals made in encaustic.  JOHNSON    'MATERIAL AS METAPHOR,' Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, through Jan. 15. An exhibition of works that are emphatically physical yet poetic includes comically anthropomorphic sculptures by Miroslaw Balka; a darkly surrealistic sculptural landscape by Mark Manders; an arrangement of mostly yellow found and hand-made objects by Ian Kiaer; roses wrapped in spirals of cotton by Valeska Soares; elegantly spare fabric works by Helen Mirra; and lumps of fat in a cardboard box by Joseph Beuys.  JOHNSON    * MARTHA ROSLER, ''Photomontages: 1965-2004,'' Gorney Bravin & Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372, through Jan. 8. Martha Rosler made her first series of photomontages in the 1960's and 70's as responses to the Vietnam War, sexism and America's consumer culture, phenomena that she presented as closely related. This year she returned to collage and the same subjects, the difference being that the war is now in Iraq. Both old and new series are brought together in this major show. And the fact that they form a seamless flow has every bit as much to say about the consistencies of American political history as it does about the vigilant career of one of our most astute commentarial artists.  COTTER    Other Galleries    * A. BALASUBRAMANIAM, Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, through Jan 22. The work of this exceptional young artist, based in India, is about the play of material solidity and illusion. His first show at Talwar two years ago included a full-size human form that seemed to pass through a gallery wall; for the current show he has cast his own head in an opaque, waxy substance of a kind used to produce air fresheners, so that the self-portrait will dissolve through slow evaporation. Time and change are also the subjects of other work here, including a burnt drawing that measured the passing of a day with a slow-burning fuse. And the whole, spare, resonant show comes together in a sculpture of a single slender branch bristling with sharp thorns and cast in solid gold; the more alluring illusion is, the more be painful it can be.  COTTER    Last Chance    'EUROPEAN BRONZES FROM THE QUENTIN COLLECTION,' the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, through Sunday. During the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in the collection and technical exploration of small-scale bronzes from the Renaissance, depicting gods, goddesses, religious figures, nymphs, fauns, satyrs, animals and simple folk. About 35 of these 15th-to-mid-18th-century statuettes, assembled by an Argentine collector, star in this lively show. Originally inspired by mythological themes or classical marble statuary, and often reconstructed in innovative ways by well-known artists, the statuettes were eagerly sought by European connoisseurs, who admired their masterly modeling, subtle surfacing and elegant finishes. A wonderful example here is a rendition -- by an unknown 16th-century Italian sculptor -- of Hercules. Happily, these bronzes are displayed without vitrines, so they can be examined closely from every angle. Today and tomorrow, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sunday, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for 62+; $5 for students.  GLUECK    * 'FORM FOLLOWS FASHION,' Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 217-7999, through today. This ravishing show emphasizes fashion as a formal, abstract art, implicitly geometric, architectural, even in moments of excess. So it is not surprising in this context that formal also means evening wear, the genre in which garments are freed most decisively from function, or that couture gowns by designers from Charles James to Ralph Rucci, enhanced by the invisible mannequins, make this show a garden of unearthly capricious, silken delights. The art of the times is also startlingly palpable, notably in the pyramidal black and white gown that Michel Goma designed for Patou in the early 60's, which is a near knockoff of a motif used by Myron Stout and Ellsworth Kelly. Hours: today, noon to 8 p.m. Free.  ROBERTA SMITH    ODILI DONALD ODITA: 'NOTES FROM PARADISE,' Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-3290, closing today. The Nigerian-born, Tallahassee, Fla.-based Mr. Odita paints hard-edged, gridded, beautifully color-coordinated abstractions with intimations of landscape and African textile design. They are a pleasure to view, and the wedding of modernism and traditionalism is something to ponder.  JOHNSON    JIM SULLIVAN, Nancy Hoffman, 429 West Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-6676, through Tuesday. Made with a fine, sensuous touch on long horizontal panels, Mr. Sullivan's paintings present panoramic views of fantastic primeval landscapes. In places they look as if they were sampled from paintings by Thomas Cole, Frederic Church and Martin Johnson Heade, but they are not postmodernist jokes. Rather, they project a genuinely romantic vision of Edenic wholeness and divine beneficence.  JOHNSON    JOEL-PETER WITKIN: 'HEART BEATS DUST,' Ricco-Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-4819, closing today. This pioneer of high-art, gross-out, postmodernist photography continues to produce faux-antique pictures of amputees, hermaphrodites, severed body parts and absurdly overwrought erotic tableaux. He has also ventured, unconvincingly, into Surrealistic collage, and he has applied paint by hand to some of his prints. A good title for this exhibition would be ''Lost in Transition.''  JOHNSON    XAVIER VEILHAN: 'THE PHOTOREALIST PROJECT,' National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through Sunday. This inventive French sculptor has conceived an unusual installation for five photorealist paintings from the 70's by masters of the genre: Robert Bechtle, Robert Cottingham, Richard Estes, Ralph Goings and Richard McClean. The paintings are installed flush with walls of glossy, stretched black plastic and lighted by low, cylindrical floor lamps. The effect approaches but doesn't quite reach a magical, dematerialized illusionism. It is interesting but not an improvement on the standard white cube gallery. Hours: today through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and 65+.

7," SUNDAY 12|26    MUSEUMS, WITH SPACE FOR VISITORS  If you don't plan an activity for your out-of-town visitors, you'll all just end up going to the movies and they could do that back home in Wichita or Winnemucca. But the crowds at the Museum of Modern Art will be murder, and admission for five costs $100. Still, there are plenty of museums where you won't be crammed ankle to neck. Last year the Neue Galerie, devoted to German and Austrian art, got fewer than 1,000 visitors the day after Christmas. The museum is at 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, and open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. today; it is showing ''Comic Grotesque,'' an exhibition of black humor and satire in German art from 1870 to 1940. (Children under 12 are not admitted.) Today is also a good time to head to El Museo del Barrio (1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.), where the sprawling ''Retratos: 2,000 Years of Latin American Portraits'' is on display. The Museum of Sex (233 Fifth Avenue, at 27th Street, 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.) is also doing historical recon with an exhibition of American pinup photography from 1860 to 1960, and it certainly won't be clogged with families. Or take your guests to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum (90 Orchard Street), so at least they'll stop making fun of your apartment. (Guided tours, with a limit of 15 people, run from 11:15 a.m. through 4:45 p.m.)    DOING GATSBY  A revival of A.R. Gurney's ''Golden Age'' opens today. In the play, first staged in 1981, a young striver seeks to wrest a secret chapter of ''The Great Gatsby'' from the woman who inspired the character Daisy. The chapter is thought to depict an intimate encounter between Daisy and Gatsby -- which would surely have made high school students more eager to read the book. To get his hands on the chapter, our detective engages in some seduction himself.  Access Theater, 380 Broadway, just below Canal Street, TriBeCa; 8 p.m.; $18 to $32. (Through Jan. 8.)    AIRPORT DVD RENTALS  Heading home for the holidays? Here's potential help for those who are dreading the journey, from InMotion Pictures: portable DVD players for rent with a library of 200 DVD titles, from 27 kiosks in 22 North American airports. Perfect for that most captive of audiences: passengers flying with or near aggravated youngsters. (Battery life is guaranteed for only four hours, so reserve additional batteries for that trip to Kuala Lumpur.) If you're only flying one way, just mail the DVD back in the provided packaging. The company will mail the machines out, too. It's open 365 days a year -- and also offers a subscription service at $9.99 a month and sells DVD players, cameras and the like. The La Guardia kiosk is in the Central Terminal, upstairs from the food court, and open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.     As for what happens when you arrive at your relatives' home, well, InMotion takes no responsibility for that.  www.inmotionpictures.com    MONDAY 12|27    HARDCORE NIGHT  Tonight's excuse for a mosh pit, the charmingly titled Stillborn Fest, brings the punk rock old-timers Agnostic Front to Manhattan. Nearly a quarter-century into their careers, these tattooed anarchist-idealists will be joined by less political but equally thrash-worthy bands, including Hatebreed and God Forbid. The lineup includes Candiria, which has recovered from a serious accident in 2002 in which the band's tour van was mowed down by a tractor-trailer. Expect dedications to Dimebag (Darrell Abbott), the former guitarist of Pantera who was killed recently.  Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan;6:15 p.m.; $22.50.    ONE MAN, TWO WOMEN  Today, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater closes ''Themepark Superstar,'' a one-man show by John Flynn that recounts a torturous summer working at Hershey Park in Pennsylvania. On Thursday, the theater will close ''Rode Hard and Put Away Wet,'' a sketch comedy evening with two young actresses, June Raphael and Casey Wilson.  307 West 26th Street, Chelsea; 8 p.m.; $5.    LOBSTER FACE  Magdalena Gómez, a poet and radical playwright, has hit her Judy Blume phase. In her new play, ''Lobster Face (Or the Shame of Amanda Cockshutt),'' the title character takes us through the struggles of high school, which include combating an evil teacher and falling in love with a janitor.  Intar 53 Theater, 510 West 53rd Street, Clinton; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Jan 2.)    TUESDAY 12|28    DVD'S: WE COME WITH FRIENDS  The bundling trend in DVD's reaches new peaks: the disaster flick ''The Day After Tomorrow'' (Fox, $34.78) is being shipped today with tempting companions in different variations: ''Independence Day,'' ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,'' ''Master and Commander'' and ''X2.'' ''DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story'' (Fox, $34.78) gets the same treatment, with ''Office Space,'' ''Stuck on You,'' ''Super Troopers'' and ''There's Something About Mary.'' But ''Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy'' (Universal, $29.99) confidently goes it alone. For TV on DVD, there's ''King of the Hill: The Complete Third Season'' (Fox, $39.98), and a big release of all six seasons of ''Sex and the City'' retails at $339.92.    DETROIT HISTORY  The MC5's ''Purity Accuracy'' (Easy Action, $98.49) is a six-CD boxed set of live recordings, studio oddities and historical niblets from the great Detroit proto-punk band. Other musical releases today include Marlene Dietrich's ''Love Songs'' and, in a similar vein, Sarah Vaughan's ''Love Songs,'' both from Columbia-/Legacy ($11.98).    WEDNESDAY 12|29    MOVIES: SCARLETT JOHANSSON'S REVENGE  In ''A Love Song for Bobby Long,'' which opens today in New York and Los Angeles, Scarlett Johansson does the smoldering-rural-teen thing while forced to live in a cabin with John Travolta. (It's not a horror film, honest.) ''In Good Company,'' which also opens today, finds her doing the sleek-young-urban-sophisticate thing opposite Topher Grace, who plays her dad's boss.     ''The Jew Who Stole Christmas'' plays at 7 p.m. at the Two Boots Pioneer; it's a sci-fi fantasy about Y2K, mystic Judaism and Satan. Lincoln Center begins a weeklong run of Jacques Tati's 1967 ''Playtime'' at Walter Reade Theater, with a new, gorgeously restored print.  Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center.    AIR FOR FLUTE  The ever popular James Galway can be difficult to get to see in person. ''Live From Lincoln Center'' brings its eighth performance by Sir James to your house tonight. With Beverly Sills as host, Sir James will play Bach, Saint-Saëns and Vaughan Williams, with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra.  PBS; 8 p.m.    FROM BROADWAY TO TRIBECA  Adam Pascal, who starred as Roger in ''Rent'' in 1996 and did turns in ''Aida'' in 2000 and 2004, doesn't want to get pigeonholed as a Broadway guy. He'll play tonight in support of his new classic-rock-style CD, ''Civilian'' (Sh-K Boom).  Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa; 8 p.m.; $20.    THURSDAY 12|30    PATTI SMITH'S MANY MOODSPatti Smith's New Year's shows can be the stuff of legend, depending on her mood. Sometimes she gets surly at audience members, bad sound or presidential elections. But she can't stay mad: two years ago, she borrowed a cellphone from an audience member and called her children in Michigan so everyone could wish them a happy new year.  Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $40 (Also Wednesday and Friday.)    THE CHILD'S TALE  Mamillius, the child-prince of Bohemia, dies of grief in Act III of Shakespeare's ''Winter's Tale'' and never gets the chance to enjoy courtly dramas and deceptions. (At least he isn't abandoned in the desert, as other children are in the play.) ''Mamillius,'' an extreme adaptation by Sheldon Deckelbaum, takes on the tale from the befuddled child's perspective.  La MaMa, First Floor Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; 7:30 p.m.; $15. (Through Jan. 16.)    ROBERT RYMAN EXPLAINS HIMSELF  PaceWildenstein, one of the few galleries open this week, is showing an exhibition of Robert Ryman's new paintings. Mr. Ryman, now in his mid-70's, is still making his snowy, puffy pictures of accumulated whiteness, but these latest ones are distinguished by their dark backgrounds, which add contrast and drama. In the show's catalog, Mr. Ryman writes for the first time about his art.  534 West 25th Street, Chelsea; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; free. Through Jan. 8.    FRIDAY 12|31    CONGOLESE DANCE PARTY  Soukous Stars, a party band that carries much old-school cred in the Congolese community, bust out the Kinshasa rumba at Satalla, a 200-seat club that focuses on world music. After the live set, D.J.'s take over with African dance music until the early morning.  37 West 26th Street, Manhattan; 10 p.m.; $35.    KUNG FU NEW YEAR'S  You'll barely get outside before midnight; the first of three Bruce Lee-related films begins at 6 p.m. That would be ''Bruce Lee: Fist of the Unicorn'' (1972). At 8, ''Bruce Lee, We Miss You'' (1977), an action film about someone named Bruce Li who tries to find answers about Bruce Lee's death. Finally, at 10, ''Enter the Fat Dragon'' (1978): it stars the action-comedian Sammo Hung in a farcical take on Lee's legend.  Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; $9.    JAZZ AND FAMILY  The Trachtenburg Family Slide Show Players -- that trendy mom-dad-and-daughter trio -- play in a refreshingly small and funky space tonight. Afterward, at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Marc Ribot's Los Cubanos Postizos features Joe Bataan, a pioneer of New York Latin soul, and, of course, Mr. Ribot's complicated jazzy guitar.  Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side; 7:30 p.m., $20 (Trachtenburg); $30 for Mr. Ribot's early set, $40, late set.    INTERNET SELF-TICKETING  Can't get tickets to the last show (ever, in the United States at least) by the retiring East Village pop heroes Luna? Itching to experience Kurt Masur do Beethoven's Ninth at Avery Fisher Hall? Craving Wilco at Madison Square Garden? Cracking to see next Sunday's final New York City Ballet ''Nutcracker''? Back in the day, we'd be reduced to sidewalk-skulking. Now we have a more humane, less humiliating way to scalp: Craigslist accepts calls for tickets and ticket offerings, with largely at-cost classical, pop and Broadway tickets. Participate in this little digital utopia at your own risk, naturally.  http://newyork.craigslist.org/tix.    SATURDAY 1|1    '42ND STREET' WILL BE CLOSED  Everything good -- and almost-good -- must end on Broadway sometime. Today's the last performance of the Bollywood shuffle as ''Bombay Dreams'' closes at the Broadway Theater. Tomorrow marks the last performances of ''Golda's Balcony'' at the Helen Hayes Theater and, for ''42nd Street'' at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, the understudy will have her last chance to play the Understudy.  ''Golda'' and ''Bombay'' tickets: Telecharge.com. ''42nd Street'': Ticketmaster.com.    MUSICAL ODDITY  Digging in the mines of salsa, Siberian folk, swing and punk, the totally danceable big band Yöke features the sexy Russian snarling of Ilias Muratov.  Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan; 9 p.m.; $12.    CALLING ON NEW YEAR'S DAY  The small Merchant's House Museum revives a 19th-century tradition: going a-calling on New Year's Day. Those who go a-calling at the museum today will find Champagne punch and conviviality.  29 East Fourth Street, East Village;, 3 to 6 p.m.; $25, $15 for members.    LAST CHANCE JANACEK  Tonight marks the last performance of Janacek's ''Katya Kabanova'' at the Met; the soprano Karita Mattila takes her last disgraced jump into the river.  Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center; 8 p.m.; $40 to $215.

9," SUNDAY 12|19    HAVE HARP, WILL TRAVEL  The harp-playing, child-voiced Northern California folkie Joanna Newsom sounds like Squeaky Fromme playing Charles Manson songs, with sweeter lyrics. She and her harp throw a holiday party with Smog and Weird War; the three will play round robin all night, and they've demanded, for no discernible reason, that the audience wear sweaters paired with knit caps or scarves.    Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side; 7:30 p.m.; $15.    SHAKESPEARE REMIX REDUX  ''Best of Both Worlds'' is a gospel-R&B version of Shakespeare's ''Winter's Tale.'' It's directed by Diane Paulus, who's also the director of the long-running ''Donkey Show,'' a disco adaptation of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' What's next -- a salsa-and-meringue update of ''Titus Andronicus''?    Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton; 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.; $47.    BUILDING BALLOONS  A new installation by the architect and artist Yumi Kori consists entirely of balloons, light and the breath of whoever visits the gallery. It is open from 1 to 6 p.m. on Sundays, but every day after sunset viewers are encouraged to gather outside the front windows to watch the balloons and bathe in green light. For a strangely melancholy event, mark your calendars for the closing party, on Jan. 9, when Ms. Kori's balloons will be deflated.    The Phatory, 618 East Ninth Street, East Village; Fridays to Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m.; Wednesdays and Thursdays, 7 to 10 p.m. Closed Christmas Eve to Jan. 4; free.    Monday 12|20    MOD QUEENS  Brini Maxwell, a longtime star of Manhattan public access television, recently graduated to her own home décor and lifestyle program on the Style network. (It can be seen Thursdays at 9 p.m.) Tonight, Ms. Maxwell -- whose (male) birth name is unknown -- takes her peculiar but charming June Cleaver-meets-Heloise shtick to the stage.    Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village; 7 p.m.; $17.    GOOD VIBRATIONS  Oh, mamma mia! While waiting for ''Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others,'' the Morrissey musical, to hit London's stages in July, fans of pop-song theater can make do with ''Good Vibrations.'' The plot, cobbled from Beach Boys songs, features a trim and often swimsuit-clad cast bouncing about the stage. Previews begin.    Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $66 to $91.    FOR RUSSELL BY RUSSELL  A cabaret tribute to Bill Russell (most notable for having written the book and lyrics to ''Side Show,'' everyone's favorite musical about conjoined twins) goes by the hilarious name ''Belters We Have Heard on High.'' Mr. Russell will be joined by Alice Ripley, among others; Ms. Ripley originated the role of Violet Hilton, the twin on the left -- no, right? Anyone?    The Duplex, 61 Christopher Street, West Village; 7 p.m.; $10.    TUESDAY 12|21    A CONSTELLATION OF CELEBRITY  In the week's musical DVD releases, hero worship (pro and con). Kultur releases both ''Frank Sinatra: The Man and the Myth'' and Dean Martin: The One and Only'' (each $19.99). (Related: Deana Martin will discuss ''Memories Are Made of This: Dean Martin Through His Daughter's Eyes,'' her family memoir recording the grim realities of growing up the child of a famous entertainer, on Channel 75 of Sirius satellite radio at 9 p.m.) For the ugly side of mythologizing, there's ''Hype!,'' a 1996 documentary about the rise and fall of Seattle's grunge scene ($14.98, Lions Gate). It includes performances by Gas Huffer, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and the Posies.    REVISITING NUMBERS  Can anyone yet bear to think about politics again? Two flashback programs at the Museum of Television and Radio are voting yes. A 2002 documentary of George W. Bush's first presidential campaign, ''Journeys With George,'' by Alexandra Pelosi, the daughter of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, is paired with ''True Life: I'm a Candidate,'' an 80-minute episode from the MTV series ''True Life'' that follows two young Congressional candidates in 2000: Dylan Glenn, a black Republican who just lost a re-election bid in Georgia, and John Cranley, who a year after his loss was elected to the City Council in Cincinnati. 25 West 52nd Street, Manhattan; 12:30 p.m. (Tuesdays through Sundays, with an additional 5:30 p.m. screening on Thursdays); $5 to $10. (Through Jan. 9.)    WEDNESDAY 12|22    DVD'S: CANDIDATES AND ZOMBIES  Just out: Kevin Kline's turn as Cole Porter in ''De-Lovely'' ($26.98, MGM) and Meryl Streep's turn as a Senator Who Is Not Based on Hillary Rodham Clinton, Honest, in ''The Manchurian Candidate'' ($29.95, Paramount). Cult hit releases include ''Napoleon Dynamite'' ($29.98, 20th Century Fox) and ''Shaun of the Dead'' ($29.98, Universal). For TV collectors, there's ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' ($49.98, Fox Home Entertainment, broadcast in 1993 and 1994) and ''Star Trek Voyager: The Complete Seventh Season'' ($129.99, Paramount Home Entertainment), that show's satisfying conclusion, with a temporally overlapping Captain and Admiral Janeway.    TALES OF THE ECHO  A Japanese melding of movement-based theater styles, ''Tales of the Echo'' draws on child-friendly fables, channeling them through an array of forms like Butoh and even Takarazuka, an all-female performance style that has much in common with the artificial glamour and elaborate movement of drag performance.    TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street; 2 p.m.; $15 to $23. (Also on Monday and Tuesday, at 8 p.m.)    LAST- MINUTE CULTURE GIFTS  The Museum of Modern Art's design stores -- at 81 Spring Street and at the museum itself on West 53rd Street -- will stay open on Christmas Eve until 6 p.m. Broadway.com offers gift certificates for any show the service sells on Broadway or the West End: those are $120, although the buyer will be refunded any unused money if cheaper tickets are bought. Lincoln Center gift certificates are available at www.lincolncenter.org. And for the most pure of heart, PBS gift memberships are available at www.thirteen.org.    THURSDAY 12|23    SINGING HIS WAY HOME  In the film ''Swades,'' Mohan Bhargava (played by Shahrukh Khan, a major Indian cinema star) leaves his hot-shot job at NASA to return to India in search of his childhood nanny. Along the way, he rekindles a romance and breaks into song. Sort of like a Julia Roberts-Ricky Martin love story with a cross-cultural backdrop, but in Hindi, with English subtitles.    ImaginAsian Theater, 239 East 59th Street, Manhattan; 1, 5:30 and 9:30 p.m.; $10; $8 for children. (Ends today.)    IN DARGER'S WORLD  ''In the Realms of the Unreal,'' directed by Jessica Yu, is a film about Henry Darger, the outsider artist who died in the early 1970's and left behind a huge body of previously unseen work, including a 15,000-page illustrated novel. But it's less a documentary than an interpretation of his aesthetic; it uses animation to set us adrift in Darger's private world.    Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village; $10; $5 for members. (Through Jan 4; opens at the Castro Theater in San Francisco on Friday.)    THE GOOD GUEST APPEARANCE  A sighting of the actress Julia Stiles -- who appeared in Matt Damon's ''Bourne'' action series and ''Save the Last Dance,'' the ''Bring It On'' of the ballet set -- comes free with purchase after the Eve Ensler play ''The Good Body.'' The surprisingly politically minded Ms. Stiles will talk with Ms. Ensler, the creator of the ''Vagina Monologues.'' ''The Good Body'' will close on Jan. 2.    Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $81.25.    FRIDAY 12|24    ON THE RADIO  This week, Jim Caruso's ''Cast Party,'' an Internet radio program and a live Monday-night event at Birdland that's devoted to the Broadway and cabaret scenes, engages the young musical composer Georgia Stitt. On broadcast, Ms. Stitt's work will be sung by some of the Young Turks of Broadway -- Julia Murney, Andrea Burns, Lauren Kennedy, Susan Egan. On Dec. 27 at 7 p.m., Ms. Stitt and friends will appear at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton.    www.broadwayworld.com/radio.cfm; 8 p.m.    BOYS' CHOIR, BEFORE VACATION  At 4 p.m., St. Thomas Church will offer its annual service of lessons and carols; both the men's and boys' choirs will perform works by 20th-century composers: Sir David Willcocks, the former long-time musical director of the Bach Choir in London; John Scott (who is also St. Thomas's newly appointed organist and music director); and others. At 10:30 p.m., festival music for trumpet, organ and strings will be performed with the period-instrument quartet Concert Royal, followed by Solemn Eucharist of the Nativity. The boys of the choir school will be sent home on Christmas Day, so Saturday's 11 a.m. service is your last chance to see them this year.    Fifth Avenue, at 53rd Street, Manhattan; free.    SNEAKING ONTO BROADWAY  Many Broadway shows are dark for Christmas Eve -- even actors must go home and play the role of Santa -- but some shows have added special matinees. For Christmas Day, it's the inverse: many Saturday matinees are canceled, but evening shows are a go. The TKTS booth just north of Times Square -- the land of discounted, same-day tickets -- will be open from 3 to 8 p.m.; the South Street Seaport location will be closed. On Christmas Day, the TKTS booth near Times Square will sell tickets for evening shows from 3 to 8 p.m.; the Seaport location will be open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. There's no way to predict what bargains there will be, but as of press time, tickets were available through online ticketing agencies like Telecharge and Ticketmaster for the Christmas Day shows, including ''The Producers,'' ''Laugh Whore,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Brooklyn the Musical'' and many others.    SATURDAY 12|25    'WHAT I LIKE ABOUT JEW'  This is the fifth annual outing for ''What I Like About Jew,'' a comedy-cabaret revue. With the songwriter Sean Altman and Rob Tannenbaum, the music editor of Blender magazine, as hosts, the show will feature the cafe musician Eric Schwartz and the comedian Todd Barry. Note: Al Goldstein, former publisher of Screw magazine and now former employee of the Second Avenue Deli, will perform at the show on Thursday.    Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa; 8 and 10:30 p.m.; $12 to $14.    DOWNTOWN TRADITIONS ON THE RADIO  For those yearning for an old-fashioned Christmas feel, huddle around the wireless Internet for radio programming on WFUV. From 1 to 3 p.m., there are highlights of six years of performances of the untraditional tradition ''The Downtown Messiah,'' including performances by David Johansen, the former New York Dolls frontman. Over on PS1 radio, this week marks the station's debut of ''Evening Air,'' with the night-life impresarios Chi Chi Valenti and Johnny Dynell: the show's opening salvo is to reinterpret ''War of the Worlds,'' starring the singer Deborah Harry and a host of muggers and hams.    WFUV: 90.7 FM in New York; nationally at www.wfuv.org. WPS1: www.wps1.org.    THE UN-XMAS MOVIE ROUNDUP: CHILD MOLESTERS AND JEWISH COMEDIANS  Decidedly un-Yule movie choices: Kevin Bacon's turn as a child molester in ''The Woodsman,'' opening Christmas Eve, in limited release. ''Darkness,'' a movie about a house haunted by the massacre of children, is in general release. For lighter fare, your best choice is, as always, Barbra, in 1968's ''Funny Girl'' at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater.    Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; 7 p.m.; $9.
