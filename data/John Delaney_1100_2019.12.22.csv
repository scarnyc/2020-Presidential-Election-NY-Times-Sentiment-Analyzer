Wolfe Tone O’Rourke had flown in from Dublin to stay with his friends Liv and Willie Blumer in their Central Park West apartment.”,"It was to be a quick trip. Wolfe Tone O'Rourke had flown in from Dublin to stay with his friends Liv and Willie Blumer in their Central Park West apartment. At noon, he took the number 1 train downtown to Christopher Street. He emerged from the subway in front of Village Cigars, which had been there since he was a kid. Instinctively, he looked for the World Trade Center. It should have been just to the right of the slanted slate roof of Greenwich House on Barrow Street, but it wasn't. The twin towers had been immortalized by the politicians and the pundits. The truth, O'Rourke knew, was that they had never really been taken into the hearts of New Yorkers before they died. They had been tolerated, but not cherished like the Empire State or the Woolworth and Chrysler Buildings. Stunningly sterile in their simplicity, most referred to them as cereal boxes. The only time O'Rourke was ever really glad to see them was when they punctuated the flatness of the Jersey Turnpike like paired lighthouses, their beacons reassuring him that he was close to home. O'Rourke could see them from his walk-up tenement on Charles Street. He had watched the towers fall from his living room. When the second plane hit, in fear, he made a Perfect Act of Contrition for himself. Then, feeling ashamed of his solipsism, he said another for the innocents who had been tricked into another dimension. And on September 12, 2001, he had smelled them. As the air from Ground Zero drifted north to the Village it had brought its own pungent scent. At first O'Rourke couldn't place it, but then it came back to him, in a replay from his horror days in Vietnam. It was the smell of incinerated flesh. The aroma made when extreme heat vaporizes human beings. In Vietnam napalm did the trick; here in New York it took Boeing jets. And as O'Rourke stood in Sheridan Square on this clear day and gazed, there was only a ghostly slot where the Twin Towers had once stood.

In late September he wrote:   There's something funny going on over at Intrade with respect to the pricing of the Obama and McCain contracts.  Right now, Obama is trading at 52.3 points. That is, Intrade implies that he has a 52.3 percent chance to become the next President.  Now, I happen to think that is a patently absurd price. But you don't have to take my word for it. Over at BetFair, another large UK-based gambling and futures site, you can also buy an Obama contract. But the price there is 1.62, which implies a 61.7 percent chance that Obama will become the next President.  That is a huge spread, 51.5 points versus 61.7 points. This is the equivalent of the Giants being 3-point favorites at the Bellagio Sportsbook, and 7-point favorites at the Mirage down the block.    Josh Rogan at Congressional Quarterly confirms Silver's suspicions:    An internal investigation by the popular online market Intrade has revealed that a single investor's purchases prompted ""unusual"" price swings that significantly boosted the prediction that Sen. John McCain will become president.  Over the past several weeks, the investor has pushed hundreds of thousands of dollars into one of Intrade's predictive markets for the presidential election, the company said, resulting in repeated monetary losses through a strategy that belies any financial motive.  ""The trading that caused the unusual price movements and discrepancies was principally due to a single 'institutional' member on Intrade,"" said the company's chief executive, John Delaney, in a statement released Thursday. ""We have been in contact with the firm on a number of occasions. I have spoken to those involved personally.""  After an extensive investigation into the suspicious trading patterns, Intrade found no wrongdoing or violation of its exchange rules, the company said.  Citing privacy policies, Delaney would not elaborate on who the investor was or whether or not that investor was affiliated in any way with a political campaign.   ""In doing so, of course, that investor was handing money to the other participants in the online market,"" adds Ben Smith at the Politico:   The motive remains a little unclear. Intrade isn't an important enough driver of conventional wisdom for it really to make sense to pump up McCain's stock to boost his prospects, though that's a possible reason to do it. (Would the money then count as a contribution?). The story also suggests, but doesn't really explain, that the investor was buying McCain as a 'hedge' against some other investment. (Ethanol?)""    Michael Froomkin, the lawprof who blogs at Discourse.net, is equally bemused: ""Intrade is somewhat thinly traded in dollar terms, making this sort of manipulation possible."" He continues:     Even so, apparently it was expensive — tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of dollars in opportunity costs (relative to buying similar contracts on other exchanges, or even on Intrade), not to mention losses. But many news organizations look to the headline candidate matchup as a meaningful statistic, making this particular contract the one you would wish to manipulate if you were trying to send false signals to observers.
