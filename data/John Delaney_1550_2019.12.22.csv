Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER'  Opens Tuesday. The New York premiere of a new play by Nilo Cruz (''Anna in the Tropics'') about a young woman who travels to Spain to reconcile with her father (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; (212) 581-1212.    'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED'  Opens Monday. If you are pining for the television series ''Entourage,'' currently on hiatus, you might want to try Douglas Carter Beane's new comedy, which covers similar territory: Hollywood agent, cute movie star, tabloid gossip (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422.    Broadway    'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Jan. 17, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). (On Tuesday, Eileen Atkins will assume Ms. Jones's role, and Ron Eldard Mr. O'Byrne's.) Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION'  An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    'THE OTHER SIDE'  In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    * 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10).

Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30).

Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Van Gelder)    'FEAR ITSELF: SECRETS OF THE WHITE HOUSE' In the latest cartoonish sendup of the Bush administration, the simple task of translating ideas into dramatic form seems to have been overlooked (1:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255; closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)     * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)    'EL CARRO' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Pleasant but slight, this sociological farce from Colombia tells the story of a vintage convertible that changes the lives of the middle-class Velez family to mildly humorous effect. (Nathan Lee)    * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)    'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile.(Laura Kern)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)     'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE'  (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)     'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'INITIAL D' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Cantonese) A street-racing film based on a popular Japanese comic book, ''Initial D'' pitches swaggering Takeshi (Shawn Yue) against diffident Takumi (Jay Chou), a reluctant hero who prefers the charms of his girlfriend (Anne Suzuki) to the dangers of hairpin bends. A slick but silly affair unlikely to appeal to anyone over 15. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'THE INTRUDER' (No rating, 130 minutes, in French) The French director Claire Denis's most ambitious and poetically intuitive film explores the troubled soul of a brooding loner who undergoes a heart transplant and travels halfway around the world, from the Jura mountains to the South Seas, to begin a new life. This visually rhapsodic film is both profound and profoundly enigmatic. (Holden)     * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)    * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)    'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)    'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)    'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)      * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)    'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Lee)    'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)     'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manqué never develops any stamina. (Holden)     'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)     Film Series    ARTIST'S CHOICE: STEPHEN SONDHEIM (Through Sunday) The Museum of Modern Art's 15-film series of works chosen by Mr. Sondheim, the legendary Broadway composer and lyricist, concludes this weekend with a selection of period films. They include Truffaut's ''Story of Adele H.'' (1975); Stanley Kubrick's gorgeous romantic drama ''Barry Lyndon'' (1975); Louis Malle's sexy comic drama ''Le Voleur'' (1967); and ''I Compagni'' (1963), Mario Monicelli's drama, starring Marcello Mastroianni, about a textile factory strike. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10.

The final features include ''Vertigo'' (1958), starring James Stewart and Kim Novak; ''To Catch a Thief'' (1955), pairing Grace Kelly and Cary Grant in Monaco; the silent version of ''Blackmail'' (1929); and ''I Confess'' (1953), starring Montgomery Clift as a Québécois priest suspected of murder. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)    FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program is presenting a series of 11 feature films and 2 shorts by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82). This weekend's film is ''Love Is Colder Than Death'' (1969), a romantic triangle involving a pimp, his mistress and a man sent to kill him, shown with the 1966 short ''The Little Chaos,'' about door-to-door salesmen who turn to crime. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates)    NEW YORK JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL (Through Jan. 26) The 15th annual program opens Wednesday, sponsored by the Jewish Museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center. Opening day offers the United States premiere of Guillaume Moscovitz's ''Belzec'' (2005), a French documentary about a Polish death camp, and two New York premieres. They are Jerry Blumenthal and Gordon Quinn's ''Golub: Late Works Are the Catastrophes'' (2004), a follow-up to their first film on the artist Leon Golub, and Radu Mihaileanu's ''Live and Become'' (2005), a drama about a young boy in a Sudanese refugee camp who takes on a Jewish identity. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION (Through Feb. 6) A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. This week's films are ''Toy Story 2'' (1999) and two Oscar-winning shorts, ''Geri's Game'' (1997), about an old man playing chess, and ''For the Birds'' (2000), about a group of snobbish feathered friends. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10.

AKIM FUNK BUDDHA AND THE EBONYASIA PROJECT (Sunday) The American-born, Zimbabwe-raised Akim Ndlovu, who performs as Akim Funk Buddha, creates theatrical mash-ups involving dance, poetry, music and storytelling.

(Laura Sinagra)    ANTHRAX (Tomorrow) The amiable speed punk-metal band Anthrax had a tough time defending its name during the country's post-9/11 bout with actual anthrax. After a decade and a half of quitting and reconciliations, the original band is back in support of a greatest-hits collection. God Forbid opens. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $25. (Sinagra)    AUTORICKSHAW (Thursday) This Canadian quartet, consisting of the vocalist-pianist Suba Sankaran, the tabla player Ed Hanley, the bassist Rich Brown and the percussionist Debashis Sinha, mixes South Indian traditional sounds and Bollywood-flavored pieces with funk and jazz. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15. (Sinagra)    CHRIS BROWN (Tonight) Riding rough beats with a still discernable childlike sweetness on the single ''Run It,'' the frisky teenage R & B singer Chris Brown snags both the adult hip-hop crowd and younger fans who liked Usher's ''Yeah,'' despite not being quite sure what the lyrics were about. 8, Bergen Performing Arts Center, 30 North Van Brunt Street, Englewood, N.J., (201) 816-8160; $35 to $45. (Sinagra)    CORDERO (Tuesday) Mixing the open atmospherics of the Southwest with the gritty feel of the Brooklyn art scene, the bilingual Ani Cordero (who has worked with Calexico and Giant Sand) and her band make guitar rock that gives urban brashness some borderland mystery. 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $8. (Sinagra)    THE BUSH TETRAS, MATT SWEENEY (Monday) The Bush Tetras are no-wave luminaries whose funky punk made them downtown stars in 1980, and who are now enjoying New York's return to the sound they helped invent. The local guitarist Matt Sweeney has been in the subcultural spotlight lately because of his Superwolf collaboration with Will Oldham. 9 p.m., Lit Lounge, 93 Second Avenue, near East Fifth Street, East Village, (212) 777-7987; no cover. (Sinagra)    DAMON & NAOMI, WINGDALE COMMUNITY SINGERS (Tonight) After the bumpy breakup of the less-is-more indie-rock trio Galaxie 500, the drummer Damon Krukowski and the bassist Naomi Yang morphed into a ghostly dream-rock duo. They play tonight with the intimate, improvisatory horn players Bhob Rainey and Greg Kelley. In the Wingdale Community Singers, the atmospheric guitarist David Grubbs, the vocalist Hannah Marcus and the novelist Rick Moody get together and make literate Brooklynite folk. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; $10. (Sinagra)    DION (Monday) Dion DiMucci sang ''The Wanderer'' just as his wildest ups and downs were getting under way. His journey through the 70's and beyond involved folk-rock redirection, returns to doo-wop form, drugs, recovery and bouts of Christianity. Here he plays acoustic versions of songs by the likes of Robert Johnson, Willie Dixon and Hank Williams. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $35 (sold out).

(Sinagra)    THE DOUBLE, CELEBRATION, KYP MALONE (Tomorrow) The kaleidoscopic Double uses all the tools at its lo-fi disposal in service of arty pop undercut with burbles, dark surges and twinges. Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. Kyp Malone is a vocalist and guitarist in the spacey TV on the Radio. For years a fixture on San Francisco's underground art scene, he's been doing his own thing lately. 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $12.(Sinagra)    GREG GARING (Tonight) Greg Garing once mixed country with electronica, but he's moved steadily toward country's roots, holding on to old-fashioned, heart-on-sleeve honky-tonk. 9, Sin-é, 150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077; $10. (Jon Pareles)    REBECCA GATES (Tuesday) As the lead singer and guitarist for the spare 90's duo the Spinanes, from Portland, Ore., Rebecca Gates wrote thoughtful but driving songs made more intimate by her low, breathy vocals.

(Sinagra)    IMOGEN HEAP (Wednesday) Taking overproduced sheen to the far reaches of existential loneliness, Imogen Heap's single ''Hide and Seek'' sounds like the work of an a cappella boy band after facing off with the malevolent computer from ''2001: A Space Odyssey.''

Zoe Keating also plays. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    IOs (Tomorrow) Just like the Canadian band Stars, the iOs remind you of that exuberant 90's moment when bands like Mavis Piggott and Madder Rose made it seem that smart girl voices over big guitars were the way of the future. The iOs have a guy singer, too. But as in Stars, the female voice is the more affecting.

Army of Me also plays. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111;, $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    MUSETTE EXPLOSION (Tomorrow) Taking as inspiration the French accordion music of the 30's and 40's as well as Django Reinhardt-style jazz, Musette Explosion plays a kind of Gypsy hybrid that's different from the music of the currently proliferating Gypsy-punk scene. 6 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000; free. (Sinagra)    LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Sunday) Led by the singers Allyssa Lamb and Emily Hurst, this band mixes musicians from the United States, France and Colombia who mine their Latin heritage in the performance of boleros, cha-chas, cumbias, huaynos and cowboy songs. 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500; no cover.

(Sinagra)    SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY & THE ASBURY JUKES (Tonight and tomorrow night) While his friend Bruce Springsteen left the Jersey Shore behind and went on to write all-American anthems and parables, Southside Johnny Lyon stuck to the old bar-band basics: rolling R & B vamps and raspy-voiced, good-natured soul plaints, complete with horn section. 8, B.

(Sinagra)    WE ARE SCIENTISTS, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Thursday) The pointy guitars and firecracker drums of this local band propel the tremulous pleas of Keith Murray into a full-on lust panic. Where similar bands like Hot Hot Heat can sound too studied, We Are Scientists makes its precise parts seem inspired. The trio Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic forebears like the Embarrassment. Bishop Allen and the Kites also play. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 (sold out).

(Chinen)    MICHAEL BISIO (Tonight) The physicality of Mr. Bisio's bass playing puts him in touch with numerous predecessors in the avant-garde, but his expressive touch is distinctive; he plays an early set with a quartet featuring the saxophonist Avram Fefer, and a later set in trio with the pianist Matthew Shipp and the drummer Jay Rosen. 8 and 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    BUSHWACKED (Wednesday) The title of this avant-garde oratorio by the saxophonist Mark Whitecage provides a good indication of its political bent and degree of subtlety; the piece's New York premiere will feature Roy Campbell Jr. on trumpet and vocals, Rozanne Levine on clarinet, Joe Fonda on bass and Jay Rosen on drums. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.

(Chinen)    THE MUSIC OF TOMMY FLANAGAN AND MILT JACKSON (Tuesday through Jan. 15) Tommy Flanagan and Milt Jackson were, respectively, a grippingly erudite pianist and a sophisticatedly bluesy vibraphonist; this tribute features the worthy inheritors Renee Rosnes and Steve Nelson on piano and vibes, and the sterling rhythm team of Peter Washington and Lewis Nash on bass and drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.(Chinen)    THE FOUR BAGS (Sunday) The instrumental palette of this collaborative quartet -- trombone, accordion, guitar and reeds -- creates the impression of a contemporary chamber jazz; so does the repertory, which includes arrangements of Chopin and Brian Wilson, along with thoughtful original compositions. 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.

(Chinen)    JOHN HEBERT QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Hebert, a bassist with experimental tendencies and compositional ambitions, leads a versatile group with the guitarist John Abercrombie, the tenor saxophonist Adam Kolker and the drummer Bob Meyer. 10 p.m., Detour, 349 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 533-6212; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Thursday) This improvising chamber ensemble pursues texturally oriented and often contrapuntal exploration; Mr. Hollenbeck's drumming is one color on a palette that also includes Chris Speed's clarinet and tenor saxophone, Ted Reichman's accordion and Matt Moran's vibraphone. They share their billing with Jazz Big Band Graz, an accomplished group from Austria. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10 and one-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    MAT MANERI GROUP (Thursday) On the recent album ''Pentagon'' (Thirsty Ear), the violinist and violist Mat Maneri plugged into electric fusion without forsaking the tenor and thrust of free-jazz; he reprises those explorations in a group featuring his father, Joe Maneri, on reeds, along with Jacob Sacks on piano, John Hebert on bass and Gerald Cleaver and John McLellan on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $10 per set. (Chinen)    ANDY MILNE AND DAPP THEORY (Sunday and Wednesday) With Dapp Theory, the keyboardist Andy Milne fashions a contemporary fusion explicitly indebted to hip-hop; his band includes Loren Stillman on saxophones, Janek Gwizdala on bass, Sean Rickman on drums and John Moon on percussion and spoken word. Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum; no cover for students with ID.

(Chinen)    BOB MINTZER BIG BAND (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Mintzer, a saxophonist and decade-long member of the Yellowjackets, has led this 16-piece outfit for roughly the same span; it's a brightly brassy ensemble with a modernistic sheen. 8 and 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    BEN MONDER TRIO (Tuesday) In the hands of Mr. Monder, the electric guitar is a coloristic instrument first and foremost; his fine recent album, ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), showcases both his dizzyingly proficient solo puzzles and his coolly convoluted pieces for trio. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    JAMES MOODY QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Like his mentor, Dizzy Gillespie, the alto saxophonist James Moody is a stalwart bebopper and one of jazz's most ebullient entertainers; he leads a solid group consisting of the pianist Renee Rosnes, the bassist Todd Coolman and the drummer Adam Nussbaum. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    A TRIBUTE TO DANNY MOORE (Tonight and tomorrow) The trumpeter Danny Moore, who died last February, was the quintessential musician's musician. Fittingly, this tribute features players with similar reputations: the tenor saxophonist George Coleman, the pianist Anthony Wonsey, the drummer Joe Farnsworth and the bassist John Webber. 9 and 11 p.m., and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    JOE MORRIS TRIO WITH KEN VANDERMARK (Tuesday) Mr. Morris is a guitarist who applies the clear tone of Jim Hall to darker and pricklier purposes; he performs here with another uncompromising explorer, the multireedist Ken Vandermark, and a frequent collaborator, the drummer Luther Gray. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)    * NYC JAZZ ALTERNATIVES: THE NEW GENERATION (Wednesday) This one-night mini-festival rounds up half a dozen groups from the margins of jazz culture: Gutbucket, a raucous jam band; Rashanim, an avant-garde klezmer group; Okkyung Lee, an adventurous cellist; a pair of trios led by the pianist Benny Lackner and the trombonist Jacob Garchik; and a plugged-in sextet led by the trumpeter Shane Endsley. It won't be a survey of jazz's new generation so much as a series of snapshots, intriguing and inconclusive. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen)    GRETCHEN PARLATO (Tonight and Monday) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a recent deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, underscored here by a deep rapport with the guitarist Lionel Loueke. Tonight at 6,, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. Monday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $15. (Chinen)    JEREMY PELT QUARTET (Thursday) The clarion tone and preternatural poise of Mr. Pelt's trumpet playing have earmarked him as a rising star in the jazz mainstream; as on his recent album ''Identity'' (MaxJazz), he plays here with the pianist Frank LoCrasto, the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer Eric McPherson. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)    RE: ARRANGED: THE MUSIC OF JACO PASTORIUS, GIL EVANS, LENNON & McCARTNEY (Tuesday through Jan. 15) The sweep of this project, which clearly runs the risk of incoherence, could be a perfect challenge for the pianist and accordionist Gil Goldstein, one of the most resourceful arrangers in jazz today. Just as promising is the lineup, featuring the trumpeter Randy Brecker, the saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, the bassist Richard Bona, the percussionist Don Alias and an improvising string trio led by the violinist Joyce Hammann. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    * KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Tuesday through Jan. 15) Mr. Rosenwinkel is almost certainly the most widely hailed jazz guitarist under 40, especially among musicians; his deeply sympathetic rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner provides the focal point of this shadowy and slippery ensemble, which also includes Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Eric Harland on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    LOREN STILLMAN QUARTET (Wednesday) With his recent album, ''It Could Be Anything'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), Mr. Stillman reinforces his reputation as an alto saxophonist with an inquisitive relationship to jazz tradition; he performs here with Jacob Sacks on piano, Scott Lee on bass and Jeff Hirschfield on drums. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    STEVE WILSON QUARTET WITH NICHOLAS PAYTON (Through Sunday) An alto saxophonist with a dry tone but a rounded sense of phrase, Mr. Wilson recruits a well-established rhythm section -- Bruce Barth on piano, Ed Howard on bass and Adam Cruz on drums -- and locks horns with Mr. Payton, one of the outstanding trumpeters of our time. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20 and $25. (Chinen)    Classical  Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow) The good news of the Met's revival of its 1991 production of Donizetti's ''Elixir of Love'' is the entrancing performance of Ruth Ann Swenson as Adina. Some opera buffs have long found Ms. Swenson's work vocally exquisite but temperamentally bland. Here she brings a breezy comic grace to the role of a wealthy young landowner in an Italian village who thinks herself immune to sentimental notions about love, until the painfully shy peasant Nemorino gets through to her. Ms. Swenson sings with her trademark creamy sound, effortful richness and impressive agility. The tenor Ramón Vargas is an ardent and endearing Nemorino. Maurizio Barbacini conducts. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini)    'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow) Most stagings of Strauss's ever-popular operetta, including some revivals of the Met's 1986 Otto Schenk production, seem uncomfortable with the mix of silliness and cynicism in the story of playful infidelities in 1870's Vienna. But the Metropolitan Opera's current presentation boasts a winning cast of singers who, for the most part, take the story seriously and give subtle portrayals, especially Bo Skovhus as the ladies' man Eisenstein, Sondra Radvanovsky as his knowing wife, Marlis Petersen as the perky chambermaid and Earle Patriarco as the wily Dr. Falke. Jacques Lacombe conducts a lithe and fresh performance. And with the comedic actor Bill Irwin as the drunken jailor Frosch, the show has plenty of hilarity. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220. (Tommasini)    'H.M.S. PINAFORE,' 'THE MIKADO' (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players are a small city institution in their own right, dedicated to presenting polished light-opera performances. Two of the most popular are this winter's fare, as well as a concert of other highlights on Thursday night. ''Pinafore,'' tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 2 p.m.; ''Mikado,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., and Tuesday at 7 p.m.; ''Quintessential G&S'' concert, Thursday at 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212; $40 to $86. (Anne Midgette)    'WOZZECK' (Tonight) Alban Berg's bleak atonal opera may not strike many people as quite the thing to usher in the New Year. But James Levine is a masterly interpreter of this musically stunning and dramatically compelling work, which he keeps bringing back to the Met in a noble effort to make ''Wozzeck'' essential to the company's repertory. With Mark Lamos's arrestingly abstract 1997 production and an inspired cast led by Alan Held in the title role, this revival should be seen by all serious opera fans. Mr. Levine elicits a searingly beautiful performance from the great Met orchestra. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $205. (Tommasini)    Classical Music    AVALON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) This young quartet offers the first of its two ''Romantic Frontiers'' concerts (the second is on Jan. 14).

(Allan Kozinn)    JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its idiosyncratic founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and familiar works. The ensemble and its guests -- including Mikhail Kopelman, the former first violinist of the Borodin String Quartet, and his daughter, Elizaveta Kopelman, a pianist -- perform Grieg's Movement in C minor, Elgar's ''Harmony Music 5'' and a Rimsky-Korsakov piano trio. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259; $10 to $25. (Kozinn)    MET ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Three realms of the soprano Renée Fleming's repertory are explored in this concert by the Met Orchestra, with James Levine conducting. She sings the ''Letter Scene'' from Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' the closing scene from Strauss's ''Capriccio'' and, of special interest, the harmonically murky and expressionistic ''Altenberg Lieder'' of Alban Berg. Mr. Levine also offers performances of Tchaikovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet'' fantasy overture and Wagner's Overture and Bacchanale from ''Tannhäuser.'' 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $46 to $155. (Tommasini)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) The young Canadian violinist James Ehnes joins Lorin Maazel and the New York Philharmonic to play Walton's sumptuous and too rarely heard Violin Concerto at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and at Avery Fisher Hall. On Thursday, the superb English conductor Jonathan Nott takes over, leading a program that includes Strauss's ''Alpine Symphony'' and John Corigliano's ''Red Violin,'' a 2003 concerto based on themes from Mr. Corigliano's score for the film ''The Red Violin.'' Joshua Bell, for whom the piece was composed, is the soloist. Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $27 to $92. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $99. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC ENSEMBLES (Sunday) Members of the Philharmonic have one of their periodic chamber-music gatherings in an offbeat program of Bridge, Prokofiev, Enescu, Diamond and Françaix. 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $29. (Bernard Holland)    RICHARD TUCKER FOUNDATION GALA (Wednesday) Perhaps responding to the increase of cancellations by big-name singers in past seasons, the annual Tucker gala has downsized this year, moving from Avery Fisher Hall to Alice Tully Hall and focusing less on superstars than on rising young talents. Not that they're unknown quantities: most, like Laquita Mitchell, Jennifer Aylmer, Carolyn Betty and Jordan Bisch, have active performing schedules. The master of ceremonies is Denyce Graves, while the tenor Matthew Polenzani makes a belated appearance to compensate for the fact that he couldn't attend the gala in 2004, the year he won the foundation award. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $75 and $100.

(Dunning)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Today through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) It's all ''Swan Lake'' all the time this week, except for a mixed-bill program tomorrow night. Peter Martins's version of this ornithological classic is well worth seeing, and the casts will shift throughout the run. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8.; tomorrow afternoon at 2; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, www.nycballet.com; $30 to $86. (Rockwell)    SUNDAYS @ THREE: CALPULLI MEXICAN DANCE COMPANY (Sunday) This informal performance and discussion series will feature a young troupe performing traditional Mexican dance and music and Aztec and Spanish dance forms. 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $10. (Dunning)    CASSIE TERMAN AND SHINICHI MOMO KOGA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Known as the Fred Astaire of Butoh, Mr. Koga will perform ''The Smallest Country,'' a program of improvised duets, with Ms. Terman, who trained in physical theater with Ruth Zaporah. 8, CRS, 123 Fourth Avenue, between 12th and 13th Streets, East Village, (212) 352-3101; $12. (Dunning)    Art  Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    ASIA SOCIETY: 'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -- THE ART OF DINH Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age and the global consumerist economy. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'EDWARD BURTYNSKY: MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    CHELSEA ART MUSEUM: 'THE BODY IMAGE IN CRISTÓBAL GABARRÓN'S ART, 1963-2005,' through Jan. 14. A member of the mid-20th-century European Informal art movement based on mentally improvised rather than formal motifs, this Spanish artist is concerned with the body, but not in its traditional manifestations. His abstractions and semiabstractions give it a morphing, metaphysical presence; sometimes they involve the depiction of actual body parts, but they rely more on textures, colors and vague forms to evoke the body's ever-shifting sense of itself. But for all the blustery vigor on display, the work gives the viewer a powerful sense of been-there-seen-that. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719.(Grace Glueck)    * COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Roberta Smith)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AFRICAN-AMERICAN VERNACULAR PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Johnson)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer who incorporates into his work artifacts he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Glueck)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)      * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck)    * MET: ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: 'COMBINES,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: BEYOND THE VISIBLE: 'THE ART OF ODILON REDON,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neoconceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. (See above.) (Smith)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what Latino art means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter)    NEUE GALERIE: 'EGON SCHIELE: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)        * RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS IT? HIMALAYAN ART,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman)     Galleries: Uptown     CHARLES BIEDERMAN: 'WORKS FROM THE 30'S' One of the most interestingly maverick and talented of between-the-wars American Modernists, Biederman left New York in 1942 for Minnesota, where he continued to make art and write art theory until his death in 2004. This small exhibition of biomorphic abstract paintings and one glossy construction of squares and knobs from the 1930's shows what an excellent student of European Surrealism and Constructivism he was. Meredith Ward, 60 East 66th Street, (212) 744-7306, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. This substantial exhibition of works on paper extends the full-scale Bluemner retrospective now at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street     * SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    GERHARD RICHTER This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    'STRUCTURE' Hardly any artist today takes geometry as seriously as certain American Modernists did, following the lead of Mondrian in the mid-20th century. So this well-produced show of geometric relief sculptures by Ilya Bolotowsky, Nikolai Kasak and Charles Biederman, among others, comes as a nice surprise. Eli Bornstein's truly beautiful, neatly gridded constructions of floating wood blocks painted lovely confectionery colors are alone worth the trip. Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea     MARINA ABRAMOVIC: 'BALKAN EROTIC EPIC' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)     ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    NOBUYOSHI ARAKI, 'PAINTING FLOWER AND DIARIES' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    * TAMY BEN-TOR, 'EXPLORATION IN THE DOMAIN OF IDIOCY' On video -- and live on Friday and Saturday afternoons -- a wonderfully talented comic performance artist creates hilariously self-absorbed characters. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    MIKI CARMI: 'PSYCHIC READYMADES' This young Israeli-born painter makes strangely creepy pictures of oversize bald heads based on those of elderly members of his family. He lavishes painterly attention on veins, age spots, baggy eyes, wrinkles and drooping lips, and he floats the heads like weird balloons against white backgrounds. The paintings are far from beautiful, but their unsettling impact feels right for the often confusing roles that elders play in our psychic lives. Stux, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    MATTHEW MCCASLIN This inventive sculptor plays with the tension between nature and technology. A working fountain has water flowing from sunflowers made of wide showerheads and copper pipe planted in a claw-foot bathtub. And the arrangement of a cuckoo clock and a flat-screen video view of peaceful lake waters on a natural plywood wall slyly enhances the faux-rustic ambience. Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    GORDON MOORE Elegantly understated paintings animated by ghostly linear figures and their shadows, which gambol before the large-paned grid of -- well, maybe a factory window. Composed of lines of different lengths and colors and various thicknesses, these antic figures seem to vibrate on and under the paintings' lightly brushed surfaces. Mr. Moore rings many intricate variations on his basic format, which, while it commits to the visible, manages to engage the mystery of what lies beyond it. Betty Cuningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through Jan. 28. (Glueck)    NICHOLAS NIXON: 'LIFE AND TIMES' Among other photographs from the last 30 years, this show features Mr. Nixon's famous ''Brown Sisters,'' a set of group portraits of four sisters made annually, starting in 1975. It is almost painfully touching to see the beautiful siblings evolve from teenagers to late middle age. And then you begin to wonder how long this can go on before one of the five participants will no longer be available. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)    ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)    * JIM DRAIN AND ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy, 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending on a ladder into a kind of rabbit hole. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    SUZAN FRECON An accomplished abstract painter presents a serene installation of six large works -- three grid-based and three featuring simple, curvy shapes -- all in deep, rich reds, blues and greens. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'MONUMENTS FOR THE USA' The critic Ralph Rugoff invited more than 50 artists to submit proposals for a never-to-be-built national monument. All the proposals, mostly illustrative works on paper ranging in spirit from scathingly critical to earnestly visionary, are presented by this entertaining if not especially profound exhibition. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 924-4212, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)    Last Chance    ABETZ/DRESCHER The Berlin-based collaborators Maike Abetz and Oliver Drescher paint large, busily detailed pictures of Renaissance ruins densely populated by fashion models, broken guitars, televisions and naked figures from pagan myth in a style you might call psychedelic pre-Raphaelite. Though not impressive formally or technically, they do capture a certain wildly eclectic and deeply narcissistic state of youthful consciousness. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-0461, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)     * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!' This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600, closing Wednesday. (Smith)    * FRANCO MONDINI-RUIZ: QUATTROCENTO In a bit of performative art-making that sends up art-world preciousness with intimations of tourist souvenirs, the 400 paintings here are seductive, portable, priced to sell ($400) and sometimes made on the spot. Also good, at Envoy, a gallery that shares the Taylor space, is the New York debut of Nils Erik Gjerdevik, a young Norwegian artist who cannibalizes snippets from Art Nouveau to graffiti into playfully calligraphic designs. Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646) 230-0992; Envoy, (212) 242-7524; both closing tomorrow. (Smith)     * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ELIZABETH MURRAY' Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) Closing Monday. (Kimmelman)    * THE MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'LASTING FOUNDATIONS: THE ART OF ARCHITECTURE IN AFRICA' Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700, closing today. (Cotter)    ANNYSA NG: 'LOVE & FEAR' A beautiful new gallery occupying two floors of a tiny brick house presents works of postmodernist faux-antiquity by a Chinese artist who has studied in Hong Kong, New York and Germany. The large, Victorian-style silhouettes are not without possibilities, though perhaps they are too Kara Walker-like; the hanging assemblages made of braided hair, fabric and found objects have an erotically stirring poetic delicacy. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-9093, closing Tuesday. (Johnson)    RICHARD POUSETTE-DART: 'PRESENCES: THE IMPLODING OF COLOR' Though routinely associated with Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart had metaphysical and symbolist interests that distinguished him from better-known members of that group. In the 1960's and 70's, he turned to what you could call Pointillist Color Field Painting, and though the sensuous impact of light, color and thickly stippled paint is strongly asserted, the works are also animated by intimations of cosmic mysticism. Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    'RUSSIA 2: BAD NEWS FROM RUSSIA' An entertaining, congested and abrasive exhibition presents stridently and antically political contemporary works by 15 individuals and groups who live and work in Russia. White Box, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-2347; and the Annex, 601 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (646) 638-3785; closing Wednesday. (Johnson)     FELIX SCHRAMM: 'COMBER' It looks as if a tornado ripped parts off an ordinary house and slammed them into the gallery, creating a Cubist-Expressionist-style environment that was, in fact, carefully designed and assembled by this young and innovative German sculptor. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-2388, closing tomorrow.

Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'ALMOST, MAINE' Opens Jan. 12. A comedy consisting of 11 episodes, which all take place at 9 p.m. on a Friday, about love and heartbreak in a cold town in Maine (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200.    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' Opens Jan. 10. The New York premiere of a new play by Nilo Cruz (''Anna in the Tropics'') about a young woman who travels to Spain to reconcile with her father (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212.    'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Opens Jan. 9. If you are pining for the television series ''Entourage,'' currently on hiatus, you might want to try Douglas Carter Beane's new comedy, which covers similar territory: Hollywood agent, cute movie star, tabloid gossip (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    Broadway    'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) (On Jan. 17, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) (On Jan. 10, Eileen Atkins will assume Ms. Jones's role and Ron Eldard Mr. O'Byrne's.)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'APPARITION' Anne Washburn's gothic shorts are like an excellent late-night storytelling session at the Vincent Price camp for disturbed children (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Jason Zinoman)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION'  An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    'THE OTHER SIDE'  In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'FEAR ITSELF: SECRETS OF THE WHITE HOUSE' In the latest cartoonish sendup of the Bush administration, the simple task of translating ideas into dramatic form seems to have been overlooked (1:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-0255. (Zinoman)    * 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, though not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Neil Genzlinger)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' Spirited entertainment (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is pleasantly fluffy, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way, but lots of laughs (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'HIS ROYAL HIPNESS LORD BUCKLEY IN THE ZAM ZAM ROOM' Jake Broder's scrupulous (and rigid) re-creation of the influential nightclub comic Lord Buckley, an unlikely mix of English royalty and Dizzy Gillespie (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman).    'LATINOLOGUES'  In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    *'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' The joyous surprise of this Shakespeare's Globe production, directed by John Dove, is how it floods this famously dark play with continuously roaming beams of comic light. In particular, Mark Rylance, the troupe's departing artistic director, is an endearingly clueless Duke Vincentio (3:05). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but all others will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    'PETER PAN'  Entertaining without being exhilarating (2:00). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, 4 Penn Plaza, closing tomorrow. (212) 307-7171. (Van Gelder)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000, closing Monday. (Van Gelder)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'TIGHT EMBRACE'  Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas's political hostage drama wants to show, with its dash of magic realism and flickering poetic fire, how human beings use language as a weapon to betray one another. Good acting, especially by Zabryna Guevara, helps the play toward its goal (2:00). Intar Theater at the Kirk on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Monday. (Andrea Stevens)    'WAITING FOR GODOT' (2:30). In this solid production, it is Sam Coppola (Vladimir) and Joseph Ragno (Estragon) who are waiting for the world's most famous no-show. It's been 50 years since Samuel Beckett's play was first staged on Broadway, and the changes in the world since then give the never-changing world of Didi and Gogo some interesting new resonance. Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AEON FLUX' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Adapted from MTV animated shorts from a decade ago, this glossy, incoherent movie sends Charlize Theron 400 years into the future, where she runs around and does somersaults in a spandex body suit. (A. O. Scott)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)    * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (Scott)    * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)    'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, which is also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile. (Laura Kern)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)    'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE'  (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)    'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warmhearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'INITIAL D' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Cantonese) A street-racing film based on a popular Japanese comic book, ''Initial D'' pitches swaggering Takeshi (Shawn Yue) against diffident Takumi (Jay Chou), a reluctant hero who prefers the charms of his girlfriend (Anne Suzuki) to the dangers of hairpin bends. A slick but silly affair unlikely to appeal to anyone over 15. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'THE INTRUDER' (No rating, 130 minutes, in French) The French director Claire Denis's most ambitious and poetically intuitive film explores the troubled soul of a brooding loner who undergoes a heart transplant and travels halfway around the world, from the Jura mountains to the South Seas, to begin a new life. This visually rhapsodic film is both profound and profoundly enigmatic. (Holden)    * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old, seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)    * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)    'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)    'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)    'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Nathan Lee)    'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manqué never develops any stamina. (Holden)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    ARTIST'S CHOICE: STEPHEN SONDHEIM (Through Jan. 8) The Museum of Modern Art's 15-film series of works selected by Mr. Sondheim, the legendary Broadway composer and lyricist, continues.

THE BLACK CROWES, TREY ANASTASIO, THE NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALL-STARS (Tomorrow) Jam bands have long claimed New Year's Eve at Madison Square Garden. This triple bill looks toward Southern rock jams with the reunited Black Crowes, whose raspy-voiced frontman, Chris Robinson, brings a rare touch of charisma to the jam scene, and the North Mississippi All-Stars, who build their jams on the idiosyncratic riffs of blues learned at the source. Trey Anastasio's old band, Phish, used to headline New Year's Eve shows at the Garden; now, he's back with his new one. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $45 to $65. (Laura Sinagra)    BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tomorrow) Boasting zero members from Brazil and only one girl (the multilingual surrealist jazz singer Sabina Sciubba), this downtown quartet, smithied in the arty Nublu club scene, plays its erotic, electronica-inflected reggae and bossa novas on keyboards, computers, bass and drums. 8 p.m. and midnight, Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $50 in advance, $75 at the door. (Sinagra)    MARIAH CAREY (Tomorrow) If cramming your body into a two-block radius with a crowd of thousands to watch a glowing ball drop is the only thing that will start your year off right, you may also catch a few notes from the pop R&B star Mariah Carey, whose appearance will be the first live music performance by a singer on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. 11:30 p.m., Times Square, free. (Sinagra)    CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH, THE NATIONAL, DR. DOG (Tomorrow) The Brooklyn quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah recalls the shamanic whine and thrum of the mid-1990's lo-fi rockers Neutral Milk Hotel, and sometimes the slippery paranoid quirk of the Talking Heads. The National is a group of New York-based Ohio natives who turn out a kind of pent-up, countrified indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. Shaggy Philly lo-fi rockers Dr. Dog open. 9:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Related article, Page 1 of Weekend.) (Sinagra)    GOV'T MULE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Gov't Mule's guitarist and leader, Warren Haynes, brings the gravity of the blues and the rolling grooves of Southern rock together with the bleary determination of grunge. His songs are haunted by death and memory, and he leads them into jams that can be both soaring and unsparing. 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; tonight, $39.50 to $59.50; tomorrow, $53.50 to $73.50.

(Sinagra)    HOLLADAY JAM TOUR (Tonight) This collection of R&B hitmakers skews to the twitchy teenage side of the genre. Performers include Bow Wow (who has dropped his diminutive ''L'il''), the up-and-coming youngster Chris Brown and the singers Omarion and Ciara, posited as a new Aaliyah, a singer who could ride hip-hop beats with a conspiratorial, low-key urgency. Also appearing will be Dem Franchize Boys, Marques (Batman) Houston and Trey Songz. 7 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.75 to $54.75. (Sinagra)    JAMES HUNTER (Thursday) The English soul singer James Hunter aims for a sound that draws on the influences of Sam Cooke and Van Morrison. 7 p.m., the Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; $5 suggested donation. (Sinagra)    JORDAN KNIGHT, JEFF TIMMONS (Thursday) This pairing unites two former boy-band cuties, New Kids on the Block's Jordan Knight -- a strong singer who hasn't enjoyed a post-Kids success equal to that of the later boy-band heir Justin Timberlake -- and 98 Degrees's Jeff Timmons, who just might be better off than his more famous former bandmate and soon-to-be Jessica Simpson's ex-hubby, Nick Lachey. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance; $50 V.I.P. ticket (includes entry into the room at 6 p.m. and an autographed poster).

(Sinagra)    LITTLE STEVEN'S UNDERGROUND GARAGE: ESPN NEW YEAR'S EVE (Tomorrow) This expensive event makes strange bedfellows of wispy hipsters and the ESPN rock 'n' jock crowd. The price includes dinner, drinks and performances by the longstanding bluesy garage-rockers the Chesterfield Kings and the seminal genre progenitors the Troggs, along with their like-minded heirs, the Mooney Suzuki and the Woggles. The night's big draw will be the reunited glam-punk godfathers the New York Dolls. The radio host, television star and rocker Little Steven is the host of this weird, sweaty amalgam, along with the animated ESPN anchor Stuart Scott. 8:30 p.m. to 2 a.m., Hard Rock Cafe, 1501 Broadway, at 43rd Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $300. (Sinagra)    THE JUAN MaCLEAN (Tonight) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco ornamented by clang and mooglike warps.

(Sinagra)    PRINCESS SUPERSTAR (Tomorrow) The cheeky, ironic trash-rapper Princess Superstar, whose songs about the joys of juvenile delinquency, like ''Bad Babysitter,'' gained her a reputation as the female Eminem, plays DJ and host at this hipster New Year's Eve bash, which may feature pop-in performances by other acts as well. 9 p.m., Delancey, 168 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-9920; $15 in advance, $20.

(Sinagra)    PATTI SMITH AND HER BAND (Tonight and tomorrow) The punk poet rocker Patti Smith still has the sinewy swagger to trump young imitators. This fall's performances of her classic ''Horses'' album showed that her raging middle-aged band members Lenny Kaye and Jay Dee Daugherty can still scare the hipsters into doing an angular approximation of the alligator. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; tonight, $40 (sold out); tomorrow, $55.

(Sinagra)    ULRICH SCHNAUSS (Tonight) Ulrich Schnauss of Berlin piqued interest in 2001 with ''Far Away Trains Passing By'' (City Centre Offices), a weird mix of shoe-gazer dreaminess and the electronica of the moment. Since then, he has moved even further in that direction, inspired by the likes of My Bloody Valentine as much as by techno. Tonight, Mahogany, Project Skyward and Autumn Thieves also play. 7, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Sinagra)    VODOU DRUMS OF HAITI (Tomorrow) This group of drummers and rhythmic dancers led by Bonga Jean-Baptiste, a former member of the Haitian voodoo-rock band Boukman Eksperyans, performs in a more ritualistic, spiritually inspired Afro-Haitian style. 10 p.m., Zebulon Cafe Concert, 258 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; free. (Sinagra)    THE WOOD BROTHERS (Thursday) The Wood Brothers are Oliver and Chris Wood, musical siblings reared in the Northwest, whose divergent paths led Oliver to blues rock bands in Atlanta, and Chris to New York, where he ended up in Medeski, Martin & Wood.

(Holden)    * Andrea Marcovicci (Tonight, and Tuesday through Thursday) In her spellbinding retrospective ''I'll Be Seeing You  Love Songs of World War II,'' Ms. Marcovicci balances nostalgia for songs associated with ''the good war'' with acknowledgment of the real pain and sacrifice that inspired so many of them, providing a dusting of reality. On Tuesday she begins a new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire.'' 9 p.m., with a late show at 11:30 tonight, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $65 cover; $60 Tuesday through Thursday, with a required $60 prix-fixe dinner at the early shows Wednesday and Thursday, and a $20 minimum on Tuesday and at the late shows.

(Holden)    STEVE TYRELL (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Tyrell has one of those where-have-I-heard-it-before growls that sounds great on a movie soundtrack, but loses its charm in a club, as he rolls standards off the assembly line as if they were all the same song. 8:45 and 10:45 tonight, 11 and 1:30 a.m. tomorrow for New Year's Eve, with dinner served at 8. Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100 tonight; $500 tomorrow, including dinner, Champagne toast at midnight, party favors and a bottle of Champagne Taittinger; the late show tomorrow night is free to those who attend the early show; it has a $95 cover otherwise.

RALPH ALESSI/TIM BERNE/SHANE ENDSLEY (Wednesday) Mr. Alessi and Mr. Endsley, both trumpeters, and Mr. Berne, a saxophonist, each have a distinctive take on contemporary avant-gardism; their collaborative method doesn't suggest a middle ground so much as a common language. 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)    GATO BARBIERI (Through Sunday) This Argentinean saxophonist, best known for his theme to the film ''Last Tango in Paris,'' brings his dramatic atmospherics to the vicinity of Times Square; prices will soar on New Year's Eve, but hopefully so will the music. 8 and 10 tonight and Sunday, 8 and 11 p.m. tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum tonight and Sunday; $55 to $95, with a $20 to $25 minimum tomorrow night.

(Chinen)    * PAQUITO D'RIVERA AND PANAMERICANA (Through Sunday) Few musicians have a better claim to pan-Americana than Paquito D'Rivera, the clarinetist, saxophonist and longtime Cuban exile who toured extensively with Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra.

In addition to Mr. Ribot's bracing electric guitar, the group features the athletic bass playing of Henry Grimes, the tart pocket trumpet and fat flugelhorn of Roy Campbell and the insistent drumming of Chad Taylor. 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $20. (Chinen)    PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tuesday) Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist with a cool tone and a thoughtfully off-kilter sensibility, leads an ensemble consisting of Sam Sadigursky on tenor and soprano saxophones, Ryan Blotnick on guitar, Thomas Morgan on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $6, with a one-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    JAMIE SAFT BLUES EXPLOSION (Thursday) Mr. Saft is a keyboardist given to abstraction and mystery, but he's not averse to nestling into a groove; both impulses should be satisfied by this band, with the drummer Bobby Previte and the bassist Jonathan Maron. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10.

(Chinen)    * CASSANDRA WILSON (Through Sunday) A jazz singer by training and temperament, Ms. Wilson takes obvious pleasure in a genre-blind repertory; she has the right accompanists, including Brandon Ross and Marvin Sewell on guitars, Grégoire Maret on harmonica and Reginald Veal on bass. On New Year's Eve, Ms. Wilson will play a special double bill with the guitarist Alvin Youngblood Hart, for a special price. 8 and 10:30 tonight and Sunday night, 7 and 10 p.m. tomorrow, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $55 at tables, $35 at the bar, with a $5 minimum tonight and Sunday; $85 at tables, $55 at the bar tomorrow at 7 p.m.; $125 at tables, $85 at the bar tomorrow at 10 p.m..

(Chinen)    * JOHN ZORN'S HEMOPHILIAC AND ELECTRIC MASADA (Tomorrow) Cacophony is always celebratory in John Zorn's universe, and this New Year's Eve celebration should live up to its promise. The early set begins with Hemophiliac (Mr. Zorn on alto saxophone, Mike Patton on vocals and Ikue Mori on electronics) and moves on to Electric Masada (the aforementioned plus a half-dozen others, including the drummer Joey Baron and the guitarist Marc Ribot). A second set features Electric Masada exclusively. 7 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $60 each set. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Monday) The Met is bringing back its colorful John Copley production of Donizetti's delightful romantic comedy about a shy Tuscan country bumpkin who, thanks to a quack doctor who sells him a love potion (in truth, a bottle of wine), is emboldened to approach the girl he pines for from afar. The cast looks strong, with the ardent tenor Ramón Vargas and the splendid soprano Ruth Ann Swenson in the leading roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)    'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Most stagings of Strauss's ever popular operetta, including some revivals of the Met's 1986 Otto Schenk production, seem uncomfortable with the mix of silliness and cynicism in the story of playful infidelities in 1870's Vienna. But the Met's current presentation boasts a winning cast of singers who, for the most part, take the story seriously and give subtle portrayals, especially Bo Skovhus as the ladies' man Gabriel von Eisenstein, Sondra Radvanovsky as his knowing wife, Marlis Petersen as the perky chambermaid Adele and Earle Patriarco as the wily Dr. Falke. Jacques Lacombe conducts a lithe and bracing performance. And with the masterly comedic actor Bill Irwin as the drunken jailer Frosch, the show has plenty of hilarity. Those attending the New Year's Eve gala performance can count on surprise guests showing up to sing during the party scene in Act II. (There will be several cast changes for Wednesday's performance.) Tomorrow night at 7 and Wednesday night at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $50 to $250 tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini)    'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Tonight and Thursday) Sometimes, late in the run of a production at the Met, the changes in casting can get a little dizzying. Such is the case for the final two performances this season of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' starting tonight. There will be a new Lucia, the established Korean soprano Youngok Shin. The young Italian tenor Giuseppe Filianoti, who made an impressive Met debut earlier in the run as Lucia's beloved Edgardo, returns to the cast to sing the role tonight. But Ramón Vargas, a veteran bel canto tenor, takes over on Thursday. Edoardo Müller, who has been conducting the revolving-door ''Lucia'' casts all along, provides some consistency on the podium. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205. (Tommasini)    'WOZZECK' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Alban Berg's bleak atonal opera may not strike many people as quite the thing to usher in the New Year. But James Levine is a masterly interpreter of this musically stunning and dramatically compelling work, which he keeps bringing back to the Met in a noble effort to make ''Wozzeck'' essential to the company's repertory. With Mark Lamos's arrestingly abstract 1997 production and an inspired cast headed by Alan Held in the title role, this revival should be seen by all serious opera fans. Mr. Levine elicits a searingly beautiful performance from the great Met orchestra. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Tommasini)    Classical    BACHWORKS (Tomorrow) Over the last decade, traversals of Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concertos have joined Handel's ''Messiah'' as seasonal favorites. Don't let the fact that the works have no historical connection to the holidays worry you; neither does ''Messiah,'' which was composed for performances around Easter. Anthony Newman leads the BachWorks ensemble in these six great compositions. 8 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248; $35 to $100; $20 for students and 65+. (Allan Kozinn)    GILBERT AND SULLIVAN GALA (Tomorrow) The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, experts in the repertory of their namesakes, usher out 2005 in the spirit of lightheartedness, parody and sheer silliness, with an evening of scenes and songs from the Savoyard canon. In addition to the planned excerpts, the troupe, supported by a full orchestra, will take audience requests. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $55 to $75. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) The German violinist Julia Fischer says that the second movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto reminds her of Lensky's aria from ''Eugene Onegin.'' Hearing her make that link in her performance should be enlightening. The program also includes a rarity, the Weber Bassoon Concerto, with Judith LeClair as the soloist, and Lorin Maazel's reading of the Sibelius Fifth Symphony. That program straddles the New Year's weekend, but for New Year's Eve, Mr. Maazel and company are joined by the soprano Angela Gheorghiu for an evening of Italian opera arias. On Thursday, the young Canadian violinist James Ehnes is the soloist in Walton's sumptuous Violin Concerto. Lorin Maazel also conducts Wagner's ''Flying Dutchman'' Overture and the Dvorak Seventh Symphony. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94, except $80 to $235 tomorrow. (Kozinn)    WILLIAM TRAFKA (Tomorrow) Mr. Trafka, the organist and music director at St. Bartholomew's Church, plans to while away the final hour of 2005 playing works by Bach, Widor, Langlais, Handel, Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky, with Copland's ''Fanfare for the Common Man'' closing the concert at the stroke of midnight. 11 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248; free. (Kozinn)    YING QUARTET (Thursday) This quartet continues its series of enterprising programs at Symphony Space with an evening built around the music of Tod Machover. The centerpiece of the concert is the New York premiere of Mr. Machover's ''  but not simpler ,'' and interludes by Mr. Machover will connect the other works on the program, which includes music by Elliott Carter, John Cage, Bach, Byrd and the Beatles. 7:30 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $21; $18 for students and 65+.

(Jennifer Dunning)    'IT'S A DANCE THING' (Thursday) Choreographed by Prisca Ouya and Kiazi Malonga, this dance play is based on a Congolese legend about the mermaid Mami Wata and her love for the mortal King Mfumi of the Bakongo Kingdom. (Through Jan. 8.) 7:30 p.m., LaMaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; $20. (Dunning)    SARAH EAST JOHNSON (Thursday through Feb. 19) Ms. Johnson's award-winning, all-women company, LAVA, presents ''(w)HOLE'' (short for ''The Whole History of Life on Earth''), its first new work since 2003. Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve. Thursday through Saturday at 7 p.m., and Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25. (Erika Kinetz)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Today and Tuesday through Thursday) The last two performances of Balanchine's ''Nutcracker'' are today, with the opening of the regular winter repertory season, which runs until Feb. 26, following on Tuesday. Today at 2 and 8 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, www.nycballet.com: ''Nutcracker,'' $20 to $99; regular season, $30 to $86. (Rockwell)    'THIS WAY THAT WAY' (Today and tomorrow) The show, developed by Mark Lonergan of Parallel Exit, follows two con men on a cross-country adventure in a production that blends vaudeville, physical theater and dance, with the stars Joel Jeske and Ryan Kasprzak. Today at 2:15 and 7:15 p.m., tomorrow at 4:15 and 8:15 p.m., 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, www.59E59.org; $35; $15 for children.

Museums    Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age and the global consumerist economy. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    CHELSEA ART MUSEUM: 'THE BODY IMAGE IN CRISTÓBAL GABARRÓN'S ART, 1963-2005,' through Jan. 14. A member of the mid-20th-century European Informal art movement based on mentally improvised rather than formal motifs, this Spanish artist is concerned with the body but not in its traditional manifestations. His abstractions and semiabstractions give it a morphing, metaphysical presence; sometimes they involve the depiction of actual body parts, but they rely more on textures, colors and vague forms to evoke the body's ever-shifting sense of itself. But for all the blustery vigor on display, the work gives the viewer a powerful sense of been-there-seen-that. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719. (Grace Glueck)    * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Roberta Smith)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Smith)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRaPHY: 'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Johnson)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer who incorporates into his work artifacts he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Glueck)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)    * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    * Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter)    * Museum of Modern Art: 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,'  through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. (See above.) (Smith)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what Latino art means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter)    * The Museum for African Art: 'Lasting Foundations: The Art oF Architecture in Africa,' through Jan. 6. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)    neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)    * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    Charles Biederman: 'Works from the 30's' One of the most interestingly maverick and talented of between-the-wars American Modernists, Biederman left New York in 1942 for Minnesota, where he continued to make art and write art theory until his death in 2004. This small exhibition of biomorphic abstract paintings and one glossy construction of squares and knobs from the 1930's shows what an excellent student of European Surrealism and Constructivism he was. Meredith Ward, 60 East 66th Street, (212) 744-7306, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Richard Pousette-Dart: 'Presences: The Imploding of Color' Though routinely associated with Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart had metaphysical and symbolist interests that distinguished him from better-known members of that group. In the 1960's and 70's, he turned to what you could call Pointillist Color Field Painting, and though the sensuous impact of light, color and thickly stippled paint is strongly asserted, the works are also animated by intimations of cosmic mysticism. Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    'Structure' Hardly any artist today takes geometry as seriously as certain American Modernists did, following the lead of Mondrian in the mid-20th century. So this well-produced show of geometric relief sculptures by Ilya Bolotowsky, Nikolai Kasak and Charles Biederman, among others, comes as a nice surprise. Eli Bornstein's truly beautiful, neatly gridded constructions of floating wood blocks painted lovely confectionery colors are alone worth the trip. Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Abetz/Drescher The Berlin-based collaborators Maike Abetz and Oliver Drescher paint large, busily detailed pictures of Renaissance ruins densely populated by fashion models, broken guitars, televisions and naked figures from pagan myth in a style you might call psychedelic Pre-Raphaelite. Though not impressive formally or technically, they do capture a certain wildly eclectic and deeply narcissistic state of youthful consciousness. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Marina Abramovic: 'Balkan Erotic Epic' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    Carolina Raquel Antich: 'All of a Sudden' An Argentine who lives in Venice, where she was included in last summer's biennale, Ms. Antich makes extremely spare paintings and drawings of children that exude moods of such sweet innocence that you can't help suspecting something malevolent lurking just beyond the outer edges of her imagery. Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Miki Carmi: 'Psychic Readymades' This young Israeli-born painter makes strangely creepy pictures of oversize bald heads based on those of elderly members of his family. He lavishes painterly attention on veins, age spots, baggy eyes, wrinkles and drooping lips, and he floats the heads like weird balloons against white backgrounds. The paintings are far from beautiful, but their unsettling impact feels right for the often confusing roles that elders play in our psychic lives. Stux, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    RYAN DOOLAN: 'RATIONAL GAYZ'  This appealingly arcane debut by a Scottish artist includes small, vaguely photo-based paintings and a photo-performance work involving golf that look great in this austere but cozy new gallery. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 29th Street, (212) 481-0362, through Jan. 11. (Smith)    Matthew McCaslin This inventive sculptor plays with the tension between nature and technology. A working fountain has water flowing from sunflowers made of wide showerheads and copper pipe planted in a claw-foot bathtub. And the arrangement of a cuckoo clock and a flat-screen video view of peaceful lake waters on a natural plywood wall slyly enhances the faux-rustic ambience. Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    GORDON MOORE Elegantly understated paintings animated by ghostly linear figures and their shadows, which gambol before the large-paned grid of -- well, maybe a factory window. Composed of lines of different lengths and colors and various thicknesses, these antic figures seem to vibrate on and under the paintings' lightly brushed surfaces. Mr. Moore rings many intricate variations on his basic format, which, while it commits to the visible, manages to engage the mystery of what lies beyond it. Betty Cuningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through Jan. 28. (Glueck)    Annysa Ng: 'Love & Fear' A beautiful new gallery occupying two floors of a tiny brick house presents works of postmodernist faux-antiquity by a Chinese artist who has studied in Hong Kong, New York and Germany. The large, Victorian-style silhouettes are not without possibilities, though perhaps they are too Kara Walker-like; the hanging assemblages made of braided hair, fabric and found objects have an erotically stirring poetic delicacy. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, (212) 367-9093, through Jan. 20. (Johnson)    Nicholas Nixon: 'Life and Times' Among other photographs from the last 30 years, this show features Mr. Nixon's famous ''Brown Sisters,'' a set of group portraits of four sisters made annually, starting in 1975. It is almost painfully touching to see the beautiful siblings evolve from teenagers to late middle age. And then you begin to wonder how long this can go on before one of the five participants will no longer be available. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith)    PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)    Felix Schramm: 'Comber' It looks as if a tornado ripped parts off an ordinary house and slammed them into the gallery, creating a Cubist-Expressionist-style environment that was, in fact, carefully designed and assembled by this young and innovative German sculptor. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-2388, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Catherine Sullivan: 'The Chittendens' In a multiprojection video work, professional actors, none speaking, perform scripted sequences of actions. At first the effect is comical, but humor is overridden by an academic mission to deconstruct codes of behavior in film, theater and real life. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo and TriBeCa    * JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy, 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending on a ladder into a kind of rabbit hole. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    'The Last Generation' More or less obscurely, this group show addresses how digital forms of communication and representation are altering human experience. Best are Kota Ezawa's black-and-white animation of a scene from ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''; Jan Mancuska's text and video sculpture; motorized military hats doing synchronized movements, by Malachi Farrell; and Laurent Montaron's combination of a digital photograph of someone sleeping and an audio system that plays on headphones the sounds a sleeper makes. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Last Chance    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS' Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    * MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT' Hands down the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. (See above.) Closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)    * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS' Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. (See above.) Closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)    NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: BRIAN JUNGEN Aware that the Nike Air Jordan sneakers worn by the basketball star Michael Jordan are a fetish item for youth throughout the world, Mr. Jungen, a young British Columbian partly of Northwest Coast Indian descent, has cleverly refashioned these trophy sneakers into ceremonial masks that strikingly suggest those produced by Northwest Coast tribes.. A sardonic and wizardly craftsman is at work here. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 219-1222, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)    Derek Walcott: 'Another Life' In his spare time, the 1992 Nobel laureate in literature makes amateurish but appealing Impressionist-style oil and watercolor paintings of Caribbean towns and beaches. June Kelly, 591 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 226-1660, closing today. (Johnson)    Richard Walker: 'Beacon Road Paintings' Working on compact panels in a deft, painterly style that mixes influences of Alex Katz and Neil Welliver, this Scottish artist creates vividly atmospheric views of snowy woods and other quiet nature scenes. Alexander, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828, closing today.

Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'CANDIDA' Opens Wednesday. George Bernard Shaw's play about ''that very immoral'' -- his words -- title character who must choose between her husband and the poet who has fallen in love with her (1:55). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200.    'ALMOST, MAINE' Opens Jan. 12. A comedy featuring 11 episodes, which all take place at 9 p.m. on a Friday, about love and heartbreak in a cold town in Maine (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200.    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' Opens Jan. 10. The New York premiere of a new play by Nilo Cruz (''Anna in the Tropics'') about a young woman who travels to Spain to reconcile with her father (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212.    'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Opens Jan. 10. If you're pining for the television series ''Entourage,'' currently on hiatus, you might want to try Douglas Carter Beane's new comedy, which covers similar territory: Hollywood agent, cute movie star, tabloid gossip (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    Broadway    'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there's no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'APPARITION' Anne Washburn's gothic shorts are like an excellent late-night storytelling session at the Vincent Price camp for disturbed children (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Jason Zinoman)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Zinoman)    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' Spirited entertainment (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is pleasantly fluffy, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way, but lots of laughs (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)    'HIS ROYAL HIPNESS LORD BUCKLEY IN THE ZAM ZAM ROOM' Jake Broder's scrupulous (and rigid) re-creation of the influential nightclub comic Lord Buckley, an unlikely mix of English royalty and Dizzy Gillespie (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman).    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    *'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' The joyous surprise of this Shakespeare's Globe production, directed by John Dove, is how it floods this famously dark play with continuously roaming beams of comic light. In particular Mark Rylance, the troupe's outgoing artistic director, is an endearingly clueless Duke Vincentio (3:05). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Isherwood)    'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION'  An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    'THE OTHER SIDE'  In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'PETER PAN'  (2:00). Entertaining without being exhilarating (2:00). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, 4 Penn Plaza, (212) 307-7171. (Van Gelder)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'TIGHT EMBRACE'  Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas's political hostage drama wants to show, with its dash of magic realism and flickering poetic fire, how human beings use language as a weapon to betray one another. Good acting, especially by Zabryna Guevara, helps the play toward its goal (2:00). Intar Theater at the Kirk on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'FEAR ITSELF: SECRETS OF THE WHITE HOUSE' In the latest cartoonish send-up of the Bush administration, the simple task of translating ideas into dramatic form seems to have been overlooked (1:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255. (Zinoman)    * 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway.

(Brantley)    Last Chance    'HAYMARKET' Zayd Dohrn, son of Weather Underground members Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers, mixes documentary, fiction and memory in this play about the bomb that exploded at an 1886 worker's rally in Chicago and the anarchists who were hanged for the crime (2:05). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing today. (Miriam Horn)    * 'KLONSKY & SCHWARTZ' Romulus Linney's amusing if thin drama follows the unbalanced friendship between the poet Delmore Schwartz and his protégé (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, closing today. (Zinoman)    'ROPE' The key revelation of this revival of the Patrick Hamilton play that became a Hitchcock movie: The whole darn thing was originally set in a fancy London parlor stuffed with fancy British people. David Warren's staging of this theatrical relic boasts a juicy cast, but the play just lies there, like the corpse in the chest at center stage (2:05). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing today. (Isherwood)    'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    'THREE DOLLAR BILL' Three exhaustingly clever one-acts by Kirk Wood Bromley about being gay, conservative and miserable (2:00).

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AEON FLUX' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Adapted from MTV animated shorts from a decade ago, this glossy, incoherent movie sends Charlize Theron 400 years into the future, where she runs around and does somersaults in a spandex body suit. (A. O. Scott)    'BE HERE TO LOVE ME' (No rating, 99 minutes) Margaret Brown's documentary biography of the brilliant, deeply troubled Texan singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt is a tender, impressionistic labor of love. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Holden)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)    'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE'  (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)    'ELECTRIC SHADOWS' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Mandarin) The fanciful Chinese tear-jerker, which spans several decades from the Cultural Revolution to the present, wants to be an Asian ''Cinema Paradiso,'' but doesn't quite live up to its prototype. (Holden)    'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warmhearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    *'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'IN THE MIX' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This predictable, one-dimensional romantic comedy is all about its star, Usher, who plays a New York D.J. beloved by one and all. Beautiful women lust after him, but when a Mafia princess (Emmanuelle Chriqui) joins their number, her mobster father (Chazz Palminteri) disapproves. Even though Darrell (Usher) once took a bullet for him. (Anita Gates)    'ISN'T THIS A TIME!: A TRIBUTE TO HAROLD LEVENTHAL' (No rating, 90 minutes) Jim Brown's touching documentary cuts between onstage musical numbers and behind-the-scenes recollections from the Weavers; Arlo Guthrie; Peter, Paul and Mary; and other folk musicians who organized and performed a Thanksgiving 2003 tribute concert to this distinguished manager and promoter, who helped establish their careers. (Laura Kern)    * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old, seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)    'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)    'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)    'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    ARTIST'S CHOICE: STEPHEN SONDHEIM (Through Jan. 8) The Museum of Modern Art's 15-film series of works selected by Mr. Sondheim, the Broadway composer and lyricist, continues.

This week's features include ''Grey Gardens'' (1975), the sad profile of two of Jacqueline Onassis's Bouvier relatives in reduced circumstances; ''Gimme Shelter'' (1970), about the Rolling Stones and Hell's Angels at the tragic Altamont concert; ''What's Happening! The Beatles in the U.S.A.'' (1964), filmed during one of the Fab Four's first visits here; and ''Umbrellas'' (1995), one of five Maysles films about the installations of the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

Opera    'AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Tobias Picker's much-anticipated opera, based on Theodore Dreiser's landmark 1925 novel, a rare Metropolitan Opera commission, breaks no new ground for musical originality and dramatic inventiveness. This is an unabashedly conventional melodrama. Whole stretches of Mr. Picker's Neo-Romantic score would not be out of place on Broadway. Still, with an effective libretto by Gene Scheer that reduces the 900-page novel to its essential narrative strands, ''An American Tragedy'' has its own kind of sweep and passion. And every time Mr. Picker summons his modernist vein, the music becomes more challenging and consequently more involving. The production by Francesca Zambello, with its three-tiered set, is impressive to see and flows deftly. And the cast could not be better, with the dashing baritone Nathan Gunn as Clyde Griffiths, the ambitious social-climber, the soprano Patricia Racette as the wistful factory worker Roberta, and the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the moneyed and dazzling Sondra. James Conlon conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220.(Anthony Tommasini)    'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Monday, Thursday and Dec. 31) Most stagings of Strauss's ever-popular operetta, including some revivals of the Met's 1986 Otto Schenk production, seem uncomfortable with the mix of silliness and cynicism in the story of playful infidelities in 1870's Vienna. But the Met's current presentation boasts a winning cast of singers who, for the most part, take the story seriously and give subtle portrayals, especially Bo Skovhus as the ladies man Gabriel von Eisenstein, Sondra Radvanovsky as his knowing wife, Marlis Petersen as the perky chambermaid Adele and Earle Patriarco as the wily Dr. Falke. Jacques Lacombe conducts a lithe and fresh performance. And with the masterful comedic actor Bill Irwin as the drunken jailor Frosch, the show has plenty of hilarity. Those attending the New Year's Eve performance can count on surprise guests showing up to sing during the party scene in Act Two. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Dec. 31 at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $250. (Tommasini)    'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Tonight) On opening night of the Met's revival of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' in late October the admirable American soprano Elizabeth Futral gave a vocally top-notch and sensitive performance of the touchstone title role. Still, determined to sing this daunting role with musicianly honesty, she seemed reticent to plumb the emotional recesses of this unstable and fascinating character. So it should be interesting to hear her Lucia now that she has gotten the jitters out and lived with the role in Nicolas Joël's production. The veteran Bel Canto tenor Ramón Vargas sings Edgardo. Edoardo Müller conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $205. (Tommasini)    'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tonight and tomorrow) The tiny Amato Opera can pick up on a holiday tradition with the best of them. For the 100th anniversary of Franz Lehar's classic operetta, it's offering the piece in a new English translation. 7:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30, $25 for students and 65+.(Anne Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tomorrow) Seasonal music is in the eye, or ear, of the beholder. And to hear Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations in their entirety performed by a skilled pianist, Steven Beck, seems a wonderful holiday present. 7:30 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $60. (Midgette)    'A BOHEMIAN CHRISTMAS' (Sunday) The Bohemians of the title are not funky artists, but residents of medieval Prague. The ensemble Early Music New York is offering a program of 13th- to 15th-century music from Bohemia and, incongruously, Poland; it isn't all Christmas music by any means, but it's a nicely organized program. 3 and 8 p.m., St. James Chapel, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 110th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330; $40. (Midgette)    HANDEL'S 'MESSIAH' (Tonight) Andrew Megill leads the veteran Masterwork Chorus and Orchestra in the second of its two annual ''Messiah'' performances in Carnegie Hall. Julianne Baird, Margaret Lattimore, Philippe Castagner and Brian Mulligan are the soloists. This is typically a solid competitor in a crowded ''Messiah'' field. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $100.(Jeremy Eichler)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Lorin Maazel leads the orchestra in Sibelius's Fifth Symphony along with Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with Julia Fischer as soloist and Weber's Bassoon Concerto with Judith LeClair. 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92. (Eichler)    NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Every year around this time, the New York String Orchestra Seminar assembles talented young players from the nation's high schools and conservatories for 10 days of intensive rehearsals and coaching capped by two performances. First up is an all-Mozart program including the Overture to ''The Marriage of Figaro'' and the Piano Concerto No. 21 with Jonathan Biss as soloist. Next, on Wednesday, comes a more eclectic program ranging from Bach to Barber with Beethoven and Spohr in between. Hilary Hahn joins as soloist and Jaime Laredo conducts both nights. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $17 to $47. (Eichler)    P. D. Q. BACH (Tuesday through Thursday) Believe it or not, it's been 40 years since the composer and satirist Peter Schickele first ''discovered'' the music of his own creation, P. D. Q. Bach, whom he describes as ''the last and certainly the least of Johann Sebastian Bach's interminable children.'' Mr. Schickele marks the anniversary this week with three performances of his ''40-Year Retrogressive'' program, in which he'll reprise various P. D. Q. favorites while no doubt gleefully skewering the conventions of musicology and concert life along the way. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26 to $56. (Eichler)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday though Thursday) More shifting repertory from this vibrant company, performing mixed bills. ''Ailey Classics'' tonight and Wednesday night, and a program of seasonal novelties tomorrow afternoon. (The season runs to Jan. 1.) Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 7 p.m., New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.alvinailey.org or www.nycitycenter.org; $25 to $75.(John Rockwell)    SAVION GLOVER (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday) This Tony Award-winning tap stylist (''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'') is back again, doing what he does best. (Through Jan. 15. ) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 2 and 8 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $34 to $42. (Jennifer Dunning)    * 'THE NUTCRACKER' (Through Thursday) The last week of the New York City Ballet in George Balanchine's perennial holiday favorite, with ever-shifting casts. This afternoon, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and next Friday at 2 p.m., tonight and next Friday (the last performance of the run) at 8 p.m., and Monday through Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, www.nycballet.com; $20 to $99. (Rockwell)    'THE NUTCRACKER' (Today, Monday and Tuesday) For those who prefer Long Island to Lincoln Center, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet soloist Bonnie Pickard performs the role of the Sugarplum Fairy in the Eglevsky Ballet's ''Nutcracker.'' Today at 5 p.m., Monday and Tuesday at noon and 5 p.m.. Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, Brooksville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100; $25 to 45. (Claudia La Rocco)    'THIS WAY THAT WAY' (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) The show, developed by Mark Lonergan of Parallel Exit, follows two con men on a cross-country adventure in a production that blends vaudeville, physical theater and dance, with the stars Joel Jeske and Ryan Kasprzak. (Through Dec. 31.) Tonight at 7:15, tomorrow and Sunday at 2:15 p.m., Tuesday at 7:15 p.m., Wednesday at 2:15 and 7:15 p.m., 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, www.59E59.org; $35; $15 for children. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Over all, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age and the global consumerist economy. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Kyoto, Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Roberta Smith)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Smith)    'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in a exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Johnson)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. through Feb. 19th (Grace Glueck)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? These are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle class and of European descent. Using photography and video, the artists have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in rural Postville, Iowa. (See above.) (Glueck)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * Museum of Modern Art: 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,'  through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculpted models by 80 artists, numerous projections and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that goes into them is nonetheless something of a wonder too. (See above.) (Smith)    * The Museum for African Art: 'Lasting Foundations: The Art oF Architecture in Africa,' through Jan. 6. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)    neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    * New York Public Library: 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS,' through Feb. 12. Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069. (Smith)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)    The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through March 12. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Johnson)    * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    Charles Biederman: 'Works from the Thirties' One of the most interestingly maverick and talented of between-the-wars American Modernists, Biederman left New York in 1942 for Minnesota, where he continued to make art and write art theory until his death in 2004. This small exhibition of biomorphic abstract paintings and one glossy construction of squares and knobs from the 1930's shows what an excellent student he was of European Surrealism and Constructivism. Meredith Ward, 60 East 66th Street, (212) 744-7306, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Richard Pousette-Dart: 'Presences: The Imploding of Color' Though routinely associated with Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart had metaphysical and symbolist interests that distinguished him from better-known members of that group. In the 1960's and 70's, he turned to what you could call Pointillist Color Field Painting, and though the sensuous impact of light, color and thickly stippled paint is strongly asserted, the works are also animated by intimations of cosmic mysticism. Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    'Structure' Hardly any artist today takes geometry as seriously as certain American Modernists did following the lead of Mondrian in the mid-20th century. So this well-produced show of geometric relief sculptures by Ilya Bolotowsky, Nikolai Kasak and Charles Biederman among others comes as a nice surprise. Eli Bornstein's truly beautiful, neatly gridded constructions of floating wood blocks painted lovely confectionery colors are alone worth the trip. Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 355-4545, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Richard Walker: 'Beacon Road Paintings' Working on compact panels in a deft, painterly style that mixes influences of Alex Katz and Neil Welliver, this Scottish artist creates vividly atmospheric views of snowy woods and other quiet nature scenes. Alexander, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828, through Dec. 30. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Abetz/Drescher The Berlin-based collaborators Maike Abetz and Oliver Drescher paint large, busily detailed pictures of Renaissance ruins densely populated by fashion models, broken guitars, televisions and naked figures from pagan myth in a style you might call psychedelic Pre-Raphaelite. Though not impressive formally or technically, they do capture a certain wildly eclectic and deeply narcissistic state of youthful consciousness. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Carolina Raquel Antich: 'All of a Sudden' An Argentine who lives in Venice, where she was included in last summer's biennale, Ms. Antich makes extremely spare paintings and drawings of children that exude moods of such sweet innocence that you can't help suspecting something malevolent lurking just beyond the outer edges of her imagery. Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Miki Carmi: 'Psychic Readymades' This young Israel-born painter makes strangely creepy pictures of senior citizens' oversize bald heads based on members of his family. He lavishes painterly attention on veins, age spots, baggy eyes, wrinkles and drooping lips, and he floats the heads like weird balloons against white backgrounds. The paintings are far from beautiful, but their unsettling impact feels right for the often confusing roles that elders play in our psychic lives. Stux, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort-of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith).    Paula Scher: 'The Maps' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)    Catherine Sullivan: 'The Chittendens' In a multiprojection video work, professional actors, none speaking, perform scripted sequences of actions. At first the effect is comical, but humor is overridden by an academic mission to deconstruct codes of behavior in film, theater and real life. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, through today. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    * JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending into a kind of rabbit hole on a ladder. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    Last Chance    CHARLES BURCHFIELD: 'PAINTINGS, 1915-1964,' The best landscapes of this underappreciated American modernist, seen here in a rare, well-selected survey of his watercolors, depict a natural world that is lighted from within. D. C. Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 247-2111, closing today. (Smith)    Dave Cooper: 'pictorial ruminations on the volume and density of mostly pillowy girls' Comically weird illustration is enjoying great popularity among artists under 40. The Ottawa-based Mr. Cooper is a master of the genre. His manically surrealistic paintings and drawings of toothy, pop-eyed women in hectic situations mix attraction and repulsion with infectious verve. Jonathan Levine, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-3822, closing today. (Johnson)    GEORGE GROSZ: 'HIS VISUAL AND THEATRICAL POLITICS' This small banquet of George Grosz's drawings from 1914 to 1930 -- before he came to the United States -- shows his work in two arenas, for publication and for the stage, at the height of his wit and moral indignation. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500, closing today. (Glueck)    Hans Haacke: 'State of the Union' People say that the days of politically minded art are over. The market, that monstrous sponge, absorbs and neutralizes all. But there may be at least one resistant margin left: uncoolness. Uncool art can do and say whatever it wants, because the market doesn't care. Hans Haacke's art has been doing and saying what it wants for 40 years. Sometimes his socially engaged Conceptualism is in synch with fashion; at other times, like now, it is not. But he keeps to his course, changing the forms, adjusting the themes, renewing the commitment. In this show he carries the case for art as political argument into the post-9/11 present. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, closing today.(Cotter)    Gwen Hardie: 'Face Paintings' Each of Ms. Hardie's quietly arresting, medium-size canvases depicts a much enlarged part of someone's face -- an eye, a nose, the top of a lip -- realized in thin layers of smudgy color. Detail is suppressed, and the paintings veer toward an evocatively blurry and enigmatic generalization that verges in some cases on abstraction. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 947-2818, closing today. (Johnson)    BYRON KIM: 'ODDLY FLOWING' In this rambling show by an artist who made a splash in the early 1990's by comparing the skin tones of different people in monochromatic canvases, most interesting are the photographic assemblages under the rubric of ''What I See.'' These impressions of important places in his life, like the one of his backyard in Park Slope, Brooklyn, have a sweet, nostalgic poignancy. Each is the result of a 360-degree sweep with a digital camera, with the images reassembled into an intensified whole. They tweak the landscape in a lively fashion. But the show needs focus; the inclusion of other, unrelated works weakens its impact. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6999, closing today. (Glueck)    * Helen Levitt: 'Slide Show: Color Photographs 1959-1984' For some artists, Ms. Levitt is one, the camera is less an expertly operated tool than a seamless extension of mind, eye and heart. Made from slides, the 21 color pictures in this show of things happening in the street are small miracles of form, story-telling and metaphor. Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930, closing today.(Johnson)    * Mary Ellen Mark: 'Falkland Road' When the American photographer Mary Ellen Mark started visiting India in the 1960's, she didn't head for the Taj Mahal. She hung out on a jammed and noisy street in Bombay called Falkland Road, the city's busiest low-rent red light district. Her goal was to photograph the prostitutes -- men and women, children and adults -- who lived and worked there. The complete series of pictures, exhibited only once before in the United States in 1981, is on view in two Chelsea galleries. The images are as startling and engrossing as ever. And with the devastating spread of AIDS in India since they were made, they are something more. Marianne Boesky Gallery and Yancy Richardson Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea. Boesky: (212) 680-9889; Richardson: (646) 230-9610, closing today. (Cotter)    TIM NOBLE & SUE WEBSTER: 'THE GLORY HOLE' The latest gimmickry from this British art team consists of metal scrap assemblages that conjure up 1950's junk sculptures and, properly lighted, cast shadows of the artists' faces or bodies in profile. Briefly diverting side-show humanism. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, closing today. (Smith)    * Claes Oldenburg This excellent show of works from the 60's by this seminal Pop artist includes paint-splattered objects like oversize sneakers and a slice of pie à la mode and soft, stuffed objects like a toilet and a giant house key. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, closing today. (Johnson)    Lari Pittman New, weirdly antic pictures of domestic interiors rendered in a luminous, splintery Cubist style by this Los Angeles-based painter are visually captivating and poetically mysterious. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300, closing today. (Johnson)    'Traffic' As usual for its big group exhibitions, Exit Art's current Biennial, this one devoted to the theme of traffic -- vehicular and otherwise -- is messy, youthful, noisy, crowded and entertaining. Highlights include a miniature model of a sidewalk construction site walkway by Chantel Foretich; portraits of 10 New York art dealers -- i.e., art traffic controllers -- by Tom Hébert; a finely made plywood tower mimicking a mold for pouring concrete highway bridge supports, by Mike Wsol; a set of ceramic train cars by David Packer; and many variously amusing, tedious and distracting videos. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, closing today. (Johnson)    CY TWOMBLY: 'BACCHUS' Eight paintings deliver a red-hot visual tsunami via the artist's characteristic spiraling scribbles writ large across amazing, angry, joyful enveloping surfaces that are in the grand tradition of the aging painter letting it rip. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, closing today. (Smith)    REBECCA WARREN: 'PAS DE DEUX' A young British sculptor who works in unfired, sometimes painted clay, makes an impressive debut with sculptures that roam the history of sculpture and decorative objects with juicy abandon, sprouting snoutlike breasts and frazzled roses and culminating in large figures of dancers that split the difference between Degas and de Kooning, with a little Francis Bacon thrown in for good measure. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, closing today at 3 p.m. (Smith).",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/23/arts/movies/the-listings-dec-23-dec-29.html,"Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.

A comedy featuring 11 episodes, which all take place at 9 p.m. on a Friday, about love and heartbreak in a cold town in Maine (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200.    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' Opens Jan. 10. The New York premiere of a new play by Nilo Cruz (''Anna in the Tropics'') about a young woman who travels to Spain to reconcile with her father (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212.    'CANDIDA' Previews start today. Opens Dec. 28. George Bernard Shaw's play about ''that very immoral'' -- his words -- title character who must choose between her husband and the poet who has fallen in love with her (1:55). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200.    'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Opens Jan. 10. If you're pining for the television series ''Entourage,'' currently on hiatus, you might want to try Douglas Carter Beane's new comedy, which covers similar territory: Hollywood agent, cute movie star, tabloid gossip (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' Opens Dec. 18. Dana Ivey stars in what might be the best play about hookers ever written, courtesy of George Bernard Shaw, who deftly exposes double standards in Victorian society (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737.    Broadway    'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there's no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. ( Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Neil Genzlinger)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'APPARITION' Anne Washburn's gothic shorts are like an excellent late-night storytelling session at the Vincent Price camp for disturbed children (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Jason Zinoman)    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is pleasantly fluffy, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way, but lots of laughs (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)    'HAYMARKET' Zayd Dohrn, son of Weather Underground members Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers, mixes documentary, fiction and memory in this play about the bomb that exploded at an 1886 worker's rally in Chicago and the anarchists who were hanged for the crime (2:05). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Miriam Horn)    'HIS ROYAL HIPNESS LORD BUCKLEY IN THE ZAM ZAM ROOM' Jake Broder's scrupulous (and rigid) re-creation of the influential nightclub comic Lord Buckley, an unlikely mix of English royalty and Dizzy Gillespie (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. ( Zinoman).    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'KLONSKY & SCHWARTZ' Romulus Linney's amusing if thin drama follows the unbalanced friendship between the poet Delmore Schwartz and his protégé (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman)    'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'THE OTHER SIDE'  In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'PETER PAN'  (2:00). Entertaining without being exhilarating (2:00). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, 4 Penn Plaza, (212) 307-7171. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'ROPE' The key revelation of this revival of the Patrick Hamilton play that became a Hitchcock movie: The whole darn thing was originally set in a fancy London parlor stuffed with fancy British people. David Warren's staging of this theatrical relic boasts a juicy cast, but the play just lies there, like the corpse in the chest at center stage (2:05). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TIGHT EMBRACE'  Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas's political hostage drama wants to show, with its dash of magic realism and flickering poetic fire, how human beings use language as a weapon to betray one another. Good acting, especially by Zabryna Guevara, helps the play toward its goal (2:00). Intar Theater at the Kirk on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (2:15). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'FEAR ITSELF: SECRETS OF THE WHITE HOUSE' In the latest cartoonish send-up of the Bush administration, the simple task of translating ideas into dramatic form seems to have been overlooked (1:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255. ( Zinoman).    'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-0255. (Genzlinger)    'THREE DOLLAR BILL' Three exhaustingly clever one-acts by Kirk Wood Bromley about being gay, conservative and miserable (2:00). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Flatiron district, fourth floor; (212) 501-4528. (Zinoman).    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30).

(Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BACH AT LEIPZIG' Itamar Moses's comedy is an ardent but hollow literary homage to Tom Stoppard stuffed with arcana about religious and musical squabbles in 18th-century Germany and knowingly feeble jokes. Despite the nimble gifts of a first-rate cast, the play never works up the farcical energy to lift us over the puddles of book-learning (2:15). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    * CORONADO Dennis Lehane, the novelist known for ''Mystic River,'' tries his hand at playwriting and, remarkably, finds something fresh in the shady-characters-in-a-bar genre. The trick: throwing the clock out the window. The actors of the Invisible City Theater Company play it full throttle, to great effect (2:00). Invisible City Theater, at Manhattan Theater Source, 177 MacDougal Street, between Eighth Street and Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 981-8240, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AEON FLUX' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Adapted from MTV animated shorts from a decade ago, this glossy, incoherent movie sends Charlize Theron 400 years into the future, where she runs around and does somersaults in a spandex body suit. (A. O. Scott)    'BE HERE TO LOVE ME' (No rating, 99 minutes) Margaret Brown's documentary biography of the brilliant, deeply troubled Texan singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt is a tender, impressionistic labor of love. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Holden)    * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two cowboys who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)    'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE'  (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted, and sometimes awed. (Scott)    * 'DOWN TO THE BONE' (No rating, 105 minutes) ''Down to the Bone,'' which won the special jury prize at last year's Sundance Festival, is the kind of movie most independent films strive in vain to be: a small, beautifully faceted gem. Vera Farmiga gives a pitch-perfect performance as Irene, a mother of two whose life is precariously built around a cocaine addiction. (Dana Stevens)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'IN THE MIX' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This predictable, one-dimensional romantic comedy is all about its star, Usher, who plays a New York D.J. beloved by one and all. Beautiful women lust after him, but when a Mafia princess (Emmanuelle Chriqui) joins their number, her mobster father (Chazz Palminteri) disapproves. Even though Darrell (Usher) once took a bullet for him. (Anita Gates)    'ISN'T THIS A TIME!: A TRIBUTE TO HAROLD LEVENTHAL' (No rating, 90 minutes) Jim Brown's touching documentary cuts between onstage musical numbers and behind-the-scenes recollections from the Weavers; Arlo Guthrie; Peter, Paul and Mary; and other folk musicians who organized and performed a Thanksgiving 2003 tribute concert to this distinguished manager and promoter, who helped establish their careers. (Laura Kern)    * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old, seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)    'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the 1991 Persian Gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of Los Angeles noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)    'KRISANA/THE FALLEN' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Latvian) Walking on a bridge late one night, a dour Latvian bureaucrat witnesses a stranger's suicide. Posing as the dead woman's boyfriend, he slowly loses himself in a tormented investigation of the woman's last days. Though its story is slight, ''Krisana'' is a moving meditation on guilt and responsibility. (Dana Stevens)    'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)    'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'TRAPPED BY MORMONS' (No rating, 69 minutes) A labored exercise in facile camp, this would-be cult curiosity remakes a notorious 1922 ''Mormonsploitation'' flick about a mesmeric vampire recruiter for the Latter Day Saints and his dim-witted victim. No, it isn't as fun as it sounds. (Nathan Lee)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    ARTISTS CHOICE: STEPHEN SONDHEIM (Through Jan. 8) The Museum of Modern Art's 15-film series of works selected by Mr. Sondheim, the legendary Broadway composer and lyricist, begins on Monday with ''Kontrakt'' (1980), a Polish comedy that Mr. Sondheim describes as having, ''for my money, the most devastating last shot in cinema,'' and Mike van Diem's ''Karakter'' (1997).

Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates)    PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION (Through Feb. 6) A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films is under way at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's features are ''A Bug's Life'' (1998), the story of an ant and an insect circus versus a gang of grasshoppers, and ''Toy Story'' (1995), about the rivalry between Woody the cowboy and Buzz Lightyear the robot. They will be accompanied by five Pixar shorts from the 1980's. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10; 65+ plus, $8; students, $6 (not including museum gallery admission).

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    NATASHA ALEXANDRA, LILY CUSHMAN CULHANE (Monday) The Canadian songstress Natasha Alexandra traffics in unschooled, confessional piano ballads. She plays here on a bill with the singer-songwriter Lily Cushman Culhane, whose tracks recall the trip-pop favored by wistful optimists like Dido and Jem. Her honeyed jazzy vocal technique sets her apart. 11 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8770; $10 cash, at the door only. (Laura Sinagra)    ALY & AJ (Tomorrow) Alyson and Amanda Joy Michalka are singing actress sisters of the pre-tabloid Olsens sort, positioning themselves as happy-go-lucky sylphs with an optimism summed up in their cover of Lovin' Spoonful's ''Do You Believe in Magic?'' They open here for the Cheetah Girls, a group formed around the TV movie of the same name. 3 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com, (212) 307-7171; $36 and $46. (Sinagra)    A.R.E. WEAPONS (Tuesday) During that strange early-millennium moment when ''electroclash'' was campaigning for genre status, this aggressive group emphasized the ''clash'' aspect. After the heroin death of its guitarist, the band imploded. Now it's back. 10 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; free. (Sinagra)    BON JOVI (Monday, Wednesday and Thursday) Jon Bon Jovi's band conquered the airwaves in the 1980's and 90's by sticking together everything catchy about 70's rock: Bruce Springsteen's earnestness, Led Zeppelin's crunch, Boston's harmonies and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $49.50-$97. (Sinagra)    THE BEAT GOES ON (Wednesday) This tour of rock history finds guest vocalists like James Chance, John S. Hall, Jon Paris and Andrew W. K. singing classics from the Brill Building to Big Star, backed by an ace back-up band. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE EARLIES (Tonight) Composing their music by mail from across the pond -- half the group lives in Texas, the other in England -- the Earlies come up with an atmospheric space rock that recalls the warm buzz of the Mercury Rev. Maybe it's the distance that gives them their message-in-a-bottle wistfulness. 11 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700;$10. (Sinagra)    MIHO HATORI (Tonight) Miho Hatori sang with the arty, funky lounge band Cibo Matto. She performs her own eclectic music here with Mauro Refosco and Gilmar Gomes on percussion, Shelley Burgon on harp, and the vocalist Thomas on pump organ and various keyboards. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra)    THE INTERNATIONAL NOISE CONSPIRACY (Tuesday) This Swedish band plays politically minded garage rock that's been getting less political lately. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13. (Sinagra)    LYFE JENNINGS (Sunday) This Toledo, Ohio, native and repeat Amateur Night at the Apollo winner, released his debut album, ''Lyfe 268-192'' (Columbia), last year. His ambitious, guitar-based songs inject crooning neo-soul with introspective narratives about hard knocks and tough choices. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $25.50 in advance, $29 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE LEMONHEADS (Tonight and tomorrow night) After spending the late 1990's in exile, the alt-pop heartthrob Evan Dando has cleaned up and taken tentative steps back into the limelight with solo projects and, now, a revisiting of his old hits and matter-of-fact melodicism. 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sinagra)    LIVING COLOUR (Tomorrow) The virtuoso guitarist and Black Rock Coalition co-founder Vernon Reid's most famous band's intelligent and at times groovy heavy metal took the group well beyond the small bar scene in the late 1980's. It returns to play snug CBGB's in the legendary dive's hour of need. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra)    LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Sunday) Led by the singers Allyssa Lamb and Emily Hurst, this band mixes musicians from the United States, France and Colombia who mine their Latin heritage in the performance of boleros, cha cha chas, cumbias, huaynos and cowboy songs. 9 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15.

Special guests include the country-rock icon Emmylou Harris, as well as Kate McGarrigle's children (and prickly cabaret talents themselves) Rufus and Martha Wainwright, along with another folk-rock scion, Richard and Linda Thompson's son Teddy Thompson. 8 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $69. (Sinagra)    THE MUSICAL BOX: LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Performing the entirety of Genesis's most bloated work of concert pageantry, 1974's ''Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,'' the Musical Box relives the days of grandiose and goofy art-rock, before Peter Gabriel left the band for a solo career, and Phil Collins took things in a poppier direction. 8, TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 220-1460; $50. (Sinagra)    ODETTA (Wednesday) Odetta has been a blues powerhouse since the 1950's, strumming hard and singing with a deep, leathery voice that harks back to field hollers and spirituals. She gives her songs the authority of archetypes. 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West and Vesey Streets, Lower Manhattan, worldfinancialcenter.com, (212) 945-2600; free.

(Sinagra)    SAVES THE DAY, SENSES FAIL (Sunday) More in the Death Cab for Cutie vein of contemplative emo rock than in the glut of full-on ''screamo'' bands that followed it onto the scene, Saves the Day plays here with Senses Fail, which is less distinguishable from other bands in the angst-driven power chord set. 5 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $19.50 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)    SEAN PAUL (Sunday) With his insinuating baritone, Sean Paul has become one of the most pop-minded exponents of Jamaican dancehall, preferring frisky party jams to the political screeds or raw sexual blasts of more hardcore peers. 7 p.m., Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500; $32.50 in advance, 35 at the door. (Sinagra)    DUNCAN SHEIK (Wednesday) The mild, jangly songwriter who had a 1996 hit with the pleasantly numbing ''Barely Breathing'' has a new album, but will play some Elliot Smith songs with the fellow songwriters on the bill, Chris Garneau and Jenny Owen Youngs, to raise money for a friend's bone marrow transplant. 10 p.m., The Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; $20. (Sinagra)    RONNIE SPECTOR'S X-MAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Still as sexy and brash as ever, the leader of the Ronettes brings the voice and frankness that powered hits like ''Be My Baby'' to Christmas fare like ''Frosty the Snowman'', ''Sleigh Ride'' and ''I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.'' 9, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144 ; $30 in advance, $34 at the door. (Sinagra)    STAIND, P.O.D. (Tonight) This bill features two of the most prominent purveyors of bad-childhood metal, which made the late 1990's such a rock drag. Staind made a career of being Limp Bizkit's alter egos -- big, tough guys strumming and sobbing on a candlelit stage. The born-again, reggae-tinged San Diego rockers P.O.D. scored with the more forceful cry of neglect, ''Youth of the Nation.'' 6:15 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $36. (Sinagra)    SUNN O))) (Sunday) The guitarists Stephen O'Malley and Greg Anderson play ambient droning metal that has added sonic wrinkles over the years, even collaborating with the noise sculptor Merzbow, in addition to luminaries of doom metal. Growing and Nachtmystium open. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    TRALALA, PALOMAR (Tomorrow) The local bubblegum rock experiment Tralala tops insistent guitar surge with lackadaisical girl-group vocals. It plays tomorrow with Palomar, a local indie-pop quartet with winsome songs that harken back to the 1990's heyday of female-fronted guitar bands. 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    TRANS-SIBERIAN ORCHESTRA (Monday) Christmas songs on mid-1980's rock steroids, for those who like their holiday spirit as bombastic as possible. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $33.50 to $65.50. (Pareles)    WHEATUS (Tonight) The Long Island melodist Brendan B. Brown is still writing pop-rock odes to adolescence and adulthood, despite suffering some major-label disappointments. His band's latest self-produced material is introspective but still energized. 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N. J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sinagra)    Z100 JINGLE BALL (Tonight) Nothing says ''Happy Holidays'' like a pop radio package extravaganza. This one will feature the best that the comeback-less Backstreet Boys, the energetic Fall Out Boy, the beat-friendly crooner Frankie J, the happy-go-lucky rapper Ludacris and the smooth chatterer Sean Paul have to offer. Tonight's stars will obviously be the outspoken and eloquent rapper-producer Kanye West and the brainy Columbian bombshell Shakira. 7:30, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $25 to $230. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

(Holden)    * Andrea Marcovicci (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) In her spellbinding retrospective ''I'll Be Seeing You  Love Songs of World War II,'' Ms. Marcovicci balances nostalgia for songs associated with ''the good war'' with acknowledgment of the real pain and sacrifice that inspired so many of them, providing a dusting of reality. 9 p.m., with late shows at 11:30 tonight and tomorrow night, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $65 cover, $60 Tuesday through Thursday, with a $50 prix fixe dinner at the early shows from Wednesday to Saturday, and a $20 minimum on Tuesday and at the late shows.

(Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY' (Tonight and Wednesday) Tobias Picker's much-anticipated opera, a rare Metropolitan Opera commission, breaks no new ground for musical originality and dramatic inventiveness. Whole stretches of Mr. Picker's neo-Romantic score would not be out of place on Broadway. Still, with an effective libretto by Gene Scheer based on Theodore Dreiser's landmark 1925 novel, ''An American Tragedy'' has its own kind of sweep and passion. The production by Francesca Zambello, with its three-tiered set, is impressive to see and flows deftly. And the cast could not be better, with the dashing baritone Nathan Gunn as Clyde Griffiths, the ambitious social climber; the soprano Patricia Racette as the wistful factory worker Roberta; and the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the moneyed and dazzling Sondra. Tonight at 8, Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205. (Anthony Tommasini)    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) All things must come to an end; and so the ''Carmen'' revival, having made its lumbering way through a host of principals, is finally winding to its close (for this season, at least). The last gasp is had by Denyce Graves, in one of her signature roles, partnered by the very loud but not very interesting Marco Berti as Don José. Ana Maria Martinez has just made her debut with the company as Micaëla, and been well regarded; Erwin Schrott is Escamillo; and Philippe Jordan remains the crisp and able conductor. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 and $220 tickets remaining. (Anne Midgette)    'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Tuesday) On opening night of the Met's revival of this Donizetti opera in late October, the admirable American soprano Elizabeth Futral gave a vocally top-notch and sensitive performance of the touchstone title role. Still, determined to sing this daunting role with musicianly honesty, she seemed hesitant to plumb the emotional recesses of this unstable and fascinating character. So it should be interesting to hear her Lucia now that she has gotten the jitters out and lived with the role. The veteran bel canto tenor Ramón Vargas sings Edgardo. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini)    'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tomorrow and Sunday). The tiny Amato Opera can pick up on a holiday tradition with the best of them. For the 100th anniversary of Lehar's classic operetta, it's offering the piece in a new English translation. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30, $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)    'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow) The soprano Anna Netrebko and the tenor Rolando Villazón, opera's hottest vocal couple of late, bring star appeal and impressive artistry to the Met's 1989 Otto Schenk production of Verdi's ''Rigoletto.'' With her dusky-toned and exciting voice, Ms. Netrebko gives an unusually emotional portrayal of Gilda. Mr. Villazón brings an ardent voice, Verdian style and virile energy to the Duke of Mantua. Yet these valuable young artists are still growing, and the hype about their work does not help them any. The baritone Carlo Guelfi is an honorable Rigoletto; Asher Fisch conducts a dynamic performance. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, though returns may be available at the box office. (Tommasini)    Classical Music    EMANUEL AX AND RICHARD STOLTZMAN (Tonight) The pianist Emanuel Ax's superb musicianship and Richard Stoltzman's energetic approach to the clarinet should yield lively performances of works by Debussy, Brahms, Gershwin, Bernstein and Lukas Foss. 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Allan Kozinn)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Great views and an unusual setting make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting places for chamber music. This weekend, the violinist Mark Peskanov and colleagues will charge through all six of Beethoven's Opus 18 sting quartets. Tonight will be Nos. 1 to 3; tomorrow and Sunday, Nos. 4 to 6.

(Jeremy Eichler)    'A BOHEMIAN CHRISTMAS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Bohemians of the title are not funky artists, but residents of medieval Prague. Early Music New York offers a program of 13th- to 15th-century music from Bohemia and, incongruously, Poland; it isn't all Christmas music by any means, but it's a nicely organized program. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330; $40. (Midgette)    'A CEREMONY OF CAROLS' (Sunday) Everyone has a favorite holiday piece: for me, it's Britten's ''Ceremony of Carols,'' a set of beautiful, not-quite-traditional choral works that are a part of Ignatius Loyola's Christmas concert (also featuring the Omega Liturgical Dance Company). 4 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212) 288-2520; $35 and $45; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)    LEON FLEISHER YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERTS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Under the auspices of Carnegie Hall's professional training workshops, the pianist, conductor and teacher Leon Fleisher worked with four younger pianists for a week earlier this fall, preparing performances of Mozart piano concertos.

(Eichler)    MASTERWORK CHORUS (Thursday) Andrew Megill leads this veteran group in the first of its two annual ''Messiah'' performances in Carnegie Hall. Julianne Baird, Margaret Lattimore, Philippe Castagner and Brian Mulligan are the soloists. This is typically a solid competitor in a crowded ''Messiah'' field. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $100. (Eichler)    MUSICA SACRA (Sunday and Tuesday) Richard Westenburg's account of Handel's ''Messiah'' has traditionally been robust and deeply felt, not to mention performed by one of New York's most finely polished choirs. The solo roster is estimable as well, with Lisa Saffer, soprano; Michael Chance, countertenor; Rufus Müller, tenor, and Kevin Deas, bass-baritone. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $120. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) This week the orchestra has split into two ensembles: one to play the regular subscription program, conducted by Christian Zacharias, at Avery Fisher Hall, the other to play Handel's ''Messiah'' at Riverside Church. Most of the week, the two programs compete directly -- as they do tomorrow evening -- but today a Philharmonic fan can have both. Mr. Zacharias conducts Haydn and Mozart in the morning, and Mr. Hickox leads Handel tonight, with the Westminster Symphonic Choir providing choral heft an attractive solo roster that includes Christine Brandes, soprano; Sara Mingardo, contralto; Mark Tucker, tenor; and John Relyea, bass-baritone. The Haydn and Mozart program is at 11 a.m. today and 8 p.m. tomorrow, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; $23 to $76; ''Messiah'' is at 8 tonight and tomorrow night, Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights; $29 to $72. (212) 721-6500. (Kozinn)    ORATORIO SOCIETY OF NEW YORK (Monday) This venerable choir, supported by the Westchester Philharmonic, presents its first ''Messiah'' under its new director, Kent Tritle, a conductor whose work at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola offers reason to suppose that good things are in the offing. The soloists are Sharla Nafziger, soprano; Mary Phillips, mezzo-soprano; Rufus Müller, tenor; and Philip Cutlip, baritone. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $17 to $75. (Kozinn)    PRISM CONCERTS (Sunday) This eclectic program, called ''Heroes, by George!,'' consists of highlights from various Handel oratorios, including ''Solomon,'' ''Esther'' and ''Samson.''

For the oratorios, Judith Clurman leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's, the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and various soloists. 7 p.m., Central Synagogue, Lexington Avenue, at 55th Street, (212) 581-0400; $25. (Eichler)    SPECULUM MUSICAE (Monday) If holiday shopping is numbing your senses, here is a concert that should give a bracing jolt to your psyche. The top-notch and highly respected contemporary music ensemble Speculum Musicae presents a formidable and typically adventurous program, with works by Jacob Druckman, Chou Wen-chung, Toru Takemitsu and Charles Wuorinen, and the New York premiere of David Rakowski's ''Inside Story,'' a piano trio composed this year. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-2227; $20; $10 for students.

Included as well are Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 1, and works by Leclair and Rameau. 7:30, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42 to $55. (Kozinn)    'UNSILENT NIGHT' (Sunday) Phil Kline's boombox holiday procession has taken root in cities from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Sydney, Australia. But the original one, now a tradition of 14 years' standing, begins at Washington Square Park and moves, its boomboxes chiming with Mr. Kline's specially prepared cassette tapes, through the East Village in an event that's part caroling party, part meditation. Meets at 6:45 p.m. at the Washington Arch; procession begins at 7 and continues to Tompkins Square Park. No tickets necessary, but try to bring a boombox.

(Dunning)    CADEN MANSON/BIG ART GROUP (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday through Thursday) ''House of No More'' re-enacts a crime from many perspectives, sometimes contradictory. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $15 and $25. (Anderson)    ELIZA MILLER AND CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS (Tomorrow) In a shared program that is part of the theater's informal free ''DraftWork'' series, Ms. Miller will present a piece loosely based on the Roman Catholic requiem Mass, and Mr. Williams will present dances about male saints and the effect of traditional Catholicism on intercultural gay relationships. 3 p.m. Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. (Dunning)    * 'THE NUTCRACKER' (Tonight through Sunday, and Monday through Thursday) The New York City Ballet in George Balanchine's perennial holiday favorite, with ever-shifting casts. ''The Nutcracker'' is on until Dec. 30, and then on Jan. 3 regular winter-season repertory begins. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, www.nycballet.com; $20 to $99. (Rockwell)    PASCAL RIOULT DANCE THEATER (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Rioult's unusual perspective on familiar pieces of choreography and music will be seen in the program's presentation of his reworked ''Firebird,'' ''Bolero'' and his ''Wein,'' set to Ravel's ''Valse.'' Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens, (718) 760-0064; $37; $33 for 65+; $20 for students. (Dunning)    SOUNDANCE, INC./VANESSA PAIGE DANCE (Tomorrow) Ms. Paige specializes in dance theater pieces, and this program includes some funny-sounding works, among them one about people who believe that they have a direct line to God (sound familiar?) and another on Christmas shopping fatigue. 8 p.m., Soundance at the Stable, 281 North Seventh Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 946-1771; $12; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning)    'A TRIBUTE TO MURRAY LOUIS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) An enduring presence in New York dance for about five decades, Mr. Louis created a demanding and distinctive modern-dance style that will be seen here in his ''Schubert,'' ''Index ( to necessary neurosis)'' and ''Four Brubeck Pieces,'' performed by members of the Boston Conservatory Dance Theater. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College, East 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)    * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Kyoto, Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Roberta Smith)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Smith)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Grace Glueck)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter)    * Museum of Modern Art : 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,'  through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * The Museum for African Art: 'Lasting Foundations: The Art oF Architecture in Africa,' through Jan. 6. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)    * New York Public Library: 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS,' through Feb. 12. Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069. (Smith)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)    The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through March 12. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: Uptown    Charles Biederman: 'Works from the Thirties' One of the most interestingly maverick and talented of between-the-wars American Modernists, Biederman left New York in 1942 for Minnesota, where he continued to make art and write art theory until his death in 2004. This small exhibition of biomorphic abstract paintings and one glossy construction of squares and knobs from the 1930's shows what an excellent student he was of European Surrealism and Constructivism. Meredith Ward, 60 East 66th Street, (212) 744-7306, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    GEORGE GROSZ: 'HIS VISUAL AND THEATRICAL POLITICS' This small banquet of George Grosz's drawings from 1914 to 1930 -- before he came to the United States -- shows his work in two arenas, for publication and for the stage, at the height of his wit and moral indignation. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500, through Dec. 23. (Glueck)    * Claes Oldenburg This excellent show of works from the 60's by this seminal Pop artist includes paint-splattered objects like oversize sneakers and a slice of pie à la mode and soft, stuffed objects like a toilet and a giant house key. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through Dec. 23.(Johnson)    Richard Pousette-Dart: 'Presences: The Imploding of Color' Though routinely associated with Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart had metaphysical and symbolist interests that distinguished him from better-known members of that group. In the 1960's and 70's, he turned to what you might call Pointillist Color Field Painting, and though the sensuous impact of light, color and thickly stippled paint is strongly asserted, the works are also animated by intimations of cosmic mysticism. Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    CY TWOMBLY: 'BACCHUS' Eight paintings deliver a red-hot visual tsunami via the artist's characteristic spiraling scribbles writ large across amazing, angry, joyful enveloping surfaces that are in the grand tradition of the aging painter letting it rip. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, through Dec. 23. (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Abetz/Drescher The Berlin-based collaborators Maike Abetz and Oliver Drescher paint large, busily detailed pictures of Renaissance ruins densely populated by fashion models, broken guitars and televisions and naked figures from pagan myth in a style you might call Psychedelic Pre-Raphaelite. Though not impressive formally or technically, they do capture a certain wildly eclectic and deeply narcissistic state of youthful consciousness. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Carolina Raquel Antich: 'All of a Sudden' An Argentinian who lives in Venice, where she was included in last summer's Biennale, Ms. Antich makes extremely spare paintings and drawings of children that exude moods of such sweet innocence that you can't help suspecting something malevolent lurking just beyond the outer edges of her imagery. Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Dave Cooper: 'pictorial ruminations on the volume and density of mostly pillowy girls' Comically weird illustration is enjoying great popularity among artists under 40. The Ottawa-based Mr. Cooper is a master of the genre. His manically surrealistic paintings and drawings of toothy, pop-eyed women in hectic situations mix attraction and repulsion with infectious verve. Jonathan Levine, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 243-3822, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    Gwen Hardie: 'Face Paintings' Each of Ms. Hardie's quietly arresting, medium-size canvases depicts a much enlarged part of someone's face -- an eye, a nose, the top of a lip -- realized in thin layers of smudgy color. Detail is suppressed, and the paintings veer toward an evocatively blurry and enigmatic generalization that verges in some cases on abstraction. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 947-2818, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    BYRON KIM: 'ODDLY FLOWING' Most interesting in this rambling show by an artist who made a splash in the early 1990's by comparing the skin tones of different people in monochromatic canvases are his photographic assemblages under the rubric of ''What I See.'' These impressions of important places in his life, like the one of his backyard in Park Slope, Brooklyn, have a sweet, nostalgic poignancy. Each is the result of a 360-degree sweep with a digital camera, with the images reassembled into an intensified whole. They tweak the landscape in lively fashion. But the show needs focus; the inclusion of other, unrelated works weakens its impact. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999, through Dec. 23. (Glueck)    TIM NOBLE & SUE WEBSTER: 'THE GLORY HOLE' The latest gimmickry from this British art team consists of metal scrap assemblages that conjure up 1950's junk sculptures and, properly lighted, cast shadows of the artists' faces or bodies in profile. Briefly diverting side-show humanism. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, through Dec. 23. (Smith).    Lari Pittman New, weirdly antic pictures of domestic interiors rendered in a luminous, splintery Cubist style by this Los Angeles-based painter are visually captivating and poetically mysterious. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    Paula Scher: 'The Maps' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)    Catherine Sullivan: 'The Chittendens' In a multiprojection video work, professional actors, none speaking, perform scripted sequences of actions. At first the effect is comical, but humor is overridden by an academic mission to deconstruct codes of behavior in film, theater and real life. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    * Zarina Zarina Hashmi was a nomad long before a peripatetic way of life became art-world fashion. Now in her 60's, she was born in India, has spent long stretches of time in other parts of Asia, and in Europe and Latin America. Even after making New York City her base in the 1970's, she kept on the move, and the semiabstract, minimalist art in this beautiful show is about self-location, past and present, in the face of constant change. Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, 11th floor, Chelsea, (212) 989-7074, through Dec. 23. (Cotter)    Galleries: SoHo    * JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending into a kind of rabbit hole on a ladder. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    Other Galleries    'Traffic' As usual for its big group exhibitions, Exit Art's current Biennial, this one devoted to the theme of traffic -- vehicular and otherwise -- is messy, youthful, noisy, crowded and entertaining. Highlights include a miniature model of a sidewalk construction site walkway by Chantel Foretich; portraits of 10 New York art dealers -- i.e., art traffic controllers -- by Tom Hébert; a finely made plywood tower mimicking a mold for pouring concrete highway bridge supports, by Mike Wsol; a set of ceramic train cars by David Packer; and many variously amusing, tedious and distracting videos. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    Last Chance    JOHN GRAHAM: 'SUM QUI SUM' A rare survey of an artist whose ideas and eye were crucial to avant-garde American art in the 1930's and 40's reveals a painter who roamed through Modernism but was most original when he connected to his lifelong obsession with women. Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, closing on Thursday. (Smith)    * 'Mfengu' The power of female creativity courses through this exquisite show of South African garments at Axis Gallery. All but one of the skirts and capes were made for, and by, women of the Mfengu cultural group. In every case, the surfaces are ornamented with lines of beadwork, as fine and taut as compass needles. Agnes Martin would have adored the elegant probity of this work, and its message of strength in restraint. Axis Gallery, 453 West 17th Street, fourth floor, (212) 741-2582, closing Thursday. . (Cotter)    * 'The Women of Giacometti' This museum-quality show of paintings and sculptures focuses on Alberto Giacometti's curiously asexual representations of his mother, sister, wife and other women in his life. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, closing tomorrow.

8,"The filmmaker John Waters has always found warmth and joy in the profane. In his garish films like ''Pink Flamingoes'' and ''Hairspray,'' he has also shown a keen instinct for finding the sweet spot where rock and schlock merge in ecstatic, trashy musical expression. It should come as no surprise that his antidote for depression surrounding this season's rampant commercial greed is to revel in its excesses -- and to subvert its pieties. This year, he has put together a live musical revue inspired by the wonderfully weird songs on his new collection of scavenged holiday nuggets, ''A John Waters Christmas'' (New Line). The director himself will be on hand offering his insight and reactions to songs like a Baltimore DJ's local hit ''Fat Daddy (Is Santa Claus),'' as well as a vanity recording of ''Happy Birthday Jesus'' by someone named Little Cindy, and the novelty cut ''Santa Claus Is a Black Man'' by AKIM & the Teddy Vann Production Company. Joining Mr. Waters in his celebration are two perfect co-conspirators. The Trachtenberg Family Slideshow Players -- the father, mother and daughter act (above, from left, Tina Piña Trachtenberg, Rachel Piña Trachtenberg and Jason Trachtenberg) who are performing their own holiday send-up, from Dec.18 to Dec. 23 at Performance Space 122 -- will sprint over from that earlier gig to add their hipster family values to Mr. Waters's mix.

(Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble case as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BACH AT LEIPZIG' Itamar Moses's comedy is an ardent but hollow literary homage to Tom Stoppard stuffed with arcana about religious and musical squabbles in 18th-century Germany and knowingly feeble jokes. Despite the nimble gifts of a first-rate cast, the play never works up the farcical energy to lift us over the puddles of book-learning (2:15). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE GENTLEMAN DANCING-MASTER'  The Pearl Theater Company is having way more fun than a company specializing in classics ought to have with this 17th-century comedy by William Wycherley. Marsha Stephanie Blake is terrific as a young woman betrothed to her cousin but hot for someone else; the loons who surround her are great, too (2:50). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but all others will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (2:15). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

(Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BROKEN JOURNEY' A gripping production of a modern-day rendering of ''Rashomon'' by a British poet and playwright who employs clever wordplay to define the characters and delve into their psyche. A solid cast manages to hold the tension taut for most of the 110 minutes. Theater Three, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, closing tomorrow. (Wilborn Hampton)    'HAMLET' Michael Cumpsty gives a forceful, intelligent reading of the title role in the Classic Stage Company's likably intimate production of Shakespeare's tale of doom-struck Danes. Brian Kulick's production is heavy on the directorial gimmickry (Smell the spray paint! Watch the set be shredded!), leaving psychology and philosophy to fend for themselves (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100, closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AEON FLUX' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Adapted from MTV animated shorts from a decade ago, this glossy, incoherent movie sends Charlize Theron 400 years into the future, where she runs around and does somersaults in a spandex body suit. (A. O. Scott)    'BE HERE TO LOVE ME' (No rating, 99 minutes) Margaret Brown's documentary biography of the brilliant, deeply troubled Texan singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt is a tender, impressionistic labor of love. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE BOYS OF BARAKA' (No rating, 84 minutes) If you take the boy out of the inner city, you stand a good chance of taking the despair and hopelessness of the inner city out of the boy: that's the message sent by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's documentary about a group of boys from the slums of Baltimore who spend a year studying at a school in rural Kenya. (Holden)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Holden)    'DÍAS DE SANTIAGO' (No rating, 83 minutes, in Spanish) Pietro Sibille captivates as a frustrated Peruvian veteran in this promising debut by Josué Méndez. (Nathan Lee)    * 'DOWN TO THE BONE' (No rating, 105 minutes) ''Down to the Bone,'' which won the Special Jury Prize at last year's Sundance Festival, is the kind of movie most independent films strive in vain to be: a small, beautifully faceted gem. Vera Farmiga gives a pitch-perfect performance as Irene, a mother of two whose life is precariously built around a cocaine addiction. (Dana Stevens)    * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter Off Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife and a young screenwriter. (Holden)    'FAR SIDE OF THE MOON' (No rating, 105 minutes, in French) An alternating rewarding and frustrating drama about two brothers who find themselves in each other's gravitational pull after the death of their mother. From the noted Québécois stage director Robert Lepage. (Dargis)    'FIRST DESCENT' (PG-13, 110 minutes) This nostalgic, hyperbolic, intermittently spectacular look at the history of snowboarding makes for middling documentary but excellent sport porn. (Lee)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warm-hearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'IN THE MIX' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This predictable, one-dimensional romantic comedy is all about its star, Usher, who plays a New York D.J. beloved by one and all. Beautiful women lust after him, but when a Mafia princess (Emmanuelle Chriqui) joins their number, her mobster father (Chazz Palminteri) disapproves. Even though Darrell (Usher) once took a bullet for him. (Anita Gates)    'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the 1991 Persian Gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'JUST FRIENDS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) In this crude, clobbering comedy, a former geek who has reinvented himself as a Hollywood smoothie (Ryan Reynolds) returns to his New Jersey hometown to win his high school dream girl (Amy Smart). (Holden)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of Los Angeles noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)    'THE LEGEND OF ZORRO' (PG, 126 minutes) Like most sequels, this successor to ''The Mask of Zorro'' feels obliged to outperform its forerunner by being bigger, faster and more spectacular. That translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic. (Holden)    'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    BRIGHT STARS, BIG CITY: CHINESE CINEMA'S FIRST GOLDEN ERA, 1922-1937 (Through Dec. 22). The Museum of Modern Art continues its celebration of early Chinese film and Shanghai's movie stars. This weekend's silent classics include ''Coming Home'' (1934), a psychological drama about a man with two wives; ''The Goddess'' (1934), starring Ruan Lingyu, sometimes called the Chinese Garbo, as a mother driven to murder; and ''The Pearl Necklace'' (1926), based on a Guy de Maupassant story about theft and embezzlement.

(Laura Sinagra)    FIONA APPLE (Tonight) As a teenage singer-songwriter, Ms. Apple made provocative therapy pop, combining a bad girl's desire with the sad damage of a violence victim.

(Sinagra)    THE COMAS, SAM CHAMPION (Wednesday) Like a lot of indie-rock bands, the Comas seem tentative about really trying. But when they do, as on the best cuts from last year's dreamy ''Conductor'' (Yep Roc), their portrayals of wage slavery and lolling slacker lust exude an intriguing passive-aggression. The ambling 90's slacker-rock nostalgists Sam Champion open. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra)    CORMEGA, KILLAH PRIEST (Tomorrow) The raw, observant Cormega is part of the Queensbridge rap crew that spawned lots of other acts, but he's never gained more than cult and critical fame.

(Sinagra)    DISTURBED, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Playing nu-metal in the late 90's, the Disturbed proffered the same combination of hard-rock riffs and lyrical complaints that fueled bands like Slipknot.

(Sinagra)    EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) This Midland, Tex., band makes melancholy instrumental music in the vein of Godspeed You Black Emperor, but perhaps a little more contemplative.

(Sinagra)    MARK MALLMAN (Monday) The Minneapolis keyboardist Mark Mallman would mythologize himself into relevance if he could: his day-and-a-half ''marathon'' shows in his hometown have set Guinness world records for ''longest song.'' But this high-voltage showman has some glam-pop chops too. 8:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $7.

Her girl-next-door-meets-plastic-fashionista vibe is enhanced with top producers' hip-hop beats. The R & B singer Ciara tries to fill the shoes of Aaliyah, a singer who could ride hip-hop beats with a conspiratorial, low-key urgency. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $75.00.

This is the original lineup: the vocalist Exene Cervenka, the vocalist and bassist John Doe, the guitarist Billy Zoom and the drummer D. J. Bonebrake. Ms. Hatfield's voice, that of a weary but urgent ingénue, added sharp charm to the music of the Blake Babies in the 80's and her own opinionated, confessional solo projects after that. 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $29.50 in advance, $34 at the door.

(Chinen)    * CECIL TAYLOR'S AHA (Wednesday through Dec. 18) The leonine father figure of free-jazz piano has lost none of his percussive fire, as he'll demonstrate with this large ensemble, which includes such stalwart improvisers as the trumpeter Taylor Ho Bynum, the drummer Tony Oxley and the trombonist Steve Swell. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30 to $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    CEDAR WALTON TRIO WITH ROY HARGROVE (Tuesday through Dec. 18) As a pianist and composer, Mr. Walton heeds an articulate, almost courtly variety of hard-bop; he's at his best when his forms spark solos from collaborators like Mr. Hargrove, the charismatic young trumpeter. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

Opera    'AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY' (Monday) Tobias Picker's much anticipated opera, based on Theodore Dreiser's landmark 1925 novel, a rare Metropolitan Opera commission, breaks no new ground for musical originality and dramatic inventiveness. This is an unabashedly conventional melodrama. Whole stretches of Mr. Picker's Neo-Romantic score would not be out of place on Broadway. Still, with an effective libretto by Gene Scheer that reduces the 900-page novel to its essential narrative strands, ''An American Tragedy'' has its own kind of sweep and passion. And every time Mr. Picker summons his modernist vein, the music becomes more challenging and consequently more involving. The production by Francesca Zambello, with its three-tiered set, is impressive to see and flows deftly. And the cast could not be better, with the dashing baritone Nathan Gunn as Clyde Griffiths, the ambitious social climber; the soprano Patricia Racette as the wistful factory worker Roberta; and the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the moneyed and dazzling Sondra. James Conlon conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LA BOHÈME' (Tonight and Thursday night) The Metropolitan Opera's production receives its last two performances of the season. The dependable Hei-Kyung Hong is Mimi, and the sturdy tenor Roberto Aronica sings Rodolfo. Alexandra Deshorties is Musetta; Vladimir Chernov is Marcello. Philippe Auguin conducts. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205. (Jeremy Eichler)    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) ''Carmen'' will sell tickets no matter who is in it. Denyce Graves has now resumed one of her signature roles, while Ruth Ann Swenson appears as Micaëla, a role that seems something of a departure for her. Don José tomorrow is Marcello Giordani, who should excel in the role; on Wednesday, it's Marco Berti, who has a very loud voice and no particular grace. Erwin Schrott is Escamillo, and Philippe Jordan remains the crisp and able conductor. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets, $26 to $220. (Anne Midgette)    'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Make way for the new love couple: this weekend is New York's chance to see whether Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón can live up to all their hype. Certainly they're talented young singers with that increasingly rare quality, box-office power. The title role is cast less prominently, with Carlo Guelfi; Eric Halfvarson is Sparafucile, and Asher Fisch conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office. (Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Several important chamber music bases are touched this week at this floating concert hall on the East River. Tonight, Daniel Shindarov, a violinist, and Sergey Silvansky, a pianist, play showpieces by Beethoven, Spohr, Wieniawski, Shostakovich, Glière and Igor Frolov. A quintet -- flute, strings and piano -- takes over tomorrow and Sunday to perform a handful of Martinu's tasty chamber scores and the Dvorak Piano Quartet. On Thursday, the texture shifts to that of a string quartet, for an evening devoted to Beethoven's first three quartets (Op. 18, Nos. 1-3). Tonight and tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30, Sunday at 4, Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $25 for students tonight and Thursday; $40 tomorrow and Sunday. (Allan Kozinn)    CHAMBER MUSIC AT THE Y (Tuesday and Wednesday) Peter Serkin is the visiting pianist at this concert of Schubert's ''Trout'' Quintet and the Brahms Piano Quartet in A. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Bernard Holland)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Wednesday) The Chamber Music Society reconvenes with music by Haydn, Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky in a concert called ''Quartets and Colleagues.'' 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 875-5788; $30 to $52. (Holland)    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow and Sunday) Frederick Renz leads his ambitious period-instrument band in a program titled ''A Bohemian Christmas,'' featuring 14th- and 15th-century motets from Bohemia, among other music, and the ''Messe de Notre Dame'' by Guillaume de Machaut.

(Eichler)    EIGHTH BLACKBIRD (Tomorrow) This virtuosic, inventive ensemble celebrates its 10th anniversary by revisiting pieces that have been in its repertory for some time -- Frederic Rzewski's ''Moutons de Panurge,'' Derek Bermel's ''Tied Shifts'' and Fred Lerdahl's ''Fantasy Études,'' for example -- and offering new works by Marcus Maroney, Jennifer Higdon and Ashley Fure. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $30.

(Holland)    JUILLIARD CENTENARY (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) The celebrations move to Carnegie Hall this weekend, with performances by Juilliard faculty and students. Tonight in Zankel Hall, the pianists Joseph Kalichstein and Brian Zeger are joined by vocal and instrumental students in works by Brahms, Ravel, Rossini and Wolf. Tomorrow, again in Zankel, the Juilliard String Quartet performs Ezequiel Viñao's Quartet No. 2, commissioned by the school, and then joins forces with students for the Mendelssohn Octet. And on Sunday in Isaac Stern Auditorium, James Conlon leads some combined forces in Mahler's colossal Symphony No. 3. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $10 to $25. (Eichler)    JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its idiosyncratic founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and either familiar works or lesser-known scores by well-known composers. This week the fare includes Rachmaninoff's rich-hued ''Trio Élégiaque,'' as well as Josef Suk's ''Elegy'' and a Wind Quintet by Josef Bohuslav Foerster. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259; $10 to $25.

(Holland)    BEJUN MEHTA (Tonight) Mr. Mehta is one of the sweetest and more mellifluous singers in the countertenor vocal category; he appears in concert at the Temple of Dendur in a wide-ranging program of German and English songs. 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $60. (Midgette)    NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Tonight and Sunday) Clara Longstreth, the music director of the New Amsterdam Singers, has a gift for putting together rewarding programs of the old and the new. Even for this weekend's holiday program, Ms. Longstreth and her choristers are presenting an unusual program of ''gentle carols and syncopated songs,'' as the news release puts it, alongside the mellow music of Vaughan Williams and Randall Thompson. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Immanuel Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 88th Street, (212) 842-1511; $20; $15 for 65+; $10 for students. (Tommasini)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Taking a leaf from the Vienna Philharmonic's book, the orchestra splits itself in two so that it can be two places at once. While some of its musicians are on their home stage playing works by Haydn and Mozart under the baton of Christian Zacharias -- who will also be the piano soloist in Mozart's B-flat Concerto (K. 456) -- the rest will be uptown at Riverside Church performing Handel's ''Messiah'' with Richard Hickox conducting, and the Westminster Symphonic Choir providing choral heft for an attractive solo roster that includes Christine Brandes, soprano; Sara Mingardo, contralto; Mark Tucker, tenor; and John Relyea, bass-baritone. The Haydn and Mozart program is at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, $26 to $94; the ''Messiah'' performances are at 7:30 p.m. at Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 120th Street, Morningside Heights, $27 to $70; (212) 721-6500. (Kozinn)    CHRISTOPH PRÉGARDIEN (Sunday) The German tenor Christoph Prégardien has won acclaim for his elegantly lyrical and penetrating performances of the art song repertory. Here with the pianist Dennis Helmrich, he performs Schubert's ''Winterreise,'' and it should be interesting to hear how he adapts his refined singing style to this bleakly affecting and, by the end, shattering song cycle. 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Tommasini)    ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tuesday and Thursday) Of all the ''Messiah'' performances that blossom around New York in the weeks before Christmas, this one -- sung by a choir of men and boys and accompanied by period instruments -- is the one that shouldn't be missed. John Scott, the new choral director at St. Thomas, leads the performance by the church's choir and Concert Royal. The soloists are Ellen Hargis, soprano; James Bowman, countertenor; Marc Molomot, tenor; and Thomas Meglioranza, bass. 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360; $30 to $80; $25 for students and 65+.

(Eichler)    TALLIS SCHOLARS (Tomorrow) This magnificent early-music choir honors its namesake, Thomas Tallis, in the second installment of a 500th-birthday tribute. Included on the program are some of Tallis's most sublime sacred works -- the Missa Puer Natus Est Nobis and the Lamentations I -- as well as works by John Taverner and William Byrd. 8 p.m., Church of St. Paul the Apostle, Columbus Avenue at 60th Street, (212) 854-7799; $35. (Kozinn)    TRINITY CHOIR (Sunday) In the cornucopia of holiday ''Messiahs,'' this is a reliable standout, as well as the one with the longest tradition: ''Messiah'' received its American premiere at Trinity Church in 1770. It also has a special claim to authenticity, not only because of the Rebel Baroque Orchestra but also because the conductor, Owen Burdick, follows Handel's own conducting cues. 3 p.m., Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, (212) 279-4200; $25 to $45. (Midgette)    TRIO MEDIAEVAL (Tomorrow) Lest anyone be misled by the name of a group that specializes in music new and old, this excellent a cappella group, fresh from a fine performance in the recent Bang on a Can opus ''Shelter'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is now offering a more conventional concert with, as usual, a focus on contemporary composers to balance out the 14th-century fare. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38. (Midgette)    WAVERLY CONSORT (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''A Christmas Story'' is one of this venerable group's oldest traditions, combining music from around Europe with narrative in the manner of a medieval church play. 1 and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290; $45.

Museums    Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20, the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * The Museum for African Art: 'Lasting Foundations: The Art oF Architecture in Africa,' through Jan. 6. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. An evocative film of the annual replastering of the great Mosque of Djenne, the largest adobe building in the world, is an inspired bonus: a vision of an architectural monument as love object. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)    * P.S. 1: 'The Painted World,' through Jan. 30. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' This museum, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, is a oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)    The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through March 5. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray and artworks in various media relating to chess by Dorothea Tanning, Alberto Giacometti and John Cage, whose chessboard incorporates musical notation for a piano composition that you can hear on headphones. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    * Claes Oldenburg This excellent show of works from the 60's by this seminal Pop artist includes paint-splattered objects like oversize sneakers and a slice of pie à la mode and soft, stuffed objects like a toilet and a giant house key. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through Dec. 23.(Johnson)    * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)    CY TWOMBLY: 'BACCHUS' Eight paintings deliver a red-hot visual tsunami via the artist's characteristic spiraling scribbles writ large across amazing, angry, joyful enveloping surfaces that are in the grand tradition of the aging painter letting it rip. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, through Dec. 24. (Smith).    Galleries: 57th Street    Glenn Kaino An installation by this West Coast Conceptualist features a big chessboard made of wooden squares taken from gun ammunition boxes and bronze playing pieces made from casts of the artist's hand signaling friendly and unfriendly intentions. On the walls hang grisaille portraits of famous chess players, each painted in one hour. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Carolina Raquel Antich: 'All of a Sudden' An Argentinian who lives in Venice, where she was included in last summer's Biennale, Ms. Antich makes extremely spare paintings and drawings of children that exude moods of such sweet innocence that you can't help suspecting something malevolent lurking just beyond the outer edges of her imagery. Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Dave Cooper: 'pictorial ruminations on the volume and density of mostly pillowy girls' Comically weird illustration is enjoying great popularity among artists under 40. The Ottawa-based Mr. Cooper is a master of the genre. His manically surrealistic paintings and drawings of toothy, pop-eyed women in hectic situations mix attraction and repulsion with infectious verve. Jonathan Levine, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 243-3822, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort-of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith).    * 'Mfengu' The power of female creativity courses through this exquisite show of South African garments at Axis Gallery. All but one of the skirts and capes were made for, and by, women of the Mfengu cultural group. In every case, the surfaces are ornamented with lines of beadwork, as fine and taut as compass needles. Agnes Martin would have adored the elegant probity of this work, and its message of strength in restraint. Axis Gallery, 453 West 17th Street, fourth floor, (212) 741-2582, through Dec. 22. (Cotter)    David Salle: 'The Vortex Paintings' Each of Mr. Salle's new, disappointingly bland paintings features the image of a woman distorted into an almost illegible spiral, with neatly painted objects like hats and seashells floating in front, and, in some cases, comic book panels copied from a pornographic version of Disney's ''Snow White'' in the background. Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, through Dec. 17. (Johnson)    * Zarina Zarina Hashmi was a nomad long before a peripatetic way of life became art-world fashion. Now in her 60's, she was born in India, has spent long stretches of time in other parts of Asia, and in Europe and Latin America. Even after making New York City her base in the 1970's, she kept on the move, and the semiabstract, minimalist art in this beautiful show is about self-location, past and present, in the face of constant change. Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, 11th floor, Chelsea, (212) 989-7074, through Dec. 23. (Cotter)    Galleries: SoHo    * JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending into a kind of rabbit hole on a ladder. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)    Other Galleries    MERLIN CARPENTER: 'A ROARING RAMPAGE OF REVENGE' In a case of ''biting the hand'' that is more mild joke than roaring rampage, this show consists of paintings made by the ever-irreverent British artist in concert with the gallery's owners. On each, the chief image is a review of a previous exhibition at the gallery. Although not small, they are presented in a stack leaning against the wall that the viewer can browse through, as through a file of clippings, or arrange as desired. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, through Dec. 18. (Smith)    Last Chance    ROBERT HENRI: 'THE PAINTED SPIRIT' This large survey of portraits by the early, early Modernist painter and teacher who alerted many of his fellow Americans to the gestural and tactile possibilities of paint (Stuart Davis, for example), spans much of his career, from commissioned portraits to nudes to his sympathetic renderings of Irish children, American Indians and Spaniards of many persuasions. A certain academicism sometimes intercedes, but his vigorous love of paint as paint, absorbed from Velásquez, Goya and Manet and conveyed to these shores just when it was needed, still astounds. Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    Jennifer Stillwell Recently shortlisted for the Sobey Art Award, Canada's version of England's Turner Prize, this Winnipeg-based sculptor makes savvy, scruffy installations from materials you could buy at Wal-Mart and Home Depot. The main attraction here consists of more than 40,000 paper towel squares that were torn off rolls and neatly stacked by 15 volunteers. A video documents the process of creation. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783, closing Sunday. (Johnson)    TWIXT TWO WORLDS Organized by Ricky Jay, the eminent magician, actor, writer, bibliophile and historian of magic, this fascinating, sepulchral exhibition documents the conflict and collusions between magicians and spiritualists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with Harry Houdini and the magicians coming out ahead. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, Chelsea (212) 462-2668, closing tomorrow.
