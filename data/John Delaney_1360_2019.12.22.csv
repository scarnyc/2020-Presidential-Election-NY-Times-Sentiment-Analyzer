Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)    'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)    'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)    'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)    'DURANGO'  In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)    'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Molière's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    Off Off Broadway    'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing Cliff's Notes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart and tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' It's hard to improve on Dickens, and the playwright Bathsheba Doran doesn't manage to in the Theatreworks/USA production of her version for families and children. Directed by Will Pomerantz, scenes fly by too fast, and Kathleen Chalfant's Miss Havisham should be frightening rather than eccentric. But as her icy protégée, Estella, Kristen Bush is near perfect (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    'JOB'S PASSION' The Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin's blending of two biblical characters, Job and Jesus, sometimes flaunts irreverence for irreverence's sake but finds both dizzying humor and rich meaning in human misery (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'ROMANIA. KISS ME!' A worthwhile collection of six short plays by young Romanian playwrights who grew up after the fall of Ceausescu's regime (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Jason Zinoman)    'WOYZECK' This improbably vivacious London-born production of Buchner's great, prophetic drama of existential emptiness finds the bleak rhythm of life in, of all things, the music of Elvis Presley. While Daniel Kramer's production is more flash than feeling, it features a first-rate, gymnastically stylized performance from Edward Hogg in the title role (2:20). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closing on Sunday . (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabián Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott)    'BACKSTAGE' (No rating, 112 minutes, in French) Beautifully acted and uncomfortably believable much of the time, this close-up study of the toxic relationship of a narcissistic French pop star and a besotted teenage fan produces a feeling of emotional claustrophobia. (Stephen Holden)    'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis) 'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)    'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)    'DÉJÀ VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. ( Dargis)    'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)    'EATING OUT 2: SLOPPY SECONDS' (No rating, 85 minutes) A Rubik's Cube of shifting sexual orientation and elaborate fantasies, this film follows a young gay man who joins an ''ex-gay'' group in his quest to bed a hot male model. Gathering all the accouterments of soft pornography -- cheesy music, low-rent acting and attractively framed genitals -- into a plot of stunning imbecility, the director, Phillip J. Bartel, is most amusing in his zeal to demonstrate the fruitlessness of right-wing efforts to reorient gay men. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic exposé of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)    'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)    'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)    'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)    'INVISIBLE' (No rating, 86 minutes) Absent parents cause no end of bother in this moody thriller about an unhappily married couple, a remote cabin and a pair of homicidal crazies. Unfortunately, the director, Adam Watstein, is so invested in his theme of nature as emotional healer that the movie's abrupt transition from lush travelogue to murky violence feels jarring and unearned. As both victims and attackers trade abandonment issues ''Invisible'' suggests that weekend getaways are best approached, if not with a pistol, then at least with a firm grasp of psychobabble. (Catsoulis)    'LET'S GO TO PRISON' (R, 84 minutes) Sure, it has shower scenes, but they're sly and restrained rather than frat house obvious, and all the funnier for it. Dax Shepard is hilariously deadpan as a petty criminal who retaliates against a judge by contriving for the man's son (Will Arnett) to be arrested and then purposely being arrested himself so he can harass the prissy fellow. Chi McBride is perfect as a fellow inmate with a taste for prison lovin' and a voice like Barry White's. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'OUR DAILY BREAD' (No rating, 92 minutes) In this superb documentary the Austrian filmmaker Nikolaus Geyrhalter takes an unblinking, often disturbing look at industrial food production from field to factory. You are what you eat; as it happens, you are also what you dare to watch. (Dargis)    'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, this rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almódovar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    Film Series    JACQUES AUDIARD RETROSPECTIVE (Tuesday) Cinéma Tuesdays at the French Institute Alliance Française concludes its five-week tribute to Mr. Audiard, a contemporary master of the French thriller, next week.

This weekend's films include ''In the Heat of the Night'' (1967), Norman Jewison's Oscar-winning crime drama about racial tensions in the Deep South; ''West Side Story'' (1961), Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins's Oscar-winning adaptation of the Broadway musical; and ''Some Like It Hot'' (1959), Billy Wilder's comedy classic in which Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon all wear dresses.

(Gates)    MONDOVINO: THE SERIES (Through Dec. 10) Technically, ''Mondovino,'' Jonathan Nossiter's 10-hour documentary about winemaking, is one film. But the Museum of Modern Art is presenting its theatrical world premiere as five two-hour programs, beginning tomorrow. The story begins in Southern France, travels to Tuscany and the New World, and includes a portrait of the wine critic Robert Parker. An all-weekend marathon of the 10 parts is also scheduled.

RYAN ADAMS AND THE CARDINALS (Monday through Wednesday) No one exemplifies the frustrations of alt-country better: so much talent, so much rich history to draw on, so much arrogance. But at least Mr. Adams can deliver the goods. Within his unnecessarily voluminous output -- he released three full-length albums last year and posts new songs to his Web site by the dozen -- is some astonishingly beautiful work.

(Ben Sisario)    BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA (Tomorrow) After more than 60 years as a group, the Blind Boys of Alabama are no longer boys, but gray-haired pillars of gospel quartet singing. Led by Clarence Fountain, they proclaim their reverence in close harmonies and gutsy improvisations that leap heavenward. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $42.50 in advance, $45 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Sunday) This tuneless headache of a band, modeled on the jangly psychedelic rock of mid-1960s Britain and Los Angeles, was well on its way into obscurity when, two years ago, it was featured in a hit documentary, ''Dig!,'' and a legend was created. Since then the band has toured widely, to audiences who wait for its leader, Anton Newcombe, to lash out in paranoia and kick a fan in the head, as he did in the film. With A Place to Bury Strangers. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)    CONVERGE (Tonight) The guitar riffs of this Boston band come like a spray of machine gun bullets, rapid and unrelenting. The violent rasp of Jacob Bannon, the singer, is just as deadly. With Some Girls, Modern Life Is War, and Blacklisted. At 6, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario)    COPELAND (Sunday) Rueful piano ballads that lead to teary, guitar-drenched, not-quite-cathartic peaks: the songs of this Florida band strongly resemble those of Coldplay and Keane. But while its passion is sincere, Copeland lacks something in the sophistication department. (''I'm in love with my doubt/It's freaking me out.'') With Appleseed Cast, Owen and Acute. At 6:45 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)    GENO DELAFOSE AND FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Monday) Geno Delafose, the son of the zydeco accordionist John Delafose, holds on to the traditions of an older generation, pumping waltzes and two-steps and blues on his button accordion, keeping the old bayou flavor. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6; Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Pareles)    DINOSAUR JR. (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, a juxtaposition that prefigured Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums reunited last year, sounding brawny and vigorous; their first album together in 18 years is to be released in the spring. At 9, Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $25. (Sisario)    EL VEZ (Tomorrow) Most Elvis imitators are corny; El Vez is conceptual, merging Presleyana, Mexican-American in-jokes and bad puns to honor and simultaneously twist the Presley legacy.

(Pareles)    JEREMY ENIGK (Thursday) In the 1990s Mr. Enigk was the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, a Seattle group that did as much as anybody to transform emo from a relatively obscure offshoot of hardcore punk into the populist form of yearning and tantrum-throwing that it is today. This fall he released his first solo album in a decade, ''World Waits'' (Lewis Hollow).

(Pareles)    * THE GRATES (Wednesday) Playful and capricious, this guitar-drums-vocals trio from Brisbane, Australia, led by the frequently airborne Patience Hodgson, reaches back to classic 1990s riot grrrl for its passionate amateurism. But on its ambitious debut album, ''Gravity Won't Get You High'' (Cherrytree/Interscope), the band is unburdened by any legacy, going from hip-swaying sassy to defiant and tough, all with a sense that nothing in life is worth getting too upset about (''No I'll never believe the truth in you/Lies are much more fun''). With the White Rabbits, Tigercity and Cassettes Won't Listen. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario)    JOAN JETT AND the blackhearts (Tomorrow) With a never-changing arsenal of meaty riffs, sneering looks and defiant declarations of sexual independence, Joan Jett, now in her late 40s, has been expertly playing the tough-chick-with-a-guitar role longer than many of her younger imitators have been alive. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)    JUNIOR BOYS (Thursday) When dance music goes sad: squiggly, awkward beats and droopy keyboards surround the forlorn vocals of this Canadian electronic group, who sing about missed birthdays and phones that don't ring. Also on the bill is a D.J. set by Morgan Geist. At 9 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $15. (Sisario)    KLEZMATICS (Monday) This veteran New York band has had a major influence on the bohemian rediscovery and reinvention of klezmer music, the somewhat jazzy dance music of Eastern European Jews. So it made perfect sense when Nora Guthrie, the daughter and archivist of Woody Guthrie, approached the members a few years ago to write music for lyrics that Guthrie wrote in the 1940s and '50s, when he lived on Coney Island with his second wife, Marjorie Mazia, and her Jewish family. There the Dust Bowl troubadour ate blintzes, lighted the menorah and wrote about Hanukkah in the plainspoken, unmistakably Guthrie style: ''It's honeyky Hanukkah, shaky my hand/My candles are burning all over this land.'' The Klezmatics play these songs, as collected on a new album, ''Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' (Jewish Music Group). At 7:30 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, henrystreet.org/arts; $20. (Sisario)    DAVID KRAKAUER'S KLEZMER MADNESS (Tomorrow) Well into an illustrious career as a classical clarinetist, Mr. Krakauer stumbled onto klezmer, and his endless curiosity in adapting it to avant-garde jazz, rock and even Latin styles has brought him a wide new audience. For this concert he collaborates with Fred Wesley, the funk trombonist who was a key member of James Brown's band in the 1960s and '70s; and with SoCalled, a k a Josh Dolgin, a Canadian D.J. and keyboardist whose efforts at infusing hip-hop with Jewish identity -- or perhaps the other way around -- include an album, ''The SoCalled Seder'' (JDub). At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $35. (Sisario)    LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Tonight) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960s boogaloo, '70s Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rap, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. At midnight, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $23. (Pareles)     * LOW (Wednesday) With exquisite care, this band from Duluth, Minn., featuring the husband-and-wife team of Alan Sparhawk on guitar and Mimi Parker on vocals, and Matt Livingston on bass, creates hushed, stark songs on a vast sonic scale. This concert is advertised as a special performance with a variety of unnamed ''musical friends.''

(Sisario)    MARITIME (Sunday) Founded by former members of the Promise Ring and the Dismemberment Plan, two foundational emo bands of the mid-90s, Maritime plays understated and effortlessly catchy songs with minimal touches of acoustic guitar and new-wave keyboards. With Tall Hands. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $10. (Sisario)    * LE MYSTÈRE DES VOIX BULGARES (Sunday) Formed in 1952 as the Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir (but known since the '80s by this considerably sexier name, originally an album title), this group performs complex modern arrangements of traditional Bulgarian folk and Byzantine liturgical styles. The concept is high, but the effect of the pungently close harmonies and intense percussive yips is immediate and transcendent. At 7:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)    NEW MODEL ARMY (Wednesday and Thursday) New Model Army, an English band founded in the early 1980s by the songwriter Justin Sullivan, has held onto the vehement idealism and revved-up guitars of the British punk-rock pioneered by the Clash.

(Pareles)    OTEP (Monday) These Ozzfest vets play brutal noise-metal but are notable mainly for their leader, Otep Shamaya, a smallish woman with the voice of a roaring bear who wears T-shirts with slogans like ''strong aggressive female'' and sings about sexual abuse. With Ground to Machine. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario)    * 'RED HOT + RIOT LIVE' (Tonight and tomorrow night) A tribute to the inimitable Fela Kuti, the Nigerian master of Afrobeat who, on dozens of albums from the early 1970s until his death from AIDS nine years ago, merged James Brown's funk with the chants and polyrhythms of Africa, and used his music as a populist political cudgel against corrupt authority. The lineup for this concert, a benefit for the African Services Committee, an AIDS and H.I.V. support group, includes Tony Allen, Fela's longtime drummer; the eclectic Nigerian duo Amadou and Mariam; Cheikh Lo, from Senegal; Meshell Ndegeocello, the American bassist and funk ambassador; Dead Prez, a politically minded rap duo from Brooklyn; Keziah Jones, a Nigerian singer-songwriter; and Yerba Buena, a New York Latin band, playing with the jazz-funk keyboardist John Medeski. At 7:30, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $25 to $65. (Sisario)    THE STILLS (Tonight and tomorrow night) On its debut album three years ago, this Montreal band took the sulking guitar minimalism of New York groups like Interpol and the Strokes and sublimated it into a shimmering, majestic gloom that recalled the glories of U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen. Its most recent album, ''Without Feathers'' (Vice), perplexingly slows things down to a bored crawl. With Au Revoir Simone and Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin tonight, and Favourite Sons and A Brief Smile tomorrow night.

(Sisario)    UMPHREY'S McGEE (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the few jam bands to gain critical respect in the rock world, Umphrey's McGee, from South Bend, Ind., seamlessly incorporates the irregular meters and gnarled guitar patterns of classic progressive rock into the smoother, more spoonful-of-sugar textures more common in its milieu, a feat of reconciliation that impresses the connoisseurs and keeps everybody else on their feet. At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door.

Opera    'LA BOHÈME' (Tonight and Tuesday) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Bohème'' returns to the Met for its regular airing. Rolando Villazón, the charismatic Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although he seems somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. But sparks should fly on Tuesday when Anna Netrebko, the gorgeous Russian soprano, sings Mimi. Tonight Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano, offers a warm-voiced, robust Mimi. Mr. Villazón's mentor and idol, Plácido Domingo, leads the orchestra in a fine, lively performance. Anna Samuil replaces Susannah Glanville as Musetta both nights, and Peter Coleman-Wright is her jealous lover, Marcello. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 and $140 tickets remain for tonight; Tuesday is sold out. (Vivien Schweitzer)    * 'DON CARLO' (Monday and Thursday) James Levine will be in the pit when Verdi's noble masterpiece returns to the Met in John Dexter's production. The Met has assembled what looks to be a top-tier cast, with the powerhouse tenor Johan Botha singing the title role for the first time with the company; Patricia Racette as Elisabeth; Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo; René Pape as Philip II; Olga Borodina as Eboli; and Samuel Ramey as the Grand Inquisitor. At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)    'IDOMENEO'  (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In place of the dramatic tenor Ben Heppner, the clarion-voiced tenor Kobie van Rensburg takes over the title role in Mozart's noble opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' which has returned to the company's roster in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized and effective 1982 production. There are two other cast changes: the elegant mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena sings Idamante, and the bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties sings the volatile Elettra. Best of all, Dorothea Röschmann, a superb soprano, returns as Ilia. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini)    'LORD BYRON'S LOVE LETTER'/'THE VILLAGE SINGER' (Wednesday) The operatization of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' by André Previn might have obscured the fact that Tennessee Williams did write a single opera libretto of his own. It's ''Lord Byron's Love Letter,'' set by the composer Raffaello de Banfield, first performed in 1955 and nearly forgotten since. Now the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater continues its cultivation of neglected American opera by bringing the work (which is about, what else, dotty old Southern ladies) back for its New York premiere, on a double bill with Stephen Paulus's ''Village Singer.'' Ari Pelto conducts. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+.

(Midgette)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. She resumes the role for the season's final performance tomorrow, paired with the Cavaradossi of Walter Fraccaro and the Met's perennial Scarpia these days, James Morris. The real news is the conductor Nicola Luisotti in his first Met season, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220. (Midgette)    Classical Music    * AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Ton Koopman leads his period instrument orchestra and choir, along with a slate of vocal soloists (Lisa Larsson, soprano; Bogna Bartosz, alto; Jörg Dürmüller, tenor; and Klaus Mertens, bass) in a program that includes Magnificat settings by Bach and Buxtehude; Bach's ''Jauchzet, frohlocket, auf preiset die Tage,'' from the ''Christmas Oratorio''; and Corelli's ''Christmas'' Concerto Grosso in G minor.

Now, with their new CD, ''Gloryland,'' they are continuing the exploration of traditional American folk music they began with ''American Angels.'' On Thursday the women will be joined by Darol Anger, a violinist and mandolinist, and Scott Nygaard, a guitarist, for a program titled ''Long Time Traveling,'' featuring folk songs, shape-note tunes and gospel hymns. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 at the door.

Included are works by Fred Frith, Martin Bresnick, Julia Wolfe, Conlon Nancarrow, Thurston Moore and Don Byron. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $35.

(Kozinn)    * ELIOT FISK AND THE MIRÓ QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Fisk plays guitar with energy, intensity and precision, qualities that the Miró players are likely to match in this program of Spanish music. Included are Arriaga's String Quartet No. 3, Leonardo Balada's Caprichos No. 2 and Boccherini's Quintet No. 4 for guitar and strings, best known for its zesty fandango. Mr. Fisk will also play some solo guitar music. At 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $45. (Kozinn)    JUAN DIEGO FLÓREZ (Tonight) The darling of the Metropolitan Opera these days, this Peruvian tenor is making a Carnegie Hall recital debut that Carnegie Hall, interestingly, is not presenting. Mr. Flórez's voice can be a little bleaty for some tastes, but it's always thoughtfully, carefully produced, with clean coloratura and excellent musicianship. His program includes Mozart, Fauré, Massenet, Bizet, Rosa Mercedes Ayala de Morales, Donizetti and, of course, Rossini, his signature composer. At 8, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $95.

Six composers have been invited to write orchestra concertos inspired by Bach's ''Brandenburgs.'' Stephen Hartke, the arresting California-based composer, starts things off with ''A Brandenburg Autumn,'' which will receive its premiere on this program, alongside, naturally, three Bach concertos: the ''Brandenburgs'' Nos. 1 and 2, and the Keyboard Concerto in D minor with the pianist Jeremy Denk.

(Dunning)    KNUA DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday) This South Korean dance company, whose name is the acronym for the Korean National University of the Arts, will make its New York City debut in a program that includes choreography by Hyun Ja Kim, Mina Yoo, Balanchine (''Allegro Brillante'') and Petipa (the pas de deux from ''Diana and Acteon''). At 7 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning)    * LUIS LARA MALVACÍAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Twenty-one short sections make up ''There Is No Such Thing,'' a new work from this talented Venezuelan choreographer, who tends to approach dance as visual art, and whose work can sometimes seem as much installation as performance. At 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+.

This week, check out works in progress by Jennifer Monson, Kathy Westwater and Regina Rocke. At 8 p.m., 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 598-0551, movementresearch.org. (La Rocco)    * MOVEMENT RESEARCH IMPROVISATION FESTIVAL (Friday) This is less a showcase than a freewheeling exploration of the art of physical improvisation, with a roster of strongly individual performers and curators. (Through Dec. 10.) At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $12. (Dunning)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker'' continues until Dec. 30, with eight performances this week alone. It may be hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to speak of the orchestra and the stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., Tuesday though Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell)    The Parsons Dance Company (Tuesday through Thursday) David Parsons brings his high-energy company to the Joyce with two programs performed over a two-week period. Highlights include ''The Nascimento Project,'' a new collaboration with the Brazilian musician Milton Nascimento; a revival of ''Ring Around the Rosie,'' last seen in New York more than a decade ago; and ''In the End,'' set to music by the Dave Matthews Band. (Through Dec. 17.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42. (La Rocco)    * STREB S.L.A.M.

(Dunning)    'TRIBUTE TO BUTOH II' (Tonight and tomorrow night) This series, a homage to the Butoh artist Kazuo Ohno on his 100th birthday, continues with dances by Tanya Calamoneri, Leigh Evans, Mana Hashimoto and Akiko Bo Nishijima. At 8, CRS Center, 123 Fourth Avenue, at 12th Street, East Village, (212) 677-8621; $15; $10 for students. (Dunning)    JOHANNES WIELAND (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Wieland, known for his stylish, sleekly hard-charging modern-dance choreography, will present ''Progressive Coma,'' a new multimedia piece about the power of images in the media. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $20.

Mr. Zustiak and his dance company, Palissimo, will present ''Le Petit Mort/Now It's Time to Say Goodbye,'' which he describes as a ''postmortem ecstasy somewhere between a dream and a memory.'' Tal Yarden has contributed the video component of this multimedia work. (Through Dec. 10.) At 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are ''Dead Dad,'' a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and ''Man in a Boat,'' in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, all produced since the early 1990s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. Though wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this popular artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)    * Frick Collection: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Velázquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbarán and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Smith)    * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum's loopy ramp. It's carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. The show's big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)    * Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter)    * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    New-York Historical Society: 'New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War,' through Sept. 3. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Edward Rothstein)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'John Latham: Time Base and the Universe,' through Jan. 8. This retrospective of John Latham, who died this year at 84, suggests a series of nesting time capsules. It spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham's work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of ''Cluster'' sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. ''The N-U Niddrie Heart'' (around 1990), in which ''The Pregnancy Survival Manual'' and ''Vanished Species'' are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Martha Schwendener)    Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense,the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists, including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith)    Whitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. (See above.) (Cotter)    Galleries: Chelsea    Fred W. McDarrah: 'Artists and Writers of the 60s and 70s' This show of more than 100 photographs by the former Village Voice photographer and picture editor Fred W. McDarrah opens with a shot of Jack Kerouac and some frolicsome women at a 1958 New Year's Eve bash. It is hastily grabbed and opportunistic, like much of Mr. McDarrah's work, for he operated independently, rarely working on assignment. There are groupings of artists in their studios (Alice Neel, Philip Guston, Jasper Johns); actors (Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro on the set of ''Taxi Driver''); and musicians (Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan). Mr. McDarrah's best-known image may be his 1965 close-up of Bob Dylan, dressed all in black and saluting, his countenance as earnest as that of a battle-hardened marine. It is an enduring symbol of the era's antiwar protests, rebellion and counterculture. Steven Kasher Gallery521 West 23rd Street, (212) 966-3978, stevenkasher.com, through Jan. 5. (Genocchio)    Other Galleries    * 'Political Cartoons from Nigeria' Most of the drawn and painted images here are single-panel lampoons of past and present social inequity and corruption in Nigeria. Nearly all are by Ghariokwu Lemi, famous for his 26 superb, incident-filled album covers for Fela Kuti. For the occasion, the artist introduces two younger colleagues, Comfort Jacobs and Lordwealth Ololade, to New York. Without at all resembling him in style, they follow his sharp commentarial lead. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through Dec. 17. (Cotter)    Last Chance    STEVE MUMFORD: 'THE WAR IN IRAQ' This exhibition of paintings is based on Mr. Mumford's field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images -- they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting. Postmasters Gallery, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727 3323 or www.postmastersart.com; closes tomorrow.

Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'BUTLEY'  In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)  'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it(2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)  'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)  'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to a demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap opera contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)  'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)  'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)  'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)  'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)  *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)  'DURANGO'  In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood)  * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' It's hard to improve on Dickens, and the playwright Bathsheba Doran doesn't manage to in the Theatreworks/USA production of her version for families and children. Directed by Will Pomerantz, scenes fly by too fast, and Kathleen Chalfant's Miss Havisham should be frightening rather than eccentric. But as her icy protégée, Estella, Kristen Bush is near perfect (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)  'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)  'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)  'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)  'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)  'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. o.e. (Gates)  'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)  'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)  'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)  'ROMANIA. KISS ME!' A worthwhile collection of six short plays by young Romanian playwrights who grew up after the fall of Ceausescu's regime (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)  'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Molière's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates)  * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'JOB'S PASSION' The Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin's blending of two biblical characters, Job and Jesus, sometimes flaunts irreverence for irreverence's sake but finds both dizzying humor and rich meaning in human misery (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109. (Gates)  'WOYZECK' This improbably vivacious London-born production of Buchner's great, prophetic drama of existential emptiness finds the bleak rhythm of life in, of all things, the music of Elvis Presley. While Daniel Kramer's production is more flash than feeling, it features a first-rate, gymnastically stylized performance from Edward Hogg in the title role (2:20). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)  'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart and tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)  'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)  'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)  'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)  Last Chance    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Gates)  * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)  'HOME FRONT' Fletcher McTaggert gives a gut-wrenching performance in Daniel Algie's updated Greek tragedy about the family of a soldier missing in action in Vietnam (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Gates)  'THE INTERNATIONALIST' Anne Washburn's quirky comedy follows in the woozy footsteps of an American businessman abroad as he tries to transact business personal and professional through a sturdy language barrier. Ms. Washburn's oblique style is initially intriguing, ultimately wearisome. (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)  'LIVE GIRLS' Victoria Stewart's drama sends up the docudrama and an Anna Deavere Smith-like performance artist (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)  'MY DEAH'  ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)  'SPEEDMOUSE' Two guys from Australia working in remarkable synchrony create wildly funny slapstick out of sound effects and mime (1:20). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabián Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)  'BACKSTAGE' (No rating, 112 minutes, in French) Beautifully acted and uncomfortably believable much of the time, this close-up study of the toxic relationship of a narcissistic French pop star and a besotted teenage fan produces a feeling of emotional claustrophobia. (Stephen Holden)  'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)  * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis)  'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)   'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, ''Ruby in Paradise,'' to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Holden)  'DANCE PARTY, USA' (No rating, 66 minutes) During a Fourth of July weekend in Portland, Oregon, a pair of disaffected 17-year-olds are nudged toward adulthood in a movie that favors natural drift over artificial drama. When Gus (Cole Pensinger) meets the more mature Jessica (Anna Kavan), his journey from crass lady-killer to sensitive boyfriend begins. Directed with extraordinary empathy by Aaron Katz (who also wrote the story), this admittedly slight movie is given heft by a plaintive tone and a camera fascinated by emotional shifts and shadows. (Jeannette Catsoulis)  'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)  'DÉJÀ VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. ( Dargis)  'ENCOUNTER POINT' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Arabic, Hebrew and English) Ronit Avni's documentary about Israelis and Palestinians working toward reconciliation is assured, thoughtful, clear-eyed and even hopeful. (Anita Gates)  * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic exposé of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories, all taking place mainly in the fictional town of Cody, Colo., examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)  * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)  'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this unassumingly named film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)  * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)  'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)  'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. Despite its abundant merriment, it is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)  'FUR: AN IMAGINARY PORTRAIT OF DIANE ARBUS' (R, 122 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as the famous photographer, and Robert Downey Jr. plays her imaginary furry friend. Steven Shainberg directs from a screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson. (Dargis)  'A GOOD YEAR' (PG-13, 117 minutes) This sun-dappled romantic diversion is a major departure for its director, Ridley Scott, and for its star, Russell Crowe. Mr. Crowe is miscast as a ferocious London bond trader who mellows after inheriting a French vineyard. It's a three-P movie, for pleasant, pretty and predictable. Add a fourth P, for piddling. (Holden)  'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)  'HARSH TIMES' (R, 119 minutes) Christian Bale turns in a spectacular technical performance as a war veteran running amok on the streets of South Central Los Angeles and dragging along his best friend (Freddy Rodriguez) on the road to hell. The losers in the directorial debut of David Ayer (who wrote ''Training Day'') are too repellent for you to waste time feeling sorry for. (Holden)  'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)  'LET'S GO TO PRISON' (R, 84 minutes) Sure, it has shower scenes, but they're sly and restrained rather than frat house obvious, and all the funnier for it. Dax Shepard is hilariously deadpan as a petty criminal who retaliates against a judge by contriving for the man's son (Will Arnett) to be arrested and then purposely being arrested himself so he can harass the prissy fellow. Chi McBride is perfect as a fellow inmate with a taste for prison lovin' and a voice like Barry White's. (Neil Genzlinger)  'THE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis)  * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)  'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, the rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden)  * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almódovar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)  'WHO THE $#%& IS JACKSON POLLOCK?' (PG-13, 74 minutes) This entertaining documentary follows the decade-long campaign of Teri Horton, a former truck driver, to prove that an unsigned painting she purchased at a thrift shop for $5 is an authentic Jackson Pollock that could be worth $50 million. Self-serving experts are lined on both sides. (Holden)  * 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune.

(Jon Pareles)   * THE BRAVERY, RADIO 4 (Wednesday) Disco first met punk in Britain in the late '70s, but they have had quite a romance in turn-of-the-21st-century New York. The Bravery emerged about two years ago with a battery of catchy, radio-ready songs and buckets of hair gel; the band has been compared, accurately, to the Strokes, Interpol, New Order, U2 and Franz Ferdinand. Radio 4 was among the first local bands to mine the sound of postpunk British groups like the Gang of Four, which it does studiously but not very imaginatively. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out.

(Sisario)  DISCO BISCUITS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Disco Biscuits, from Philadelphia, have worked their way up the jam-band circuit with blithe rock that veers toward funk and jazz; hovers in circling, hypnotic riffs; and sometimes turns into a live version of electronic dance music, replacing computer drumbeats with muscle. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $32 in advance, $37 at the door. (Pareles)  ¡FORWARD, RUSSIA! (Tuesday) At first glance this young band from Leeds, England, seems awfully severe: sharp, angular artwork modeled on the early Soviet avant-garde, and songs named by number (''Twelve'' was its first hit). Its lyrics aren't exactly Beach Boys material, either (''it's another obsidian bloodbath''). But the jabby guitars and jerky disco-punk beat, derived from groups like Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party, are really nothing but good old rock 'n' roll fun. With Snowden and Meneguar. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $14.

At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $60. (Sisario)  THE HOLD STEADY (Tonight) Like a meeting of AC/DC and the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock, while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I've heard about original sin,'' he sings. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; sold out. (Sisario)  HOT TUNA (Tomorrow) The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from Jefferson Airplane, but it has now long outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis, with Mr. Casady's bass shadowing him from below. At 7:30 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $39.50 and $49.50.

Rachel Fuller, a British songwriter, will present this informal musical salon with her companion, a little-known guitarist named Pete Townshend. ''In the Attic'' is usually a live Web cast from Mr. Townshend's studio, but recently Ms. Fuller has been doing it on the road while the Who has been on tour.

(Sisario)  MERCURY REV, NICOLAI DUNGER (Thursday) It doesn't get any more grand than Mercury Rev, a veteran group from upstate New York that luxuriates in a rich, almost spiritual psychedelia, its every guitar chord and vocal part offered upward like a prayer. (The band gets grandiose, though: on its last tour, a screen carried life-lesson bromides from the likes of ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull.'') Mr. Dunger, a Swedish balladeer with serious Van Morrison envy, makes earnest entreaties for romance and existential relief in a tremulous tenor.

(Sisario)  * PEACHES (Tonight) For Peaches, a former Canadian schoolteacher who became the uninhibited queen of electroclash, sex is everything: liberating force, political energy, social equalizer. Rap-singing over sparse, nervy electronic beats, she is a dance-floor dominatrix who demands pleasure, and demands it her way. (''Just one thing I can't compromise/I want to see you work it guy-on-guy.'') With Quintron and Miss Pussycat.

(Sisario)  SAM ROBERTS BAND, JASON COLLETT (Monday) Sam Roberts, from Montreal, plays big-chord, big-heart rock anthems in the tradition of the Who, with an earnestness that is as much asset as liability (''my love for you is as deep as a coal mine''). Mr. Collett, a sometime member of the Toronto indie collective Broken Social Scene, draws inspiration from Bob Dylan and the Allman Brothers, among others. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)  THE SOUNDS (Tonight) Sweden has a strong heritage of dedicated rockers playing lean, tough music. It's also one of the capitals of bubblegum pop, and those two worlds meet, somewhat jarringly, in the Sounds, who about 80 percent of the time sound like graduates of the Academy of Joan Jett, and the rest of the time play a kind of dance-pop (''Tony the Beat'') clean enough for the prom. With Shiny Toy Guns. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)  * TEXAS IS THE REASON (Tomorrow and Sunday) Emo is now old enough to have reunion concerts. Texas Is the Reason, which might be called proto-emo, was formed in New York by two Hare Krishnas in 1994 and dissolved three years later; in between it played an influential kind of therapeutic hardcore punk made of big, chunky guitars and unabashedly vulnerable vocals. The band has gotten back together for what it says are only two shows, which are, of course, sold out. With Ian Love and Jon Sass. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com. (Sisario)  STEVE TYRELL (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell belongs to a latter-day breed of rock singer who has belatedly embraced popular standards. The breed includes Rod Stewart (whose records Mr. Tyrell co-produces), Michael Bolton and Dr. John (for whom he sometimes sounds like a vocal double). At 8:45, with additional shows tonight, tomorrow and Thursday night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $90 cover, dinner required. (Stephen Holden)  FRANKIE VALLI (Tonight through Sunday) Newly re-enshrined by ''Jersey Boys,'' a success on Broadway even as most other shows based on pop stars have failed -- does anyone remember ''Lennon''? -- Mr. Valli sings at the Rose Theater, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center, joined as always by his Four Seasons. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $75 to $125. (Sisario)  JERRY JEFF WALKER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jerry Jeff Walker wrote the hit ''Mr. Bojangles,'' but around his home-stomping grounds of Texas, he's the easygoing, gruffly avuncular icon of the cosmic cowboy mentality, all about spacing out in the wide-open spaces. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. (Pareles)  * ZS, DIRTY PROJECTORS (Tonight) A meeting of two of the strongest avant-garde bands in New York. The Zs' songs sputter forth in Morse code dots of percussion and saxophone, and Dirty Projectors, led by Dave Longstreth, build elaborate ''glitch operas'' with stark pluckings of guitar and strings, precise harmonies and Mr. Longstreth's warbling, ecstatic tenor, all arranged slightly out of whack. At 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $10. Dirty Projectors also play tomorrow at 8 p.m., with Ecstatic Sunshine and Beautiful Weekend, at the Syrup Room, 100 Ingraham Street, at Porter Avenue, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $10.

REZ ABBASI AND SNAKE CHARMER (Tuesday) On his new album, ''Bazaar'' (Zoho), the guitarist Rez Abbasi infuses Southeast Asian motifs with jazz flexibility, rock bombast and the swirl of a Hammond B-3 organ. Here Mr. Abbasi reconvenes much of the album's stellar cast, including the Punjabi singer Kiran Ahluwalia, the Dutch tenor and soprano saxophonist Marc Mommas and the Colorado-reared alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa.

(Nate Chinen)  DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Thursday) As the name implies, this big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a style that genuflects to Steve Reich minimalism as well as to orchestral jazz in the descent of Bob Brookmeyer. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, between Houston and Bleecker Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 614-0505, bowerypoetry.com; cover, $12. (Chinen)  GARY BARTZ/MULGREW MILLER (Monday) Mr. Bartz is an alto saxophonist with a searching approach, and Mr. Miller is a pianist with an earthy style. Post-Coltrane modality will most likely play a part in their duets, along with some well-conceived original tunes. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)  GENE BERTONCINI (Wednesday) ''Quiet Now,'' a solo guitar album issued by Ambient Records last year, was a perfect showcase for Mr. Bertoncini's tasteful virtuosity. He is performing not only in that unaccompanied setting but also in a trio (Ike Sturm on bass, Mark Ferber on drums), basing his repertory on standards of the Brazilian and classical canons as well as on American song. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20.

He holds court at the refurbished Minton's this weekend, with a rhythm section.

(Chinen)  DAVID GILMORE (Tomorrow) Mr. Gilmore recently issued an album called ''Unified Presence'' (RKM) that showcases both his dazzlingly fluid guitar playing and his rhythmically convoluted compositions. Here he strips his group down to a core of Brad Jones on bass and Rudy Royston on drums. At midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  * DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND/NEW ORLEANS JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The clarinetist and saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera, the trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the pianist Cyrus Chestnut are a few of the high-wattage players in the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band. But the chief attraction of this concert is the premiere of ''Rising Tide,'' a topical commission by the trumpeter Irvin Mayfield, for his New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $35 to $58.

(Chinen)  * RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA QUARTET (Thursday) ''Codebook'' (Pi), the latest album by the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, investigates the topic of cryptography, not necessarily the most promising theme for an improviser. What lifts the project off the ground is the brazen imaginative exertion of his band, which is appearing with one substitution: Craig Taborn, who ably fills in on piano for Vijay Iyer. At 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)  PAT MARTINO (Wednesday and Thursday) On ''Remember,'' his latest Blue Note album, Mr. Martino pays homage to one of his guitar heroes, Wes Montgomery.

At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  MEDESKI MARTIN SCOFIELD & WOOD (Tonight and tomorrow night) Eight years ago the guitarist John Scofield began his jam-band crossover career with ''A Go Go'' (Verve), an album that cast Medeski Martin & Wood in an accompanying role. Now Mr. Scofield is touring as an equal partner with the groove trio in support of ''Out Louder'' (Indirecto), an altogether superior new release.

Talat, also celebrating a new album, is a comparably less established ensemble with a promising lineup, including the trumpeter Matt Shulman and the saxophonist Marc Mommaas.

(Chinen)  PHAROAH SANDERS (Thursday) Mr. Sanders, an authoritative ambassador of the 1960s avant-garde, has never stopped imbuing his performances with the tone of a spiritual quest; he has worthy acolytes in the pianist William Henderson, the bassist Nat Reeves and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. (Through Dec. 3.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)  * MARIA SCHNEIDER JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday night) Evocative harmonic coloration and swirling rhythmic undercurrent are two of the chief devices of this large ensemble, led by the composer Maria Schneider. Its ranks include improvisers like the tenor saxophonist Rich Perry and the pianist Frank Kimbrough, but its strength lies in a virtually unsurpassed degree of cohesion. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an additional 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30. (Chinen)  TANGO MEETS JAZZ FESTIVAL (Thursday) The overlap between American jazz and Argentinean tango provides a premise for this quartet engagement featuring the pianist Pablo Ziegler, a protégé of the peerless tango composer Astor Piazzolla. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30. (Chinen)  * HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Tonight through Sunday night) The august composer and multi-reedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre. These days he indulges it best in this superb ensemble, which finds his flute and alto saxophone in conversation with Liberty Ellman's acoustic guitar, Jose Davila's tuba and trombone, Dana Leong and Rubin Kodheli's cellos, and Elliot Humberto Kavee's drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $20; members, $10. (Chinen)  VISION CLUB SERIES (Tomorrow) This off-season outreach of the Vision Festival presents Survival, featuring the saxophonist Henry Warner, the bassist William Parker and the drummer Rashid Bakr (at 7:30); and a separate free-jazz trio led by the saxophonist Charles Gayle (at 9). At 7:30 and 9 p.m., Clemente Soto Velez, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; cover, $10 per set. (Chinen)  DAVID WEISS AND POINT OF DEPARTURE QUINTET (Tonight and Thursday) An assertive trumpeter and an accomplished arranger, David Weiss leads a post-bop ensemble stocked with prime talent: J. D. Allen on tenor saxophone, Nir Felder on guitar, Luques Curtis on bass, and either Jamire Williams or Justin Brown on drums. Tonight at midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    Classical  Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tonight and Monday) Bartlett Sher's breezy new production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia'' conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast. Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. Diana Damrau is a vocally brilliant and feisty Rosina. Juan Diego Flórez could not be more adorable as the amorous Count Almaviva, though his voice sounds pinched and shaky at times. Maurizio Benini conducts a fleet and stylish performance. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)  'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Bohème'' returns to the Met for its regular airing. Rolando Villazón, the talented Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although his voice and charisma are somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. Mr. Villazón's mentor and idol, Plácido Domingo, leads the orchestra in a fine, lively performance. Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano, makes her house debut as a warm-voiced, robust Mimi. Cynthia Lawrence replaces Susannah Glanville as Musetta, and Peter Coleman-Wright is her jealous lover, Marcello. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 and $320 tickets remain. (Vivien Schweitzer)  * 'DON CARLO' (Thursday) James Levine will be in the pit when Verdi's noble masterpiece returns to the Met in John Dexter's production. This is a work Mr. Levine reveres and has conducted magnificently over the years. The Met has assembled what looks to be a top-tier cast, with the powerhouse tenor Johan Botha singing the title role for the first time with the company; Patricia Racette as Elisabeth; Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo; René Pape as Philip II; Olga Borodina as Eboli; and Samuel Ramey as the Grand Inquisitor. At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175. (Tommasini)  'IDOMENEO' (Wednesday) In place of the dramatic tenor Ben Heppner, the clarion-voiced tenor Kobie van Rensburg, who made an impressive Met debut two years ago in Handel's ''Rodelinda,'' takes over the title role in Mozart's noble opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' which has returned to the company's roster in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized and effective 1982 production. There are two other cast changes: the elegant mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena sings Idamante, and the bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties sings the volatile Elettra. Best of all, Dorothea Röschmann, a superb soprano, returns as Ilia. James Levine conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini)  'RIGOLETTO' (Tonight through Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. This weekend it concludes its run of Verdi's ''Rigoletto.'' The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)  'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) To many, she's the last of the Golden Age sopranos: Aprile Millo is taking over one of her signature roles for two performances this week at the Metropolitan Opera. Walter Fraccaro is her Cavaradossi; James Morris seems to have become the Met's perennial Scarpia. The conductor Nicola Luisotti should be a fine match for Ms. Millo: both approach this piece, which can seem merely a hoary war horse, as if it actually mattered. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Tuesday. (Anne Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) The programming edges toward contemporary chamber music at this floating concert hall this weekend, before moving on to the standard repertory on Thursday. Tonight at a ''cushion concert'' -- you lounge on cushions rather than on the usual folding chairs (although chairs will be available for older listeners who prefer them) -- a piano trio plays works by Ives, Shostakovich, Chick Corea and Bright Sheng. The trio's pianist, Steven Beck, stays on tomorrow and Sunday to perform the Korngold Piano Quintet with the Manhattan String Quartet, on a program that also includes the Ives Quartet No. 1 and Smetana's ''In My Life.'' On Thursday the violinist Mark Peskanov, the flutist Massimo Mercelli and the violist Maurycy Banaszek play Mozart, Beethoven and C. P. E. Bach. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4; Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $15 tonight; $40 tomorrow and Sunday; $35 on Thursday. (Allan Kozinn)  ANDREA BOCELLI (Thursday) This wildly popular Italian tenor brings his act to an appropriate site. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171, thegarden.com; $69.50 to $129.50. (Bernard Holland)  RUTH CUNNINGHAM (Thursday) This former member of Anonymous 4 sings a program of her own music, along with Western and Eastern traditional chants, and improvisation, to her own accompaniment on harp, flute, recorder and piano. At 8 p.m., Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village, (212) 414-9419, ruthcunningham.com; $20. (Kozinn)  CHRISTINA JENNINGS AND PETER KOLKAY (Thursday) A flute and bassoon recital may not sound like a wild event. But two adventurous young musicians, the flutist Christina Jennings and the bassoonist Peter Kolkay, both recent winners of Concert Artists Guild prizes, promise a wild survey of contemporary works. Their program, sponsored by the Guild, was inspired, they report, by James Brown, Andy Warhol and the electric-era Miles Davis. There will be works by David Lang, Paul Moravec and Toru Takemitsu, among others. At 7:30 p.m., Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21. (Tommasini)  LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA (Monday and Tuesday) Kurt Masur, late of the New York Philharmonic, returns to the city with his close associates at the London Philharmonic for two programs: Liszt, Prokofiev and Brahms on Monday, and Sibelius and Beethoven on Tuesday. Elisabeth Leonskaja is the pianist for the first evening, Sarah Chang the violinist for the second. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $92. (Holland)  MIRÓ QUARTET (Wednesday) Music by the 18-year-old Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga from 1824, two years before his death, joins more familiar repertory from Shostakovich and Dvorak. This string quartet is presented by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $30 to $52. (Holland)  NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) New York's premier orchestra is back from its successful tour of Japan and Korea. And for the homecoming, the music director Lorin Maazel is offering what looks to be a perfunctory program. The pianist Joyce Yang is the soloist in Rachmaninoff's ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,'' heard last season in a dazzling account with the pianist Gabriela Montero. The program also includes Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony. Hmmm. Didn't Mr. Maazel begin the season with this piece? Thursday's program is somewhat more interesting, with works by Mozart, Hindemith, Roussel and Strauss. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96. (Tommasini)  URSULA OPPENS AND JEROME LOWENTHAL (Tuesday) These two superb pianists are joined by Michael Lipsey for Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. The program also includes works by Brahms and Schubert. At 10 a.m., LeFrak Concert Hall, Aaron Copland School of Music, Queens College, Kissena Boulevard at the Long Island Expressway, (718) 997-3802, qc.cuny.edu; $30. (Kozinn)  ANDREA PADOVA (Tuesday) Mr. Padova, an Italian pianist; Massimo Mercelli, a flutist; and James Houlik, a tenor saxophonist, play a program that includes Copland's ''Vocalise,'' Bernstein's ''Simple Song,'' Philip Glass's ''Sacred Taoist Dance'' and the United States premiere of the flute and piano arrangement of Mr. Glass's ''Façade.'' Mr. Padova will also perform a selection of his own compositions for piano and saxophone. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, merkinconcerthall.org; $25. (Schweitzer)    Dance  Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER (Wednesday and Thursday) This vibrant company's annual season, five weeks long, gets under way with a gala on Wednesday, followed by the first of the regular mixed bills the next night. The gala will include an important company premiere, Twyla Tharp's ''Golden Section,'' along with Ailey's ''Pas de Duke'' and his signature ''Revelations.'' Wednesday gala at 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 405-9031; $400 to $2,500. Thursday at 8 p.m., (212) 581-1212, alvinailey.org or nycitycenter.org; $25 to $150. (John Rockwell)  LEONIDES D. ARPON AND DAVID KIEFFER (Thursday) Mr. Arpon, who dances with Armitage Gone! Dance, will present three pieces, set to music by Zbigniew Preisner, Les Tambours du Bronx and Annie Gosfield. Mr. Kieffer, who has performed with Pascal Rioult, will present works set to Mozart, Vivaldi and Muslimgauze. (Through Dec. 3.) At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $18; $12 for students. (Jennifer Dunning)  * ARTHUR AVILES TYPICAL THEATER (Thursday) Mr. Aviles celebrates the 10th anniversary of his vibrant category-defying company with a new piece, ''Ear to the Ground,'' drawn from what was heard and felt by the choreographer and his dancers from the ground rumblings emanating from ''the concrete of the South Bronx, the floor of the dance studio, the common ground of social realities'' and other terrains, as Mr. Aviles put its. (Through Dec. 1.) At 8 p.m., Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, 841 Barretto Street, near Garrison Avenue, Hunts Point, the Bronx, (718) 842-5223, or bronxacademyofartsanddance.org; $15 and $20. (Dunning)  BALLET MESTIZO (Tonight through Sunday) This music and dance company will present ''Viva Colombia!'' (Through Dec. 10.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880, thaliatheatre.org; $25 for all tickets tonight; $30 tomorrow; $27 for students and 65+. (Dunning)  CITY/DANS: RISA JAROSLOW & DANCERS (Thursday) Risa Jaroslow has often focused on the idea of community in her work, and in ''Resist/Surrender'' she explores ideas about masculinity by bringing in a diverse group of nondancers (gay teenagers, New York City firefighters and corporate lawyers) to work with her troupe. Scott Johnson has composed an original score. (Through Dec. 3.) At 8.30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15; members, $10. (Roslyn Sulcas)  DADA VON BZDULOW THEATER (Tonight through Sunday night) In its American debut, this Polish dance-theater company presents ''Several Witty Observations (à la Gombrowicz),'' which explores themes in the writings of Witold Gombrowicz. At 7:30, La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $20; $15 for students. (Dunning)  * LUIS LARA MALVACIAS (Tuesday through Thursday) Twenty-one short sections make up ''There Is No Such Thing,'' a new work from this talented Venezuelan choreographer, who tends to approach dance as visual art, and whose work can sometimes seem as much installation as performance. (Through Dec. 2.) At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Sulcas)  * MOSCOW CLASSICAL BALLET (Sunday) Directed by Natalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasilyov, this Russian state-supported classical troupe will present a traditional production of ''The Nutcracker,'' complete with child dancers recruited from the Bronx Dance Theater. At 3 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $20 to $35. (Dunning)  MOVEMENT RESEARCH AT THE JUDSON CHURCH (Monday) This worthy series aims to provide a laboratory of sorts for choreographers, who can show works in progress without the pressure of having to provide a theater-ready show. It's a hit-or-miss experience, but there is always a possibility that the next undiscovered talent is close at hand. This week the choreographers are Ei Arakawa, Christal Brown and Barbara Mahler. At 8 p.m., Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, movementresearch.org; free. (Sulcas)  * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) It's that time of year. Tonight marks the first of 45 performances of George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker.'' It may be tough on the constantly rotating casts of dancers, but it's magic for the audience. (Through Dec. 30.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell)  JOHANNES WIELAND (Thursday) Mr. Wieland, known for his stylish, sleekly hard-charging modern-dance choreography, will present ''Progressive Coma,'' a new multimedia piece about the power of images in the media.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)   * BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'TROPICALIA: A REVOLUTION IN BRAZILIAN CULTURE,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)  BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Smith)  BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are ''Dead Dad,'' a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and ''Man in a Boat,'' in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)  * FRICK COLLECTION: 'DOMENICO TIEPOLO (1727-1804): A NEW TESTAMENT,'  through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)  * FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Velázquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbarán and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger's famous title, the show might be called ''Ways of Seeing Paintings.'' (See above.) (Smith)  * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,'  through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck)  * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO,' through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum's loopy ramp, still the weirdest-coolest place to look at art and at other people looking at art. It's carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. The show's big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)  METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AMERICANS IN PARIS: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)  THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)  MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)  * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)  * MOMA: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith)  * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Many objects were executed by the Wiener Werkstätte, an artists' collaborative that insisted on the handmade component of good design, founded by him with the painter and designer Kolomon Moser. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. And there are photographs of many buildings he designed, including the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, an ultraluxurious home for a millionaire that he considered his best Gesamkunstwerk. Though focused on interiors, the show conveys the basic ideas of a designer immersed in a new vision. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro-slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. The exhibition brings to a close the Historical Society's multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400.(Edward Rothstein)  * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)   * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith)  WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: KIKI SMITH: 'A GATHERING, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th St, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)    Galleries: Chelsea    STEVE MUMFORD: 'THE WAR IN IRAQ' Mr. Mumford this exhibition of paintings based on field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004, during which he was embedded with United States military units in Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images -- they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting. Some of his paintings combine drawings or photographs of events he witnessed and those that happened nearby, like his epic, cinematic work ''The Battle of Baquba'' (2006). Postmasters Gallery, 459 West 19th Street, through Dec. 2, (212) 727 3323 or www.postmastersart.com. (Benjamin Genocchio)    Last Chance    ERNESTO NETO: 'FROM WHAT WE ARE MADE' Mr. Neto presents his version of the miracle of human conception with a luminous white tent the shape of a rainbow, with a thick foam floor, filled with a pile of small, colorful soft sculptures made in pantyhose fabric and stuffed with buckwheat shells. As the viewer enters the space, the floor shifts and subsides, tossing the sculptures and making it hard to stay upright. It is like traversing a marshmallow or wading through a pool of jelly, though with the phantasmagoria of a funhouse in which we can climb and play. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)  * 'PHANTOM CAPTAIN: ART AND CROWDSOURCING' According to the curator Andrea Grover, ''crowdsourcing'' is a new form of corporate outsourcing that parcels out work to armies of amateurs, and the concept is applied to art in this smart little show of ultracolloaborative projects. Harrell Fletcher and Miranda July posted project assignments on their Web site, www.learningtoloveyoumore.com, and present the work of the respondents. Davy Rothbart edits a magazine made up entirely of found notes, photos and letters contributed by readers; a wall full of such material is here. Allison Wiese compiles and publishes books of recipes by artists. Aaron Koblin and Peter Edmunds ask any and all comers to try their hand at digital drawings. Joseph Beuys's assertion ''Everyone is an artist'' lives on. Apexart, 291 Church Street, near White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270; closes tomorrow.

'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' In previews; opens on Dec. 6. Fritz Weaver stars as the patriarch of a wealthy family in crisis in David Mamet's new adaptation of what may be Harley Granville Barker's finest drama (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it(2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to a demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap opera contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)    'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)    'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    'LIVE GIRLS' Victoria Stewart's drama sends up the docudrama and an Anna Deavere Smith-like performance artist (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    'MY DEAH'  ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000, (Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart and tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE BLUEST EYE' Toni Morrison's first novel is adapted by Lydia Diamond in a production aimed at young adults and teenagers. Sensitively acted, but it still feels like a book talking to us from the stage (1:30). Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'BUENOS AIRES IN TRANSLATION (BAiT)' Featuring four plays, this cross-cultural festival combines Argentinian writers and American directors, with mixed results. Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'EMERGENCE-SEE!' Daniel Beaty's solo show takes stock of the urban African-American mind in the new century, as dozens of men and women flock to Liberty Island when a slave ship mysteriously appears in New York Harbor. The performance captivates; the material doesn't (1:15). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE FLOOD' This eager, accomplished show about a devastating deluge in an Illinois town has a majestic score by Peter Mills and Cara Reichel and an able, ingratiating cast. Unfortunately, they're playing uninvolving, cookie-cutter characters (2:00). The American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Rob Kendt)    'LOVE, DEATH AND INTERIOR DECORATING' Theatergoers might want to arrive at intermission for this pair of one-acts by Keith Boynton. Though the first play is shallow and clumsy, the second, about a condemned revolutionary and his bourgeois lover, is fresh, literate and morally compelling (2:00). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Miriam Horn)    'THE MAIL-ORDER BRIDE' and 'THE IMAGINARY INVALID' Charles L. Mee has taken Molière's well-traveled hypochondriac, Argan, and given him a modern twist: the fellow thinks an Asian bride he has purchased will cure what ails him and give him back his youth. The Resonance Ensemble presents both the new work and the Molière classic in repertory, but it's the Molière (with an all-female cast) that works the best, thanks to Virginia Baeta's Argan. The actors in the Mee version never quite seem comfortable, which is too bad, because Mr. Mee packs the play with what should be good stuff. (Running time for each: 1:30.) The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'PORT AUTHORITY THROW DOWN' Mike Batistick's intercultural tale of an angry Pakistani cabdriver, a white Christian missionary from Ohio, a black homeless alcoholic and the driver's activist brother is far from profound, but it has some solid laughs, and its battered heart is in the right place (2:00). Culture Project at 45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Gates)    'STANLEY 2006' Todd D'Amour's performance art piece rethinks Stanley Kowalski's feelings about Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' The work is striking and original but at times frustrating and heavy on the angst (1:15). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Gates)    'THE SUNSET LIMITED' Cormac McCarthy's elegiac two-man play distills his previous work into a debate about suicide (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' The brilliant Twyla Tharp interprets the Bob Dylan songbook less than brilliantly. When a genius goes down in flames, everybody feels the burn (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned punch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'être is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis)   'CAUTIVA' (No rating, 108 minutes, in Spanish) This sober melodrama explores the aftereffects of Argentina's dirty war, which have a devastating impact on a teenage girl who discovers terrible secrets in her past. (Scott)    'THE CAVE OF THE YELLOW DOG' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Mongolian) The dog is cute, the children are adorable, and the sky seems to stretch on without limit, as does, unfortunately, the slight story from the Mongolian-born filmmaker Byambasuren Davaa. (Dargis)    * 'CLIMATES' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Turkish) The story of a man and a woman, one of whom murders the other's love, and a haunting portrait of existential solitude. The Turkish writer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan also stars. (Dargis)    'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, ''Ruby in Paradise,'' to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Stephen Holden)    'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis)    'DANCE PARTY, USA' (No rating, 66 minutes) During a Fourth of July weekend in Portland, Oregon, a pair of disaffected 17-year-olds are nudged toward adulthood in a movie that favors natural drift over artificial drama. When Gus (Cole Pensinger) meets the more mature Jessica (Anna Kavan), his journey from crass ladykiller to sensitive boyfriend begins. Directed with extraordinary empathy by Aaron Katz (who also wrote the story), this admittedly slight movie is given heft by a plaintive tone and a camera fascinated by emotional shifts and shadows. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'FUR: AN IMAGINARY PORTRAIT OF DIANE ARBUS' (R, 122 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as the famous photographer, and Robert Downey Jr. plays her imaginary furry friend. Steven Shainberg directs from a screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson. (Dargis)    'A GOOD YEAR' (PG-13, 117 minutes) This sun-dappled romantic diversion is a major departure for its director, Ridley Scott, and for its star, Russell Crowe. Mr. Crowe is miscast as a ferocious London bond trader who mellows after inheriting a French vineyard. It's a three-P movie, for pleasant, pretty and predictable. Add a fourth P, for piddling. (Holden)    'HARSH TIMES' (R, 119 minutes) Christian Bale turns in a spectacular technical performance as a war veteran running amok on the streets of South Central Los Angeles and dragging along his best friend (Freddy Rodriguez) on the road to hell. The losers in the directorial debut of David Ayer (who wrote ''Training Day'') are too repellent for you to waste time feeling sorry for. (Holden)    'THE MAGIC GLOVES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Depression, drugs and professional stasis commingle in this limp Argentine comedy whose characters remain trapped several rungs below their aspirations. In the foreground of a featureless Buenos Aires, paths cross and lock without import, and lives inch sideways (a cab driver becomes a bus driver), in reflection of the country's larger economic blight. Yet the fleeting moments of deadpan humor are pungent enough to suggest that the writer and director, Martín Rejtman, is saving himself for greater things. (Catsoulis)    * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)    * 'THE PRESTIGE' (PG-13, 128 minutes) Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's new film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman) practicing their art in late-Victorian London. Scarlett Johansson is the lovely assistant. (Scott)    'THE SANTA CLAUSe 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis)    * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)    'STRANGER THAN FICTION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Will Ferrell restrains his clownish impulses in this metaphysical comedy, directed with equal restraint by Marc Forster. Mr. Ferrell plays an I.R.S. agent who almost simultaneously falls in love with a baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and discovers that he is a character in an unfinished novel whose author (Emma Thompson) is planning to kill him. He seeks the help of a professor of literature played by Dustin Hoffman, who proves that scholarly criticism might not be a useless pursuit after all. (Scott)    'UMRAO JAAN' (No rating, 145 minutes, in Hindi and Urdu) Weak dubbing and melodramatic overkill hamper this retelling of a historical Indian story, about the travails of a performing courtesan. But its star, Aishwarya Rai, a potent presence, appears destined for international success. (Andy Webster)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almódovar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    * 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters. (Dargis)    Film Series    BLACK MARIA FILM FESTIVAL: 'THE LEGACY OF THE SHORT FILM' (Through Wednesday) The Museum of Modern Art is presenting eight programs of short films, all from the traveling New Jersey-based Black Maria festival. This weekend's programs include more than three dozen shorts, including Ken Kobland's ''Ideas of Order in Cinque Terre'' (2005), a paean to those Italian cliff towns; Vanessa Schwartz's ''Janitor'' (1993), a reinterpretation of the Bible; and Sam Green's ''Lot 63, Grave C'' (2005),which revisits the Rolling Stones tragic concert at Altamont, Calif.

At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98. (Stephen Holden)    ANI DiFRANCO (Tomorrow) Ms. DiFranco's articulate, uninhibited songs and poems are about staying true to her complicated self: feisty and vulnerable, polysexual, uncompromising and politically engaged, but never humorless. She can strum a guitar and sling words at hyperspeed, or swerve toward jazz and funk. In business (she runs her own label, Righteous Babe Records), as in her music, she's as independent as they come. With Hamell on Trial. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $47. (Jon Pareles)    * BOB DYLAN (Monday) On his 32nd studio album, ''Modern Times'' (Columbia), Mr. Dylan is obsessed with the mythic past, serving up a sleek, bluesy time warp that dips into Muddy Waters, Bing Crosby and the obscure 19th-century ''poet laureate of the Confederacy,'' Henry Timrod. Even when studying contemporary popular culture, he is reminded of his own back pages: ''I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying,'' he sings. ''When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line.'' At 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; sold out. (Ben Sisario)    BEN FOLDS (Tonight, Sunday and Monday) Though his most intriguing work since the demise of his band Ben Folds Five has been his direction two years ago on William Shatner's surprisingly strong album (really!) ''Has Been,'' in his solo work Mr. Folds has continued to skillfully and entertainingly walk a line between the snarky and the sincere. (His breathy piano-ballad version of a particularly vulgar Dr. Dre song crossed that line by miles.) Tonight at 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; sold out.

(Sisario)    GREY DOES MATTER (Tomorrow) Jason Crawford, the polymath who records as Grey Does Matter, used to take a reprogrammed Nintendo Gameboy along with him to help perform his spare, guitar-synthesizer songs of disconnection and boyish obsession. (''The wind gets in and burns the skin like a battleground super ninja.'') But now he has a full band and is celebrating the release of his new album, ''Your Job Will Kill You'' (Pop Rally!). At 8 p.m., Glasshouse Gallery, 289 Kent Avenue, at South First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $7. (Sisario)    HOLD STEADY, CONSTANTINES (Wednesday) Like a meeting of AC/DC and the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady -- from Brooklyn, but with Minneapolis origins -- plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock, while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I've heard about original sin,'' he sings. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' With the Constantines, a feedback-worshiping Canadian band. At 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $17. (Sisario)    JAGUARES (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Jaguares include former members of a leading Mexican rock band, Caifanes, and they add some alternative-rock touches to Caifanes's moody, dynamic songs.

(Pareles)    KID KOALA (Tonight) A superstar on the DJ circuit, Kid Koala, a k a Eric San, from Montreal, has the rare talent of imbuing scattered samples with humor and narrative, allowing him to capture the attention of audiences from clubs to stadiums. (He has opened for the Beastie Boys and Radiohead.) At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario)    * MODEST MOUSE (Tonight and tomorrow night) A band so emblematic of 21st-century indie rock that it was mentioned by name in the Supreme Court's decision on MGM v. Grokster last year, Modest Mouse links antsy, catchy guitar lines to vocals that are always just a few shrieks away from a destructive tantrum. These shows complete a five-concert New York series showing off songs from the band's long-delayed new album as well as its newest member, Johnny Marr, the innovative guitarist of the Smiths. With Marcellus Hall. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)    MUDHONEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) When Mudhoney released its first record, ''Touch Me I'm Sick,'' in 1988, the band did not look built to last. But it has persisted with its mixture of sneering blues and boozy, decelerated punk, the ingredients that gave birth to grunge. With Birds of Avalon and Hank IV tonight, and Dan Melchior and Hulda tomorrow. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $18 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sisario)    NEW RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE (Tomorrow) There might not have been deafening cries for a reunion of the New Riders of the Purple Sage, the colorless country-rock spinoff of the Grateful Dead. But here it is, with an original member, David Nelson, and Buddy Cage, who took the place of Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $35. (Sisario)    NEW YORK DOLLS (Wednesday) Never say die. With its two surviving original members well into their 50s, this proto-punk, proto-glam band, which made trashy cross-dressing a rock 'n' roll virtue, this summer released its first new album in 32 years, ''One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This'' (Roadrunner), and its appetite for sleazy vamps and hilarious wickedness is undiminished. ''You're designed so intelligent/ Ain't no way that was an accident,'' David Johansen sings in ''Dance Like a Monkey.'' ''Come on shake your monkey hips, my pretty little creationist.'' Presented by Little Steven's Underground Garage, with the Supersuckers, the Chesterfield Kings and the Charms.

(Sisario)    OK GO (Tomorrow) With all the focus on this Chicago band's dancing skills -- its ingenious treadmill skit was so popular online that MTV had the group perform it at the Video Music Awards this summer, despite the lack of a nomination -- not much attention has been paid to its jaunty, Cars-like and thoroughly adequate power-pop. So expect more dancing. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)    * PERE UBU, BUSH TETRAS (Wednesday) Punk rock had an unassimilable avant-garde right from the start: in the mid-70s, while bands like the Dead Boys and the Ramones were perfecting the narrow sonic attack that came to be known as punk, Pere Ubu, from Cleveland, was playing a dissonant, urgent and deeply idiosyncratic variation centered on the sung-spoken vocals of David Thomas. The Bush Tetras, of early 80s New York vintage, have a squirmy funk take on experimental rock. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario)    PLIMSOULS (Tonight) One of the sharpest bands of the early 80s power-pop scene, the Plimsouls, from Los Angeles, reached back to the Beatles, as well as Elvis Costello, and cemented its place in pop culture with an appearance in the 1983 film ''Valley Girl.'' The band, led by Peter Case, has good luck with reunions: when it got back together in the mid-90s, it made one of its best albums, ''Kool Trash.'' At 8, with Parallax Project, Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $15. (Sisario)    +44 (Tonight) It's not often that the rival former members of a multiplatinum band pass through town with their new groups, giving curious fans a controlled experiment to judge who has made out better. Last year the boys-will-be-boys pop-punk band Blink-182 went on acrimonious hiatus, and one of its two singers, Tom DeLonge, started a new group, Angels and Airwaves; it played the Bowery Ballroom in May. Now come the two other alumni, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, whose group, +44, plays Webster Hall tonight. Both bands are darker and more emo-influenced than Blink-182, but unfortunately for fans scrambling for a way into this show, neither has much of its fire. At 7, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)    ROBERT RANDOLPH AND THE FAMILY BAND (Tonight) Robert Randolph used to play gospel songs on his pedal steel guitar at the House of God Church in Orange, N.J. But he and his band have emerged into the secular realm of jam bands, which have embraced both his rip-roaring virtuosity and his gift for making his instrument sing without a word. With Rocco DeLuca and the Burden. At 7:30, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $30. (Pareles)    LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tomorrow) Las Rubias del Norte, long in residence at Barbès, a cozy bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, play boleros, cumbias and other Latin styles, elegantly arranged for a small band and two songbird sopranos. 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $8. (Sisario)    GILBERTO SANTA ROSA (Wednesday) This salsa singer, or sonero, has held on to the fundamentals of the music, with a voice like a trumpet and a flair for improvisation. Salsa is getting squeezed on one side by reggaetón and on the other by sappy Latin pop, but Mr. Santa Rosa has persevered; at this concert, he celebrates 30 years of hits. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $65 to $125. (Pareles)    REGINA SPEKTOR (Monday) Rhapsodic and sweet, Ms. Spektor's fantasies veer from the childlike to the erotic, in endearingly idiosyncratic piano and vocal parts that can resemble P J Harvey, Billie Holiday or Chopin. At 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; sold out. (Sisario)    TRALALA, ANTIETAM (Tonight) The bohemian Brooklyn version of a girl group, Tralala (formerly Tight Fit) features four women singing in animated if inexact harmony, and three men bashing away at the kind of nursery-rhyme-Ramones groove perfected by Shonen Knife. Antietam's slashing guitars, shambling beat and defiant vocals defined indie rock before that label became a vague cliché. (Tralala also opens for Robyn Hitchcock tomorrow.) At 9, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Sisario)    Steve Tyrell (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell belongs to a latter-day breed of rock singer who has belatedly embraced popular standards. The breed includes Rod Stewart (whose records Mr. Tyrell co-produces), Michael Bolton and Dr. John (for whom he sometimes sounds like vocal double). At 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight, tomorrow and Thursday night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $90 cover, dinner required. (Holden)    FRANKIE VALLI (Wednesday) Newly re-enshrined by ''Jersey Boys,'' a success on Broadway even as most other shows based on pop stars have failed -- does anyone remember ''Lennon''? -- Mr. Valli begins four nights of concerts at the Rose Theater, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center, joined as always by his Four Seasons. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $75 to $125. (Sisario)    * DOC WATSON (Tomorrow) One of the great repositories of American folk music, the guitarist and singer Doc Watson, from Deep Gap, N.C., plays bluegrass, country and blues in an elegant but understated style. He performs as part of a tribute to the Friends of Old Time Music, an organization that played an important role in the early 1960s folk revival in New York City by putting on concerts by rural musicians (it first presented Mr. Watson in 1962); that group is also commemorated on an outstanding new boxed set, ''Friends of Old Time Music: The Folk Revival 1961-1965'' (Smithsonian Folkways).

(Sisario)    WOLFMOTHER (Wednesday) The retro-rock wayback machine makes two stops in the music of this Australian band: to the screamy abandon of mid-1960s garage rock, and then forward just a few years to the amp-throbbing, proto-metal bacchanals of Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath. With Dead Meadow and Silversun Pickups. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $27 in advance, $30 at the door.

RASHIED ALI QUINTET (Tomorrow) Rashied Ali has had a substantial career in the jazz avant-garde over the past 40 years, beginning with his percussive role in the late-period work of John Coltrane.

At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com; $25.

(Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Monday) This breezy new production conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set -- a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through, thanks to subtle directing by Bartlett Sher. Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. Diana Damrau is a vocally brilliant and feisty Rosina. Juan Diego Flórez could not be more adorable as Count Almaviva, though his voice sounds pinched and shaky at times. Maurizio Benini conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) It's usually Mimi's show, but the tenors are a draw in this run: Rolando Villazón, the hot tenor of the moment, on the stage, and Plácido Domingo in the role of mentor, that is, conductor, in the pit. Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano who makes her company debut tomorrow, has already shown her credible Mimi across the plaza at the New York City Opera. Susannah Glanville and Peter Coleman-Wright are Musetta and Marcello; for some, Zeffirelli's production will always be the star. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 tickets remaining for tomorrow, $110 for Tuesday. (Anne Midgette)    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) Seville is tired in Jonathan Eaton's ''Carmen'': battered Venetian blinds and jagged Corinthian columns create a mellow air of decrepitude without saying anything particularly original. It's a serviceable enough production, winding up its run tomorrow. Vanessa Cariddi plays the Gypsy; Kerri Marcinko and Daesan No are Micaëla and Escamillo; Scott Piper, who has a promising voice he can sometimes use well, is Don José; and Gary Thor Wedow conducts. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Midgette)    'COSÌ FAN TUTTE' (Tonight) The City Opera's intelligently conceived and well-sung production of Mozart's masterpiece closes tonight. The cast is anchored by Julianna Di Giacomo and James Maddalena. Julius Rudel conducts. At 8, the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Bernard Holland)    'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Opera is big and loud, ''children's theater'' is light and fun, and Engelbert Humperdinck's classic represents an uneasy juxtaposition of the two. City Opera deserves kudos for a production that, by setting the action in 1890's New York, moves the story into a more adult or believable realm -- with Hansel and Gretel as immigrant children lapsing into German ditties in a singing English translation -- without losing some of the important elements, like the witch going into the oven at the end. The singers trade off between performances; Jennifer Aylmer and Jennifer Rivera are one pair of leads who do a fine job. They sing tomorrow; Julianne Borg and Jennifer Tiller sing on Sunday. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)    * 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) The Met inaugurated its season, and the tenure of the ambitious general manager Peter Gelb, with the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella's visually beautiful production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly.'' There is one more chance to see it. The abstract staging deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-sized puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly, and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. James Levine conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tonight and Wednesday) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. Vincenzo La Scola sings Cavaradossi tonight; Walter Fraccaro takes over on Wednesday. James Morris is a known and growly quantity as Scarpia. The real news is the company debut of Nicola Luisotti, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. Tonight at 8, Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 tickets remaining for tonight; $15 to $175 for Wednesday. (Midgette)    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leon Botstein and his orchestra continue their theme-based exploration of the repertory with ''Symphonic Mexico,'' a program that looks at three of Mexico's best-known composers. Silvestre Revueltas is represented by ''Redes'' (1943) and one of his most popular scores, ''La Noche de los Mayas'' (1939). From Carlos Chávez's catalog, Mr. Botstein leads the ''Sinfonía di Antigona'' (1933). And Anne-Akiko Myers will be the soloist in Manuel Ponce's Violin Concerto (1943).

The program's centerpiece is ''Il Festino,'' a comedy by Banchieri. Also included are instrumental and vocal works by Corradini, Vitali, Vecchi and Peri. At 8, Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 967-9157, artekearlymusic.org; $25 and $35; $25 and $15 for students and 65+.

(Kozinn)    * CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) Late in life, when he was already ill, Debussy began composing a group of six sonatas for diverse instruments. But he died after writing only three of them. The Chamber Music Society has had the creative idea to invite three composers -- Steven Stucky, Kaija Saariaho and Marc-André Dalbavie -- to write three sonatas to take the places of Debussy's intended works. These recent pieces will be performed along with Debussy's sonatas, which were his final works. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5778, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $58.

Museums    * Bronx Museum of the Arts, 'Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)    Brooklyn Museum: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are ''Dead Dad,'' a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and ''Man in a Boat,'' in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale in several pieces, like the tableau of the woman in bed, giant hand to apprehensive face. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    * Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,'  through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    * Frick Collection: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28.

The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Velázquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbáran and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger's famous title, the show might be called ''Ways of Seeing Paintings.'' (See above.) (Smith)    * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,'  through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck)    Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Americans in Paris: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7719, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    The Met: 'Coaxing the Spirits to Dance,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)    MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them François Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)    * Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * Moma: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith)    * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)    Galleries: Chelsea    ERNESTO NETO: 'FROM WHAT WE ARE MADE' Mr. Neto presents his version of the miracle of human conception with a luminous white tent the shape of a rainbow, with a thick foam floor, filled with a pile of small, colorful soft sculptures made in pantyhose fabric and stuffed with buckwheat shells. As the viewer enters the enclosed space, the floor shifts and subsides, tossing the sculptures about the tent and making it hard to stay upright. It is like traversing a marshmallow or wading through a pool of jelly, though with the phantasmagoria of a funhouse in which we can climb and play. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Nov. 25th. (Benjamin Genocchio)    Last Chance    * JENNIFER BORNSTEIN You are an anthropologist studying your own tribe without benefit of camera. What to do? Try etching. In her first New York exhibition since her 1998 debut, the neo-Conceptualist Jennifer Bornstein does exactly this, creating small, meticulous, slightly naïve etched portraits of her subjects, starting with her teenage roommate. Friends, colleagues and students are tenderly rendered, as are female performance artists from the 1970s; ideas for sculptures and installations, and, finally, Margaret Mead. The meditation on things anthropological turns in a sly yet genuine self-portrait. Gavin Brown's enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, South Village, (212) 627-5258; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * FERNANDO BOTERO: ABU GHRAIB It is moving to encounter these large, unnerving images and austere compositions on American soil. Based on images and written accounts that came to light at the time of the Iraq prison abuse scandal, they do something the harrowing photographs of the naked, blindfolded and tormented prisoners do not: they restore their dignity and humanity without diminishing their agony or the absolute injustice of their situation. Mr. Botero manages this as painters always have, through manipulations of scale, color and form and majestic isolation and by making surprisingly astute readjustments of his own daffy style. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    Anant Joshi Cities in Asia are changing fast. They're going up and coming down at about equal speed. Urban culture, flooded with global goods and media, is changing too. Inevitably, such transformations have a big impact on art, and they are the subjects of new work by Anant Joshi, who lives and works in Mumbai. Paintings show a vision of the city modeled on commercial packing materials. Small sculptures, monuments to consumerist chaos, are assembled from hundreds of miniature toys, all made in China. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    Lisa Yuskavage Featuring nearly 30 pieces, two shows star the dreamily rendered, improbably cantilevered women with whom Ms. Yuskavage has made her reputation. At first glance, these new works seem as dominated as ever by their subjects' cartoonish physical attributes: wistful, pneumatic nudes set in sumptuous, jewel-toned environments, their louche fecundity echoed in sexualized scatterings of globular fruit and bursting floral arrangements. Yet these paintings hold clues to the evolution of Ms. Yuskavage's program. Her transgressive tightrope act between feeding and interrogating the male gaze is more rewarding because she has endowed her characters not simply with dramatic curves, but also with an increasingly vivid inner life. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, and Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street; closes tomorrow.
