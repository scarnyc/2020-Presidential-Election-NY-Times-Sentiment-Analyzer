Aesop Rock is the most intriguing of all the rappers affiliated with the Brooklyn-based label Definitive Jux. His new album, ''Bazooka Tooth,'' is full of off-kilter beats and bilious rhymes that overlap so densely that you may sometimes think you are hearing two records at once. His logorrhea can be exhausting, but his quick tongue and enigmatic narratives may win you over, even if you can decipher only a few lines at a time. One riff seems to go something like this: ''Buried his nozzle in fossil marker art/Pardon, cadaver had a legitimate pulse, and littered volts/Over the village where the skittish pigeons molt.''
