2,Let the ballot battle begin.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/blogs/19thecaucus-minnesot7533.html,Let the ballot battle begin.,"Get used to it. From today through probably mid-December, the ballot-by-ballot progress of the statewide recount in Minnesota's bitter Senate race will provoke at least daily firing rounds (and boasts of leads, however minute) between the two campaigns.  As the manual recount started today, officials with the campaign of Senator Norm Coleman sought to reassure supporters that while the vote totals may ""swing wildly from day to day,"" they were confident the Republican lawmaker would hold onto his seat.  But Mr. Coleman's challenger, Al Franken, held his own on Wednesday. He traveled to Washington for meetings with Senate leaders, including Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, Charles E. Schumer of New York and the woman who may (or may not) be his future colleague, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.  According to a spokesman for the Franken campaign, the Democratic candidate gave the senators an update on the recount process and they briefed him on the party's legislative agenda. When he emerged from one of his meetings on Capitol Hill he reportedly said that he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his chances.  Although Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said that as of Wednesday morning the race started over ""at zero,"" in the final tally before the recount, Mr. Franken was trailing Mr. Coleman by 215 votes.   The slim margin has the Franken campaign looking for every last vote. A judge's ruling on Wednesday compelled one Minnesota county to turn over information on absentee voters whose ballots were rejected. The Franken team is trying to obtain similar data from each of the state's 87 counties, looking for evidence of any irregularities.  The Franken campaign also has a related request, pending with the state canvassing board, for a review of rejected absentee ballots.   Thousands of volunteer representatives from both campaigns fanned out across the state to observe the process and challenge ballots that may have been miscounted. The secretary of state's office plans to post regular updates of the recount results as precincts complete the painstaking process of counting each of the nearly 3 million votes by hand.  The Coleman campaign turned its Web site into a real-time ticker of recount developments, and both candidates are raising money to keep their campaigns afloat until a winner is declared.  Elections officials have set a goal of Dec. 5 to complete the counting, and the state canvassing board plans to reconvene on Dec. 16 to review all the challenged ballots.
