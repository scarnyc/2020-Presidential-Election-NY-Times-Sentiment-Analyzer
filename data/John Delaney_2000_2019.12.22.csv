0," A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.    * AARKTICA, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. In the opening song of Aarktica's new album, ''Pure Tone Audiometry'' (Silber), Jon DeRosa wonders, ''Am I out to sea, farther than I need to be?/To find my way home, I don't know.'' Aarktica's songs are extended reveries, built on loops of guitars and drums and occasional voices. The musical elements hover and circle, float by or bristle with distortion as the songs drift through serenity and trouble. Sunday night, with Echo at 7, the Mobius Band at 8, Aarktica at 9 and Healamonster and Tarier at 10; admission is $8 (Jon Pareles).",https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-217700.html,,A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.,E,29,The New York Times,[],[],2003-02-07T05:00:00+0000,article,"Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk",Movies,Schedule,nyt://article/7f922cac-c7df-59a6-b1ac-a4272d699cb1,3398,nyt://article/7f922cac-c7df-59a6-b1ac-a4272d699cb1,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,,,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,,,,,[],,

2," A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.    * ANTIBALAS, SUGARMAN 3, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Antibalas gives a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afro-beat, a Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger, by updating both the funk and the political messages. Regular local appearances keep tightening the band, and it's a show just watching more than a dozen musicians cram themselves onto a club stage and still find room to dance. Sugarman 3 sets out to recreate 1960's and 70's funk.

3,"HUDSON-Edward Joseph, 98, born on March 13, 1904, died on January 23, 2003. A long-time resident of Houston, Ed Hudson was born to Marion Dooley Hudson and Wilbur E. Hudson in Newark, New Jersey, the youngest child and only son in a family of five children. In 1926 Mr. Hudson graduated cum laude from Stevens Institute of Technology from which he held Mechanical Engineering and Doctor of Engineering degrees. He founded Hudson Engineering Corporation in Houston in 1933 and operated the company along with Hudson Products Corporation until its merger with J. Ray McDermott and Co., Inc. in 1969. Mr. Hudson continued as Chairman of the Board of McDermott for five years until his retirement in 1974. Between 1940 and 1969, Mr. Hudson organized and headed various corporations primarily to construct, own and operate gas processing plants and pipelines. These included Distillate Production Corporation, Acadia Corporation, Egan Oil Purchasing Company, Carthage Corporation, and Port Processing Corporation, all of which were merged into Hudson Gas and Oil Corporation, and sold to Continental Oil Company in 1963. Mr. Hudson served on the boards of McDermott, TransOcean Oil Corporation, Gulf Resources & Chemical Corporation, and Texas Commerce Bank. Mr. Hudson also developed and operated the Hudson Cattle Company on the Broken Triangle Ranch near Bay City, Texas, where he bred registered American Brahman cattle. While involved in ranching, Mr. Hudson also established a stable of thoroughbreds, and in conjunction with Lane's End Farm, he enjoyed breeding and racing horses in Kentucky. While successful in business, Mr. Hudson pursued many other interests. New York was among his favorite cities. During the late 1940's to 1970, Ed Hudson was a generous contributor to the New York City Ballet. He was among the early and avid supporters of George Balanchine and Barbara Horgan. He served as a trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and he was an active participant in building the Republican Party in Texas. He spent many years flying his own Beechcraft airplanes. He enjoyed backgammon and baseball, and he loved birds, gardens and flowers, particularly orchids. Through his life, he was blessed with remarkable good health and energy, and until age 98 he continued to visit his office each day where he managed his post-retirement interests. Ed Hudson's commitment to learning never wavered; he was an enthusiastic and generous contributor to education. Along with supporting Stevens Institute, he and his wife founded the Edward J. and Josephine G. Hudson Endowed Scholarship Fund at Baylor College of Medicine. To date the Hudson Scholarship fund has sponsored the training of more than 24 physician scientists through graduate and medical school. He also supported numerous other charitable organizations. Mr. Hudson is survived by his beloved wife, Josephine Gill Hudson, his two sons, Edward Joseph Hudson, Jr. and his wife, Lynne, of Houston, and Robert Lee Hudson and his wife, Becky, of Napa, California, five grandchildren, Sarah Hudson of New York, Wilhelmina Hudson of Houston, Edward Joseph Hudson II, Claire Hudson, and William Campbell Hudson of Napa. He is also survived by his three stepsons, Christopher Gill, Peter Gill and Richardson Gill, and their families, all of San Antonio, by Stacy, Wade and Colin Head of Houston, and by his nephew, Edward Joseph Toohey, and his wife, Phyllis, of South Hampton, New York. Mr. Hudson is mourned and will be missed greatly by his staff at home, Michael Lance and Victoria Loehr, and by his office staff, Cynthia Hughes, Mary Harris, Janette Burch, Lynn Einkauf and their familiies. The Hudsons wish to thank Dr. Michael DeBakey, Dr. George Noon, Dr. Mohammed Attar, Dr. John McCarthy, Dr. Peter Jones and the exceptional nursing staff of the CICU at Methodist Hospital for their dedication and loving care. A memorial service will be held for Mr. Hudson at St. Martin's Episcopal Church, 717 Sage Road, Houston, Texas on Monday, January 27 at 2 P.M. The Reverend Doctor Laurence A. Gipson will officiate. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Edward J. & Josephine G.

Because of a state mandate that has introduced higher standards on all grade levels, however, teachers are now emphasizing the analysis of documents, pictures and artifacts over textbooks and memorization. The approach uses what are known as document-based questions, or D.B.Q.'s, to stimulate thought. While some teachers have always used eyewitness accounts to conjure the sights, smells and sounds of past events, D.B.Q.'s now show up on tests that are mandatory for public school students, including the 10th and 11th grade social studies Regents exams required for graduation.",WC,14,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Education and Schools', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'History', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Tests and Testing', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Museums', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}]",2003-01-12T05:00:00+0000,article,Westchester Weekly Desk,New York,News,nyt://article/452372c8-6398-5924-8a63-11c749ccc4c6,1174,nyt://article/452372c8-6398-5924-8a63-11c749ccc4c6,"At Local Museums, a Chance for Students to Touch the Past",EDUCATION,,"EDUCATION; At Local Museums, a Chance for Students to Touch the Past",,,,By Marc Ferris,"[{'firstname': 'Marc', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Ferris', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,
