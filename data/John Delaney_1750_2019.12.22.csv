Now the owners have made an exclusive deal with Webster Hall, the 1,400-capacity dance club on East 11th Street in the East Village once known as the Ritz, to present even larger concerts there. The shows will be advertised as ''The Bowery Presents,'' and a new sound system will be installed, said John Moore, who books the Bowery. Webster Hall will be available for bookings seven nights a week, he said, although its late-night dancing on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays means that any other concerts will have to end by 11:30 p.m., resulting in strange meetings of rock and dance fans on their way in and out, already a common occurrence there.
