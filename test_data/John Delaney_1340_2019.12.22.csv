1,"Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.    Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton (''Everybody Loves Raymond'') star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    'TRANSLATIONS' Previews start on Thursday; opens on Jan. 25. Brian Friel's drama about a British officer in 19th-century rural Ireland deals with themes of language, imperialism and culture clash. Garry Hynes directs (1:55). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'BECOMING ADELE' Eric Houston's one-woman show about a young Brooklyn waitress's journey to self-actualization imagines a New York where fairy tales are possible even for the very ordinary. The sentiment is heavy and thick, but Kimberly Stern's performance burrows through it to deliver moving moments (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante)    'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)    'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger)    'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'TWO TRAINS RUNNING'  Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Buggé's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful ''Copenhagen''-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 362-0329. (Gates)    'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30); closing tomorrow. The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Gates)    'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'CIRCUS OZ' Welcome holiday entertainment (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Van Gelder)    'A CRAZY SOUND' The Italian avant-gardist Dario D'Ambrosi offers a jaunty, unexpectedly feel-good musical about the mentally ill (1:15). La MaMa's Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included.) It's bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Tuesday. (Isherwood)    'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    * 'KAOS'  Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (John Rockwell)    'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000; closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    ' 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE' Five prominent writers -- Christopher Durang, Mac Wellman, Elizabeth Swados, Roger Rosenblatt and Len Jenkin -- toss off short plays inspired by this Christmas poem, and the Flea Theater's troupe of young actors attack them with verve. The Swados piece, ''Holiday Movies,'' is as wacky as they come (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)    'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future in which the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)    'BLACK CHRISTMAS' (R, 100 minutes) It's been more than 30 years since the original ''Black Christmas'' revealed how much fun it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Glen Morgan's disastrous remake not only sidelines the original's hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Smothering terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, the movie is no more than a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. (Catsoulis)    'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)    'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)    'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)    'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)    * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)    'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis)    'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)    'DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' (No rating, 93 minutes) This fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, imagines what might happen if George W. Bush were assassinated. Condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by Gabriel Range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. Its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (Scott)    'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)    'DÉJÀ VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)    'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)    * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic exposé of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)    * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)    * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 2:12 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)    'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Stephen Holden)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)    'THE GOOD SHEPHERD' (R, 157 minutes) This chilly film about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. The story more or less begins and ends at the Bay of Pigs. Although the film seems true in broad outline and scrupulous detail, there is something ungraspable and unknowable about this world, even if it is also one we ourselves have helped create. (Dargis)    'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)    'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)    'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)    * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)    'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)    * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly titled documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's ''Drawing Restraint 9,'' a love story in which he and his partner, Björk, dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis)    'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)    'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) This season's answer to ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' it's an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy. (Holden)    'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)    'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)    'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)    'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)    'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    Film Series    THE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tonight through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Jacques Rivette, the innovative French New Wave director, concludes this weekend with two features. Mr. Rivette's most recent film, ''The Story of Marie and Julien'' (2003), a romantic mystery starring Emmanuelle Béart, plays tonight. ''Va Savoir'' (2001), a romantic farce about Pirandello, jewel theft and six people in love, will be screened tomorrow and Sunday. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Anita Gates)    ESSENTIALLY WOODY (Tonight through Thursday) Film Forum's 28-film retrospective of Woody Allen's work continues this weekend with two double features. ''Broadway Danny Rose'' (1984), about small-time show business, and ''Radio Days'' (1987), an exercise in family nostalgia, play today and tomorrow. ''Sleeper'' (1973) and ''Bananas'' (1971), two of Mr. Allen's funniest, are the features on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. (Through Jan. 11.) 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $10.50 (Gates)    PRIX JEAN VIGO (Today and tomorrow) Since February, the Museum of Modern Art has been honoring Jean Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with screenings of films that have won the prize that bears his name. The series winds up today and tomorrow with three features. Arnaud Desplechin's drama ''La Vie des Morts'' (1991), about a family's reaction to a suicide attempt, will be shown with Laurent Cantet's short about high school students, ''Tous à la Manif'' (1994). ''Maine-Océan'' (1986) is Jacques Rozier's comedy about train passengers. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)    VIVA PEDRO! RETURNS (Today through Wednesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting eight Pedro Almodóvar films over the holidays. This weekend's features include ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' (1988), Mr. Almodóvar's raucous portrait of the rejected and the high-strung; ''The Flower of My Secret'' (1995), about a romance novelist with creative and personal problems; and ''All About My Mother'' (1999), in which Penélope Cruz plays a pregnant nun. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $10 (but $20 buys a pass to all eight movies). (Gates)    FRANZ WAXMAN: MUSIC FOR THE CINEMA (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Waxman (1906-1967), the German composer, with a 21-film retrospective. This weekend's films include ''Sayonara'' (1957), which employed a mix of American and Asian musical styles; ''Rebecca'' (1940), Hitchcock's haunting translation of the du Maurier romance; and ''Old Acquaintance'' (1943), starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins as longtime friends and rivals. (Through Jan. 17.) Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    A-BONES, SWINGIN' NECKBREAKERS (Sunday) Meaty, beaty, big and retro: the brawny sounds of gourmet 1960s-style garage-rock. The A-Bones' take on this sound is brusque and raw, while the Swingin' Neckbreakers play a more controlled version that recalls the Flamin' Groovies, the 1970s band that was perhaps the first (and best) in a long line of '60s garage revivalists. At 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $15. (Ben Sisario)    SANDRA BERNHARD (Tonight through Sunday) Expect outrageous comedy, but also expect some oddly dull music from Sandra Bernhard, like her colorless recent holiday song, ''Miracle of Lights,'' or her cover of the late-period Cheap Trick song ''The Flame,'' which is thankfully tucked into a hilarious routine about rescuing her daughter from a bad boyfriend. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 and 9:30, Sunday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $45 tonight and tomorrow; $100 Sunday at 7:30, $150 at 10:30. (Sisario)    BLACK LIPS (Tonight and Sunday) Sounding like a nightmarish variant of the 13th Floor Elevators or the Troggs, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, play a grisly version of 1960s garage-rock that is deliberately damaged. Tonight at 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. Sunday at 9 p.m., at Silent Barn, 915 Wyckoff Avenue, at Hancock Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com. (Sisario)    BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tonight and Sunday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place for long. Tonight at 9, with Kudu and DJ Hardedge, and Sunday at 9:30 p.m., at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30 tonight; for Sunday, $55 in advance or $60 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    ELECTRIC SIX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Electric Six looks fondly back to the early 1980s merger of rock guitars, disco beats and electro blips, with arch and gleefully overblown songs about dancing and romance, like ''Danger! High Voltage'' and ''Nuclear War'' (''on the dance floor''). With the Dansettes on Sunday. At 10 both nights, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15 tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. (Pareles)    * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight through Sunday) The strongest incarnation so far of this singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11, Sunday night at 9, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum tonight and tomorrow night, $650 on Sunday. (Stephen Holden)    RACHELLE GARNIEZ (Thursday) Ms. Garniez is a songwriter who plays accordion, which leads her to wrap her playful songs and hyperactive voice in country tunes, waltzes or wheezy ballads. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $8. (Pareles)    GLASSJAW (Tonight) This tough-as-nails Long Island band was a big player in the dissonant, tantrum-prone punk subgenre sometimes called screamo or post-hardcore, which peaked in the early years of this decade. A revolving door of lineup changes kept the band from moving forward, but Glassjaw is now reportedly working on a new album. At 6:30, with This Is Hell and Crime in Stereo, at Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)    GOV'T MULE (Tonight through Sunday) Led by the Allman Brothers guitarist Warren Haynes, this Southern-rock-meets-Led Zeppelin jam band plays three shows for New Year's weekend, with notable guests each night. Tonight is Los Lobos, the enduring Latino rock band from Los Angeles; tomorrow is the North Mississippi Allstars, whose blues-rock wanders into jam territory; and Sunday features Toots Hibbert, the Jamaican singer who, with his band the Maytals, helped shape reggae from the very beginning. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 9 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $40.50 to $63.50 tonight and tomorrow night; $55 to $79.50 on Sunday. (Sisario)    * 'HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL: THE CONCERT' (Tonight and Sunday) Cynical parents might compare it to the Monkees. But what in the world could be wrong with ''I'm a Believer''? Or, for that matter, with ''Breaking Free,'' the PG-rated climax from ''High School Musical,'' the Disney Channel phenomenon whose soundtrack is the best-selling album of the year? Performing the songs from this tween ''Grease,'' to the accompaniment of many thousands of squeals, will be the cast of the movie, or at least most of it: Zac Efron, who played the heartthrob, Troy, is replaced here by Drew Seeley, who supplied many of Troy's vocals on the soundtrack. Tonight at 7, Sunday afternoon at 3, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; sold out tonight, $35.50 to $55.50 on Sunday. (Sisario)    * JENNIFER HUDSON (Tomorrow) This former ''American Idol'' finalist and star of ''Dreamgirls'' performs songs from that movie in a one-off concert choreographed by Hinton Battle, who also appears in the film. And if that's not enough ''Dreamgirls'' for you, the concert will be followed by remixes of music from the movie by the celebrity DJ Junior Vasquez. At 10 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, saintatlarge.com; $90 in advance, $100 at the door. (Sisario)    JAMES HUNTER (Tomorrow) After years honing his style in London pubs, this dapper British singer has emerged with ''People Gonna Talk'' (Go/Rounder), recreating with care and affection the smooth, slithery R&B of early-1960s American singers like Sam Cooke and Little Willie John. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $29 at the door. (Sisario)    JAPANTHER (Thursday) This Brooklyn avant-rock duo has bridged the gap between scruffy noise-punk and contemporary art: for the latest Whitney Biennial, the band collaborated with Dan Graham, Rodney Graham, Laurent P. Berger and Tony Oursler on a live puppet opera called ''Don't Trust Anyone Over 30.'' But perhaps even more impressive, Japanther has also provided musical accompaniment for a synchronized-swimming performance. Anyone who has witnessed synchronized swimming knows that can't be easy. At 8 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $8. (Sisario)    MOE (Tomorrow and Sunday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacy interludes or the borderline of funk. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. Sunday at 9 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $52.50. (Pareles)    REBIRTH BRASS BAND (Tomorrow) A New Orleans institution since the 1980s, the Rebirth Brass Band updates the traditional strutting rhythms and continuous improvisation of New Orleans parades with an infusion of funk. It doesn't need microphones, amplifiers or anything but breath and rhythm to make a crowd jump. At 11:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles)    VERNON REID (Tonight) Long after his time as the lead guitarist of Living Colour, Mr. Reid continues to play in ways so weirdly innovative that he sometimes seems more magician than mere musician. Tonight he offers ''A Night of Pure Guitar'' with Rob Balducci and Dave Weiner. At 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $15. (Sisario)    THE SLIP (Sunday) New Year's Eve was made for jam bands, which are used to playing all night without exhausting themselves (or their audiences). The Slip, from Boston, plays a mild jazz fusion that veers into the abstract post-rock of Tortoise. With Meowskers. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $25. (Sisario)    * PATTI SMITH (Tonight through Sunday) For the ninth year, Ms. Smith and her band ring in the new year with noise, poetry and rock 'n' roll. This event features a special milestone: tomorrow is Ms. Smith's 60th birthday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)    * SPOON (Tomorrow) Led by Britt Daniel, one of the best songwriters ever to get stuck with the meaningless appellation ''indie,'' Spoon, from Austin, Tex., accomplishes a lot with a little. Its tight, jabby songs, influenced equally by minimalist post-punk and sentimental white soul, are beguiling miniatures that seem to end just when you think you've figured them out. As a result, you must listen again and again and again. With Benjy Ferree, a rising singer-songwriter from Washington. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)    THE SWORD (Tomorrow) Long live Black Sabbath. Or, at least, bands that sound an awful lot like them, such as the Sword, an Austin, Tex., group that seems to have most of what made Black Sabbath great. Fuzzy, decelerated blues-rock riffs? Check. Sasquatch tempo? Check. Songs about vague industrial-age catastrophes and medieval monsters? Check (''The Horned Goddess,'' ''Iron Swan''). Ozzy Osbourne? Well, no, even retro-rock has its limits. At 9 p.m., with Stinking Lizaveta and Motherboar, at Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)    UNCLE MONK (Wednesday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this acoustic duo, singing tautly written numbers -- kind of like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. With Radio I-Ching and Who Put the Bad Mouth On Me? At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)    * THE VIEW (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Arctic Monkeys are so 2006. The next next wave of hyperactive British rock savants is the View, four teenagers from Dundee, Scotland, who play sharp, tuneful pop-punk that resembles that of  the Arctic Monkeys. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., with the Diggs and Favourite Sons, at the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario)    WHITE MAGIC (Thursday) Mira Billotte's songs in White Magic are both spartan and spooky, with simple piano figures underlying vocals that can be steady incantations or elaborate, multilayered rhapsodies. With Women and Children, and Legends. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ABERCROMBIE, BYRON, GOMEZ AND WHITE (Thursday) The guitarist John Abercrombie, the clarinetist and tenor saxophonist Don Byron, the bassist Eddie Gomez and the drummer Lenny White make up this all-star collective, which seems predisposed to lean toward the funky side. (Through Jan. 7.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)    BALLIN' THE JACK (Thursday) This midsize ensemble, led by the clarinetist and saxophonist Matt Darriau, customarily spikes a swing-era repertory with madcap irreverence. That's certainly true of this engagement, featuring music from Marx Brothers film soundtracks, complete with Grouchoesque vocals from the alto saxophonist Roy Nathanson. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    DAVID BERGER AND THE SULTANS OF SWING (Tuesday) The music of Duke Ellington figures prominently in this weekly residency by the Sultans of Swing, a big band led by the knowledgeable David Berger.

(Chinen)    PETER BERNSTEIN, LARRY GOLDINGS, BILL STEWART (Tuesday through Thursday) A Hammond B-3 organ trio with a decidedly modern harmonic language and an intense collective bond; the crisp guitar of Mr. Bernstein meets the polyrhythmic churn of Mr. Goldings on organ, and Mr. Stewart on drums.

(Chinen)    ALEX BLAKE TRIO (Sunday) The intensely rhythmic style of the bassist Alex Blake has worked well in African-inspired jazz settings, notably the Randy Weston Trio. Here he features his own compositions in a group with Ted Cruz on keyboards and Jaime Affoumado on drums. At 10 and 11:30 p.m. and 12:45 a.m., Puppets Jazz Bar, 294 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, (718) 499-2627, puppetsjazz.com; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    CHRIS BOTTI (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Botti's brooding trumpet style has won him a sizable audience, as has his standard-laden repertory. He gets a shade more abstract with his first-rate working band; on New Year's Eve, it will follow an opening set by the vocalist and pianist Jon Regen. At 8 and 10:30 tonight and tomorrow night, at 7 and 10 on Sunday night, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $60 at tables, $40 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen)    PAQUITO D'RIVERA AND THE PANAMERICAN JAZZ ENSEMBLE (Tonight through Sunday) Few musicians have a better claim to pan-Americana than Paquito D'Rivera, the clarinetist and saxophonist who toured extensively with Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra. This engagement, at the club that bears Gillespie's name, will feature his more Latin-flavored tunes. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. Sold out on New Year's Eve.

(Chinen)    VINNY GOLIA, NELS CLINE, KEN FILIANO (Tonight) Mr. Golia, a multireedist, and Mr. Cline, a guitarist, are pillars of the West Coast free-improvising scene; they have a good conversational rapport, as they demonstrated a couple years ago on an album called ''The Entire Time'' (Nine Winds). Here they team up with Mr. Filiano, a stalwart bassist who has a home base in Brooklyn. At 8 and 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $15. (Chinen)    LOUIS HAYES'S CANNONBALL ADDERLEY LEGACY BAND (Tonight through Sunday) Julian (Cannonball) Adderley was an alto saxophonist who balanced bebop's harmonic precision with homegrown grit and soul. This crisp tribute band, led by his former drummer Louis Hayes, features the worthy alto saxophonist Vincent Herring and the sharp trumpeter Jeremy Pelt.

(Chinen)    MAP (Wednesday) The guitarist Mary Halvorson, the bassist Reuben Radding and the drummer Tatsuya Nakatani make up this texture-minded ensemble, which put out a likable album (with a different bassist) a few years ago. Their abstract interplay is best experienced in person, and in real time. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    * DELFEAYO MARSALIS TRIBUTE TO ELVIN JONES (Tuesday through Thursday) A few months ago the trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis released ''Minions Dominion'' (Troubadour Jass), an album recorded in 2003 and featuring the unmistakable polyrhythmic pulse of the drummer Elvin Jones. Here Mr. Marsalis pays tribute to Mr. Jones, who died in 2004, with a band featuring his brother Jason Marsalis on drums and either Mark Shim (on Tuesday and Wednesday) or David Liebman (on Thursday) on tenor saxophone. (Through Jan. 7.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    * SAL MOSCA (Monday) Mr. Mosca has largely based his piano style -- and, to a considerable extent, his career -- on the heady legacy of the pianist-composer Lennie Tristano. But at 79, he assuredly has an improvisational voice of his own; he also has a cult following, chiefly among his former students. He performs infrequently, but that's only one reason that this trio engagement is a noteworthy event. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $125. (Chinen)    REUBEN RADDING 40th BIRTHDAY CONCERT (Tonight) Reuben Radding, an adventurous bassist and composer, celebrates a special occasion with a passel of improvising friends, including the multireedists Daniel Carter and Ned Rothenberg, the guitarists Elliott Sharp and Mary Halvorson, and the drummer Andrew Drury.

(Chinen)    JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. She performs here with two frequent foils: the guitarist Adam Levy and the clarinetist Doug Weiselman. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    DIANE SCHUUR WITH THE CARIBBEAN JAZZ PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday) As on a recent album called ''Schuur Fire'' (Concord Picante), the singer Diane Schuur enjoys streamlined accompaniment from the vibraphonist Dave Samuels and his Caribbean Jazz Project. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 10:30, and Sunday night at 8 and 11, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $45 tonight and tomorrow night, with a $10 minimum; $110 and $160 on Sunday, including dinner. (Chinen)    TYSHAWN SOREY'S OBLIQUE / PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tuesday) Two ambitious ensembles that combine spacious avant-gardism with the melodic punch of rock. Oblique is a sextet led by Mr. Sorey, a ferocious drummer, with ranks including Mr. Robbins on alto saxophone and clarinet. Centric, led by Mr. Robbins, also happens to include Mr. Sorey, along with other bright young players, like the trumpeter Jesse Neuman and the keyboardist Eliot Cardinaux. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 614-0505, bowerypoetry.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    STEVE TURRE QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Steve Turre, the trombonist and conch shell player, brings both virtuosity and restraint to the conventions of small-group hard bop; his group includes his wife, the cellist and vocalist Akua Dixon, as well as the pianist Ronnie Mathews, the bassist Gerald Cannon and the drummer Dion Parson. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Chinen)    BOBBY WATSON AND HORIZON (Tuesday through Thursday) The alto saxophonist Bobby Watson formed his first version of Horizon more than 20 years ago, managing to iron a sharp new crease into the legacy of Jazz Messengers-inspired hard bop. His current iteration of the group, as heard on the 2004 album ''Horizon Reassembled'' (Palmetto), consists of Terell Stafford on trumpet, Edward Simon on piano, Essiet Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. (Through Jan. 7.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    * JOHN ZORN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Noise is the currency at a John Zorn improv party, which can feature any number of open-minded participants; tomorrow's cast will include the violinist Mark Feldman, the cellist Okkyung Lee, the pianist Sylvie Courvoisier and the drummer Matt Wilson. Then, on New Year's Eve, Mr. Zorn plays an early set at Tonic with the bassist and producer Bill Laswell and the drummer Guy Licata, among others. Tomorrow at 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $20. Sunday at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $30. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tonight and Tuesday night) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread public interest in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score for ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' have resulted in a sold-out run for ''The First Emperor.'' Alas, though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. But his music seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Plácido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)    'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tonight through Sunday night) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. Now offered is Strauss's merry ''Fledermaus,'' with a rotating cast. The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. At 7:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+, $125 for the New Year's Eve gala. (Vivien Schweitzer)    'THE MAGIC FLUTE' (Today through Tuesday, and Thursday) Julie Taymor's whimsical, puppet-filled production has gone even more child-friendly, abridged by the director into a 100-minute version with a new English text by J. D. McClatchy. But the Met hasn't skimped on the casts. Today Matthew Polenzani sings Tamino, and Nathan Gunn is a lively, entertaining Papageno; they will be joined tomorrow by the fantastic German bass René Pape as Sarastro. James Levine conducts today through Sunday, and Jens Georg Bachmann conducts on Tuesday and Thursday. Today, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m.; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. A live high-definition telecast will be shown tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-3809, filmlinc.com; $18; $15 for children. (Schweitzer)    'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Monday and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. James Levine conducts a cast that also includes René Pape as Sarastro, Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno and Cornelia Götz as Queen of the Night. On Thursday Scott Bergeson conducts, and Lisa Milne is Pamina. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 to $375 tickets remain for Monday, and $15 to $175 for Thursday. (Schweitzer)    Classical Music    AMOR ARTIS (Sunday) Johannes Somary and his fine chamber orchestra and choir have made their New Year's Eve Bach concert a tradition over the past two decades. This performance, the 22nd installment, includes three Cantatas -- Nos. 137, 191 and 200 -- as well as the ''Brandenburg'' Concertos Nos. 3 and 5. At 9 p.m., St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 874-4513, amorartis.org; $40. (Allan Kozinn)    ARTEK (Tomorrow) This period-instrument group offers one of the last celebrations of the waning Mozart year, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth. Enrico Gatti, an Italian violinist, leads the orchestra in ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,'' ''Serenata Notturno'' and arias from ''Don Giovanni,'' ''Il Re Pastore,'' ''La Clemenza di Tito'' and others, with Jessica Tranzillo, a soprano; Barbara Hollinshead, a mezzo-soprano; Drew Minter, a countertenor; and Philip Anderson, a tenor. The pianists Gwendolyn Toth, Artek's director, and Dongsok Shin, her husband, perform Mozart's Concerto for two fortepianos (K. 365). At 8 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248, artekearlymusic.org; $35 and $20; $10 off for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Thursday) Zubin Mehta returns to the Philharmonic next week. The opening work will be Beethoven's Violin Concerto, with Mr. Mehta's old friend the violinist Pinchas Zukerman as soloist, followed after intermission by Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' Mr. Mehta's tenure as music director of the Philharmonic has its defenders and detractors. But this Stravinsky score was a specialty of his back then. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; sold out. (Tommasini)    VASSILY PRIMAKOV AND KONSTANTIN SOUKHOVETSKI (Sunday) These two young pianists from the former Soviet Union, both in their 20s, play an interesting program of Beethoven, Czerny, John Corigliano and Tchaikovsky. Arium offers a little food and drink, and visual art as well. At 4 p.m., Arium Center for the Arts, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; sold out. (Bernard Holland)    'THE VERY LEAST OF P. D. Q. BACH' (Tuesday) Skewering the traditions of the classical music world is one thing; finding the comedic opportunities inherent in the music itself is another, and that is Peter Schickele's art. His canvas is the life and work of P. D. Q. Bach, the fictional ''last and least'' of J. S. Bach's progeny. With Mr. Schickele as guide and commentator, Xian Zhang will lead the New York Philharmonic in a program that includes the ''Desecration of the House'' Overture, the ''1712'' Overture, ''Eine Kleine Kiddiemusik,'' the Prelude to ''Einstein on the Fritz'' and a venerable P. D. Q. classic, the ''Pervertimento'' for bagpipes, bicycle, balloons and strings. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $30 to $90. (Kozinn)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) The last three days of this vibrant company's annual City Center season, ending with a special New Year's Eve performance. Tonight at 8, tomorrow row at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, alvinailey.org or nycitycenter.org; $25 to $150. (John Rockwell)    Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Lots of men can wear tutus; point shoes are another matter. If you want to see how real men pirouette, check out the Trocks, as they are called, performing classics like ''Swan Lake'' and creepy 20th-century ballets like ''The Cage.'' (Through Jan. 7.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Claudia La Rocco)    KWANZAA CELEBRATION: REGENERATION NIGHT (Tonight) Forces of Nature Dance Theater, a troupe dedicated to expressing balance, healing and harmony through movement, collaborates with Spirit Ensemble and Vy Higginsen's Gospel for Teens in a Kwanzaa event with Hazelle Goodman as host. At 7:30, the Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $12; $10 for groups. (Jack Anderson)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow) The final three performances of the 2006 installment of George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker.'' It may have been hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to mention the orchestra and stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Tigers of Wrath: Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio)    Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)    * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)    * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)    Queens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as of Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The show tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video ''Everyday,'' which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)    Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)    Galleries: Chelsea    * ATELIER VAN LIESHOUT: SLAVECITY In this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose ''participants'' each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. The tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the ''Midi Disciplinator,'' a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, through Jan. 6. (Smith)    * Noah Fischer, 'Rhetoric Machine' This young, Brooklyn-based artist has a winner of a first New York solo: a two-room, Rube-Goldbergesque kinetic environment set to a score of clips from doom-threatening speeches by United States presidents, ardent pop love songs and the baseline sound of jets and bombs. In sync with the soundtrack, low-tech, handmade light-projecting machines whir and jerk into life, turning the show into a combination of modernist ballet mécanique and gothic danse macabre. Technically ingenious and full of ideas, the show takes approximately 10 minutes to complete one sound-and-motion cycle. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)    * CANDIDA HOFER In large color photographs of the different galleries of the Louvre, taken on Tuesdays when the museum is closed, both the long, vaulted spaces and the painting and sculpture they contain speak of different times and styles. Equally effecting, if not a little frightening, is the lavish, timeless grandeur of these vistas. A palace that became a museum, the Louvre is also a precursor of the barrel-vaulted arcades that sprang up in Paris in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them are gone, but the Louvre's arcades live on. Sort of. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018. (Smith)    * CHEYNEY THOMPSON: 'QUELQUES ASPECTS DE L'ART BOURGEOIS: LA NON-INTERVENTION' A teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery's storage shelves. The title translates as ''Certain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Non-Intervention.'' Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, through Jan. 6. (Smith)    * 'When the Revolution Comes' The artist Michael St. John has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. It's great to revisit Nancy Grossman's leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and Holt Quentel's distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. Strong young artists like Nate Lowman, Joshua Weintraub and Josh White sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures -- Jamal Cyrus, A. J. Bocchino, Alex McQuilkan and Ellwyn Palmerton -- look good. Also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by Josedgardo Granados that bring pre-Columbian and post-Columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts, 508 West 26th Street, Suite 5A, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    * 'November'  The Los Angeles- based curator Jeffrey Uslip put together this obliquely topical group show, which includes several young West Coast-based artists. In a Babel-ish moment in art, language, scrambled and obscured, is one of the themes here, with Kara Tanaka's listening-booth sculpture transmuting past conversations into a melancholic music. Landscape as poisoned terrain is another. Surrealism, art's 21st-century Esperanto, is the prevailing language. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson, South Village, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)    Last Chance    * 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with the Pratt Institute in New York City, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age to the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794), by Gilbert Stuart, is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com; closes today. (Glueck)    * Asia Society: 'Gilded Splendor: Treasures of China's Liao Empire (907-1125)' The first major display of Liao objects outside China, this show gives the lie to the idea of the Khitan as cultural nobodies. Among the more exotic exhibits are those that reveal Khitan burial customs for royal personages: the corpse was first embalmed and then carefully wrapped in silk, and the adornments included a whole-body netting, a metal mask of gold or lesser material, a burial suit and an overcoat. The Khitan taste for jewelry, too, is evident in the elaborate, exquisitely worked examples on display. Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts and other personal objects; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments, embroidered fabrics, miniature pagodas used as containers for Buddhist scriptures; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)    * Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT' Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)    * Frick Collection: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING' Weighing in at 6 works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works that highlight Cimabue's radicalness without letting it completely steal the show. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes on Sunday. (Smith)    Museum of Modern Art: 'Eye on Europe: Prints, Books & Multiples, 1960 to Now' This is a woolly, at times idiosyncratic assemblage of more than 350 prints and multiple editions by 118 European artists. Although they are still often considered secondary mediums, the show charts how prints and multiple editions rose to prominence in the 1960s as an essentially democratic strategy, having largely to do with accessibility and affordability, as artists explored alternatives to conventional painting and sculpture. Following this are displays of artwork by contemporary artists working in these mediums. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; closes on Monday. (Genocchio)    National Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam, 1819-1865' This show is the first museum survey of the career of this 19th-century American painter and is accompanied by a weighty monograph. His early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were a talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio)    Parrish Art Museum: 'Roy Lichtenstein: American Indian Encounters' Lichtenstein is more popularly associated with his Pop paintings, often based on comic book images, than with the works here. But in the 1950s, using a somewhat Cubist style, he explored mythic characters like medieval knights or cowboys and Indians. ''Chief Before Teepee,'' an abstract oil painting, and ''Two Wild Indians,'' a drawing, both from 1952, were unearthed by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation for the show's run at the Montclair Art Museum last year. Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, Ext. 32, parrishart.org; closes on Sunday. (Carol Vogel)    'Replanting the Community Garden' Organized by the artist Michael Tong, this show consists of two environmental pieces. William Brent, a professional landscape designer, contributes an ''Urban Air Scrubber,'' a closet-size smoker's lounge filled with air-purifying plants. A wood construction by Adam Brent is made of shelves holding miniature plants; it's a model for real plant holders and shelters that might be built in tight urban spaces, an idea that makes particular sense at this venerable, financially vulnerable gallery in a neighborhood where grass-roots empty-lot gardens have long been a source of local pride. Tribes Gallery, 285 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 674-3778, www.tribes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum' Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)    Paul McCarthy: 'Between Beauty and the Beast' Despite the scattershot nature of this show, mostly of work from around 1990 to 2004, Mr. McCarthy's signature moves and gestures are all here. His scatological side is represented by a selection of drawings featuring crude, sexualized doodles and misspelled messages, unpublishable here, that recall graffiti in public restrooms. In ''Masks'' (1994), the abject and uncanny are explored in a suite of large-scale color photographs of soiled silicon masks that mix fear with surprising pathos. His work also continues to reveal itself as a corrective, or perhaps an addendum, to more antiseptic strains of 1960s Pop. Rather than celebrating or criticizing popular images, Mr. McCarthy plays the role of analyst, musing on the creepy cheerfulness of cartoon characters and their incarnations as amusement park mascots. The seven bright-hued sculptures of ''Dwarf Head'' (2000) borrow from Walt Disney's ''Snow White.'' Only here the dwarfs look decapitated and cryogenically preserved, their cuteness transformed into an eternal, chilling blankness. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy ZPark South, Suite 8D, (212) 955-1785, nyehaus.com; closes tomorrow.

3," INTERNATIONAL A3-15    U.S. Says Iranian Officials Were Seized in Iraq Raid  The American military is holding at least four Iranians in Iraq, including men the White House called senior military officials, who were seized in raids last week on groups suspected of conducting attacks on security forces, according to officials.   A1    Ethiopia at War in Somalia  Ethiopia officially plunged into war with Somalia's Islamist forces, bombing targets inside Somalia and putting Ethiopian ground troops on the march in an escalation that could turn Somalia's internal crisis into a religious conflict that engulfs the entire Horn of Africa.   A1    At Axis of Episcopal Split  Archbishop Peter J. Akinola of Nigeria, a man whose reputation has been built on his stance against homosexuality and who has created an offshoot of his Nigerian church in North America, has become the spiritual head of 21 conservative churches in the United States. The churches opted to leave the Episcopal Church over its decision to consecrate a gay bishop and allow churches to bless same-sex unions.   A1    Iran Defiant After Sanctions  Iran reacted defiantly to the United Nations Security Council resolution imposing sanctions over the country's nuclear program. Iranian officials vowed to continue efforts to enrich uranium and warned that the sanctions would change Iran's relationship with the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency.   A14    Hamas Rebuffs Israeli Move  Hamas, the militant Islamic faction that leads the Palestinian government, dismissed as inconsequential the Israeli concessions made a day earlier to Mahmoud Abbas, above, the Palestinian Authority president.   A10    Wealth Disparity in Argentina  Five years after an economic collapse in Argentina, its economy has grown faster than any other in South America. But the fruits of the expansion are not being shared by all, and as a result, economic inequality has intensified.   A3    Sri Lankan Rebels Take Ship  Tension between Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tiger rebels increased after a Jordanian ship drifted into waters close to a rebel stronghold and was forcibly boarded, officials said.   A4    A Split on Plan for Viking Ships  The University of Oslo has decided to move three grand Viking ships, probably by truck and barge, to a new museum across town, despite claims that the thousand-year-old oak vessels could fall apart en route.   A8    Polish-German Border Dispute  A lawsuit by a German claims group has prompted Poland to call into question a treaty meant to settle forever the borders between the two countries.   A8    NATIONAL A16-22    Famed Surgeon's Care Stirs Debate on Treatment  When Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, then 97 and one of the most influential heart surgeons in history, suffered a dissecting aortic aneurysm, he became the oldest survivor of an operation he had devised to repair torn aortas. But his treatment also stirred debate over how far to go in treating someone so old, and making risky decisions that can save lives.   A1    Pork Projects Cost Seats  A timeworn bit of political wisdom has been that larding one's district with pork projects can act as an incumbency protection program, and the Republican leaders in Congress ardently followed that principle. But the pursuit of earmarks -- special local projects that circumvent the normal budgeting process -- cost two senators and four House members their seats in the last election.  A1    Country Church Loses Name  The 152-year-old Hog Mountain Baptist Church in Georgia has been renamed after a posh new subdivision nearby, Hamilton Mill. That move makes perfect sense to some but has raised an outcry among old-timers, current and former church members, and the local historical society.  A16    Boston City Hall May Relocate  Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston has proposed selling City Hall, a hulking gray concrete box of a building, and moving city government to an undeveloped waterfront parcel. But the announcement has strengthened the will of City Hall's defenders; some see it as a seminal building in the city's history and do not want it to move to a hard-to-reach waterfront location.  A16    Nuclear Firms Seek Guidelines  The nuclear power industry has asked the government to specify how new nuclear plants should minimize damage from airplane attacks, weeks after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission decided not to institute requirements on building new plants that are tougher than the rules that prevailed decades ago, when the old ones were built.   A16    Schwarzenegger Injures Leg  Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California broke his leg while skiing with his family in Sun Valley, Idaho. He was taken to a hospital for X-rays and discharged with a fracture to his right femur. A16    OBITUARIES B7    Bertram A. Powers  A head of the New York printers union who led the 114-day newspaper strike of 1962-63 and later negotiated a contract that guaranteed his members jobs for life as computers outmoded their craft, he was 84. B7    NEW YORK/REGION B1-6    NYU Fund-Raising Efforts Grow Increasingly Complex  John Sexton, president of New York University, is heading an increasingly elaborate campaign to bring in $2.5 billion, including development teams and marketers who scour for every graduate with money. University officials say the measures are necessary to cover the cost of providing education and financial aid.  B1    Split Over H.I.V. Test Consent  A yearlong effort by New York City's health commissioner to do away with a state requirement that patients give their written consent before being tested for H.I.V. has created a sharp rift among doctors and advocates for people with H.I.V. and AIDS.  B1    Town Is Center of Deaf Life  Rochester, N.Y., is home to the nation's largest deaf population per capita, with about 90,000 people who are deaf or hard of hearing living in its metropolitan area. The community's embracing of all things deaf has in turn provided comfort to a city where many of its industries and its young people have fled for more prosperous parts.  B1    Long List to Vie for Council Seat  The list of Brooklynites who are considering running for the City Council seat of Yvette C. Clark, who was elected to Congress, is staggering by any standard -- estimated to be from 18 to 25 candidates long.  B1    BUSINESS DAY C1-8    Flaws in Microsoft's Vista  Microsoft is facing an early crisis of confidence in the quality of its Windows Vista operating system as computer security researchers and hackers have begun to find potentially serious flaws in the version that was released to corporate customers late last month.   C1    Ardor Cools for Telenovelas  The low-budget soap opera genre called telenovelas has become the staple of television in Latin America, spurring CBS, ABC and NBC to announce plans to develop telenovelas for American audiences. But not a single show has since been produced by any of the major networks.   C1    Silence on Stock Options  Jim Balsillie, the chairman of Research In Motion, creator of the BlackBerry, has yet to comment on the review of R.I.M.'s past stock options grants. The company has given few details on the review to investors or regulators, making it difficult to assess its potential impact.   C1    Hewlett's Big Aspirations  Hewlett-Packard's turnaround was verified this year when profits from PCs, corporate servers and storage devices nearly doubled from last year. It sold more PCs than any other maker and claimed the title of the world's largest technology company.   C1    Business Digest C2    SPORTSMONDAY D1-7    Soccer Jerseys Give Ad Space  In the 2007 season, Major League Soccer plans to sell space to sponsors on the front of the jerseys of 13 teams for a minimum of $500,000 a year. Each team will kick $200,000 into a pool shared among league clubs, and the decision is another way for the league to find a seat at the table in the global soccer marketplace.

6," Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton (''Everybody Loves Raymond'') star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    Broadway    'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)    'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included.) Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday-season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Anita Gates)    'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)    'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom-night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)    * 'KAOS'  Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)    'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)    'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)    'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER'  As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'TWO TRAINS RUNNING'  Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Buggé's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful ''Copenhagen''-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 362-0329. (Gates)    'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Spectacles    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'CIRCUS OZ' Welcome holiday entertainment (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25).

Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200.

The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'THE ATHEIST' Chris Pine stars in Ronan Noone's generally compelling if not always credible one-man drama about a reporter who casually ruins lives trying to make his reputation with a big story (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'DARK MATTERS' Elizabeth Marvel plays a rural housewife who may be consorting with extraterrestrials in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's risible new drama about space critters bent on beginning a new race. Pure hokum (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444); closing tonight. (Isherwood)    'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Anne Midgette)    * 'HOME' Almost nothing happens in David Storey's ''Home'' -- except to those lucky enough to be in the audience, who are likely to find themselves profoundly touched by this portrait of four lost souls in a home for the mentally challenged or disturbed. The play hasn't been seen much since it was on Broadway in 1970, but the Actors Company Theater's production makes you wonder why. The performances by the four leads, Simon Jones, Larry Keith, Cynthia Harris and Cynthia Darlow, are simply exquisite. Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Molière's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'THE TAKING OF MISS JANIE' This revival of Ed Bullins's 1974 allegory about race relations and lament for the lost ideals of the '60s is well acted and politically elegant (1:25). The Henry Street Settlement's Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'THAT TIME OF YEAR' Who would have thought that fruitcake jokes could still be funny? But three singing fruitcakes are among the daffy high points of this original musical revue, which surprises repeatedly by getting laughs from standard-issue seasonal themes both Jewish and Christian. There are clunkers, but you leave feeling that the season's a bit brighter (2:00). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)    'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future where the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)    'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)    'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)    * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)    'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)    'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)    'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)    'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)    'DÉJÀ VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)    * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)    'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)    'FAMILY LAW' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Spanish) Exploratory variations on that old saw ''Like father, like son'' are the thematic heart of this third installment in the Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman's semiautobiographical trilogy of films about fatherhood. The delicate, bittersweet comedy about the relationship of father-and-son lawyers prepares you for an eruption of high drama that never arrives. (Stephen Holden)    * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic exposé of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)    * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)    'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)    * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)    'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)    'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)    'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh attempts to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)    'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)    * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)    'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)    * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)    * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)    * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)    'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly-named documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's ''Drawing Restraint 9,'' a love story in which he and his partner Björk dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis)    'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)    'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel lulls you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)    'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)    'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)    'THE SECRET LIFE OF WORDS' (No rating, 87 minutes) The heart and soul of this movie is the shattering 10-minute confession of a mysteriously glum, hearing-impaired young woman (Sarah Polley) to a burn victim (Tim Robbins) she is nursing on an oil rig in the Irish Sea. The strongest moments in the film, are those that focus on the central couple. (Holden)    * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)    'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis)    'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)    'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)    * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)    Film Series    THE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tonight through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of the innovative French New Wave director continues this weekend with four features. ''Divertimento,'' Mr. Rivette's shortened version of ''La Belle Noiseuse,'' is his own four-hour study of the artistic process. ''The Story of Marie and Julien'' (2003), a romantic mystery starring Emmanuelle Béart, is his most recent film. ''Secret Defense'' (1998), said to have been inspired by Hitchcock's ''Vertigo,'' stars Sandrine Bonnaire as a scientist whose father died mysteriously. ''The Gang of Four'' (1989) is an adventure about acting students and terrorism. (Through Dec. 31.) 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Anita Gates)    FRANZ WAXMAN: MUSIC FOR THE CINEMA (Tomorrow, Sunday and Wednesday) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Waxman (1906-67), the German composer, with a 21-film retrospective. This weekend's films include ''Sunset Blvd.'' (1950), for which Waxman won his first Oscar; ''The Two Mrs. Carrolls'' (1947), a film noir with Humphrey Bogart as the villain: and ''Mr. Skeffington'' (1944), one of Bette Davis's most memorable melodramas. (Through Jan. 17.) Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)    THE RETURN OF THOMAS H. INCE (Tonight, Wednesday and Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art's two-week tribute to Ince (1880-1924), the silent-era director, producer, screenwriter and murder victim (aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht), continues this weekend. The full-length features, to be screened with two shorts, are ''Civilization'' (1916), a war drama in which Jesus (George Fisher) appears as a peace advocate, and ''The Typhoon'' (1914), a drama starring Sessue Hayakawa. (Through Dec. 29.) Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates)    SPANISH CINEMA NOW (Tonight, Sunday and Tuesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's 15th celebration of Spain's film industry concludes next week. The final weekend's features include Javier Rebollo's ''Lola'' (2006), about a voyeur obsessed with his neighbor, and Edgar Neville's ''Flamenco'' (1952), which stars noted Spanish singers and dancers .

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    JAI AGNISH, BEN AND VESPER, LENNY SMITH (Thursday) A night in Brooklyn with three underground songwriters from New Jersey. Mr. Agnish, an accomplice of Sufjan Stevens and a sincere indie-rock Christian, sings guilelessly about his faith (he gives a ''thumbs-up to Jesus'') in songs that join acoustic folk with jerky, silly electronics. The male-female duo Ben and Vesper play droopy, forlorn acoustic ballads, and the gospel-folk singer Lenny Smith might be called the father of the scene: his son is Daniel Smith, leader of the perhaps-sincere, perhaps-mocking Christian band Danielson Famile. At 9 p.m., Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Ben Sisario)    BENEVENTO-RUSSO DUO (Wednesday) The keyboardist Marco Benevento and the drummer Joe Russo have had a gradual rise on the jam-band circuit with kinetic meanderings that usually begin in peaceful soul-funk and end up in poundingly insistent climaxes that might as well be punk rock. They play a fifth-anniversary show at the Knitting Factory's tiny downstairs Old Office. At 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $25. (Sisario)    BOGMEN (Tonight and tomorrow night) The fence-mending reunion thing worked well for '90s alternative giants like the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., so what about the littler guys? A decade ago, the Bogmen were one of the biggest local draws in New York, mingling cynical lyrics with propulsive guitar riffs and funk rhythms. It was textbook alt-rock, but the Bogmen struggled to find a national audience and disbanded in 1999. The band's three-night return concludes this weekend. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)    BOUNCING SOULS, WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETy (Thursday) Bouncing Souls, the punk kings of New Jersey, have been going strong for nearly two decades and show no signs of slowing down. Their latest album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is, like each one before it, chock-full of adrenalized ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. The World/Inferno Friendship Society's ''red-eyed soul'' is a snarky mix of ska, punk and horn-driven retro R&B. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $16. (Sisario)    DAVID BROZA (Sunday) The Israeli songwriter David Broza has recorded songs in Hebrew, English and Spanish, singing earnestly and playing virtuosic guitar that connects the Middle East, flamenco and rock.

(Jon Pareles)    THOMAS DOLBY, BT (Tomorrow) Thomas Dolby entered pop eternity in the guise of a wild-haired mad scientist, with the 1983 novelty hit ''She Blinded Me With Science.'' This year he returned after a long absence -- in his other life he has been an innovative creator of ring tones -- largely in the same gearhead persona (sans the hair). He shares a bill with BT, the king of garish house music. At 9 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100, canalroom.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)    ELYSIAN FIELDS (Tonight) Elysian Fields plays languid songs that sound best in a late-night haze, as Jennifer Charles's breathy voice hints at decadence and vulnerability while Oren Bloedow wraps the songs in slinky, deadpan guitar. At 11:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Pareles)    FAB FAUX (Tuesday and Wednesday) There are Beatles tribute acts, and then there are Beatles tribute acts. This one, featuring the bassist Will Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. For these two concerts, it will perform the White Album. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $35, sold out Wednesday. (Sisario)    * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight and tomorrow night, Tuesday through Thursday) The strongest incarnation so far of the singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. (Through Dec. 30.) At 8:30, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden)    FISHBONE (Thursday) Starting in the mid-'80s, this willfully manic Los Angeles group took up George Clinton's challenge that funk bands can play rock as well as anybody, and threw in ska, punk and metal, too, becoming a primary influence on generations of genre-jumbling bands. The current version of Fishbone includes only two original members, the bassist John Norwood Fisher and the top-hatted wild-man singer Angelo Moore, who could not possibly be replaced. With Shootyz Groove, Eclectic Collective and Butterbrain. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door.

(Sisario)    PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tuesday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students offer a meat-and-potatoes program of ''classic rock favorites.'' At 7 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $15. (Sisario)    GREY DOES MATTER (Tonight) Before he acquired his current band, Jason Crawford, the polymath who records as Grey Does Matter, used to take a reprogrammed Nintendo Gameboy along with him to help perform his spare, guitar-synthesizer songs of disconnection and boyish obsession (''The wind gets in and burns the skin like a battleground super ninja''). At 9:30, with Tall Hands and Hello Nurse, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $8. (Sisario)    HADAG NAHASH (Sunday) Hip-hop has reached every corner of the planet, including Israel, where the personal inevitably becomes political. ''Nine is the number of times I was too close to a terrorist attack,'' goes one song by this Jerusalem group, one of the most popular in Israel, whose name translates as Snake Fish. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40 and $55. (Sisario)    HATEBREED (Thursday) Like a restaurant that serves only one dish, Hatebreed, a veteran metalcore band from New Haven, sticks steadfastly to a hyper-aggressive churn of mosh-ready guitar riffs and barked vocals that all seem to have one message: ''Destroy everything/Decimate what threatens me.'' Hey, it's more consistent than Denny's. Also on the bill are Sick of It All, Suffocation, Crowbar, Full Blown Chaos and Subzero. At 7 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $23 in advance, $25 at the door.

Tomorrow features the power-pop LeeVees, whose signature song is ''How Do You Spell Hanukkah?''; Tim Fite, whose songs about ''kicking every can in New York City'' go from clean country to aggressive noise; and the comedian Michael Schowalter. Sunday is Golem, which plays rockish arrangements of Eastern European folk songs, and the D.J. SoCalled. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $12 in advance or $15 at the door tomorrow, $18 in advance or $25 at the door on Sunday. (Sisario)    JEFFREY LEWIS (Tuesday) A veteran of the scruffy antifolk circuit that produced the Moldy Peaches and Regina Spektor, Jeffrey Lewis has a severe case of logorrhea that is not confined to his music. A gifted cartoonist, he combines his meandering monologues about everyday life and earnest bohemianism with storyboard history lessons. (Topics have included Karl Marx and the British postpunk stalwarts the Fall.) With Schwervon and Prewar Yardsale. At 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $8. (Sisario)    MARTINA McBRIDE (Tonight) A hitmaker with a rich, confident voice and that most important pop-country qualification, malleability, Ms. McBride concludes her ''Joy of Christmas'' tour, a multimedia spectacle of standards and carols in which, as one of the show's producers has said, ''one minute you're in a quaint village underneath a Christmas tree, the next minute you're in Bethlehem crossing the desert and the next you have a World War II, Bob Hope/Bing Crosby vibe.'' At 7:30, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $58 to $88. (Sisario)    MOONEY SUZUKI (Tonight) One of the sharpest and loudest garage-rock bands in town -- in sound as well as dress -- the Mooney Suzuki draws on the frantic energy of mid-'60s British mod groups like the Who as well as the bruising blues-rock of Led Zeppelin.

(Sisario)    ED PALERMO BIG BAND (Wednesday) Mr. Palermo's band has devoted itself to the quick-changing music of Frank Zappa: sometimes fiercely complex, sometimes as simple as three chords, almost always delivered with biting humor. On Wednesday it plays with Napoleon Murphy Brock, a singer and saxophonist who played with Zappa in the 1970s and '80s. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Cutting Room, 19 West 24th Street, Manhattan, (212) 691-1900, thecuttingroomnyc.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door.

(Chinen)    CHRIS BOTTI (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Botti is a trumpeter whose photogenic style and brooding sensuality suit current notions of the standard songbook as a lifestyle accessory.

(Chinen)    BOB DOROUGH (Tomorrow) For the generation that came of age in the 1970s Mr. Dorough is best known as the tunesmith behind the more slyly informative ditties on ''Schoolhouse Rock.'' He'll reach back at least a decade further here, on a set that will include ''Blue X-Mas,'' which he recorded with an unusual Miles Davis group in 1962. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    PAQUITO D'RIVERA AND THE PANAMERICAN JAZZ ENSEMBLE (Tuesday through Thursday) Few musicians have a better claim to pan-Americana than Paquito D'Rivera, the clarinetist and saxophonist who toured extensively with Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra. This engagement, at the club that bears Gillespie's name, will feature his more Latin-flavored tunes. (Through Dec. 31.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.

LONNIE SMITH (Tonight through Sunday) David Newman, the soulful tenor saxophonist long associated with Ray Charles, joins Dr. Lonnie Smith, whose unaccredited honorific has always been justified by his authority on the Hammond organ. Adding crisply to the conversation is the guitarist Peter Bernstein, a regular member of Dr. Smith's trio. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.

(Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    * 'DON CARLO' (Tomorrow) The powerhouse tenor Johan Botha is a hefty man and a stiff actor. But he certainly brings the vocal goods to the title role of Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlo,'' in John Dexter's production at the Metropolitan Opera. The winning cast includes Patricia Racette as Elisabeth, Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo, Olga Borodina as Eboli and the astounding German bass René Pape as Philip II. James Levine conducts the score magnificently. The final performance of the season is tomorrow afternoon. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)    'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tuesday) A rare sighting: new opera at the Met. Tan Dun's East-West fusion promises all the bells and whistles of a grand opera spectacle. Let's hope for the music, too. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Bernard Holland)    'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. Now on offer is Strauss's merry ''Fledermaus,'' performed with a rotating cast. The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35, $28 for students and 65+. (Vivien Schweitzer)    * 'I PURITANI' (Wednesday) It's been a while since an opera singer reached such heights that she entered the popular consciousness, but the soprano Anna Netrebko is embarked on a dizzying, meteoric rise. It's a worthy package: she's got the looks, she's got the voice, and when she's onstage, the emotional aloofness that marked her earlier aria albums is replaced with dramatic involvement. This season she is taking on, for the first time onstage, two of the bel canto roles featured on her 2004 album ''Sempre Libera'': Anina in Bellini's ''Sonnambula'' in Vienna and Elvira in the same composer's ''Puritani'' at the Met now. Eric Cutler is her Arturo, John Relyea is Giorgio and Patrick Summers conducts. But Anna is the main attraction: for bel canto fans, long accustomed to a starvation diet from the Met, it should be a wonderful holiday present. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anne Midgette)    'RIGOLETTO' (Tonight) The strong Spanish baritone Carlos Alvarez has taken over the title role in this Metropolitan Opera revival of Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production, which has its final performance of the season tonight. In his debut appearances at the Met, the young Polish tenor Piotr Beczala sings the rakish Duke of Mantua. The technically exquisite, if expressively timid, soprano Ekaterina Siurina sings Gilda. Friedrich Haider conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 tickets remaining. (Tommasini)    'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. Scott Bergeson conducts a cast that also includes Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno, Cornelia Götz as Queen of the Night, Stephen Milling as Sarastro and Robert Lloyd as the speaker. On Thursday, James Levine conducts and the mesmerizing German bass René Pape sings Sarastro. Tomorrow at 8:30, Thursday at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 to $220 tickets remaining tomorrow; sold out on Thursday. (Schweitzer)    Classical Music    * BARGEMUSIC (Sunday) Steven Beck has become nearly the resident pianist at Bargemusic in the last year and has proved to be an adaptable chamber player. In the Christmas Eve concert at this converted coffee barge, Mr. Beck has the stage to himself for a performance of Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. At 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $60. (Allan Kozinn)    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Today, tomorrow and Monday) The ''Medieval Christmas'' program by Frederick Renz and his supremely polished vocal and instrumental ensemble has been a seasonal favorite for years and is available on recordings from the group's Ex Cathedra label. But as new performers join the group, Mr. Renz has continued to refine its sound. The works at hand, drawn from all over medieval Europe, include Latin hymns, Spanish cantigas and pieces by Perotin and Hildegard von Bingen. Tonight at 8, and tomorrow and Monday at 3 and 8, St. James Chapel, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330, earlymusicny.org; $40; $20 for students. (Kozinn)    'MESSIAH' (Tomorrow) Handel's oratorio is so ubiquitous in these parts at this time of year that it should be no surprise it's made the Guinness World Records book: the Masterwork Chorus, founded in 1955, has given the most complete performances of the work. Quality, not quantity, of course, should be the benchmark, but the experience means that the group, based in New Jersey and conducted by Andrew Megill, can be relied on to turn out a pretty good show. Kiera Duffy, Leah Wool, Tony Boutté and Steven Condy are the vocal soloists. At 3 and 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 to $100. (Midgette)    NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA (Sunday and Thursday) A tradition is a habit that people like. It is also a good description of the New York String Orchestra's Christmas Eve concert at Carnegie Hall. In the first of two evenings (the second is Thursday), young players from the United States and Canada led by Jaime Laredo will offer an all-Mozart program. Mr. Laredo will also play the viola next to Jennifer Koh on violin in the E-flat Sinfonia Concertante. Thursday's concert includes works by Joan Tower and Beethoven, plus the Brahms D minor piano concerto with Leon Fleisher. Sunday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $18 to $48.

(John Rockwell)    Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Lots of men can wear tutus; point shoes are another matter. If you want to see how real men pirouette, check out the Trocks, as they perform classics like ''Swan Lake'' and creepy 20th-century ballets like ''The Cage.'' (Through Jan. 7.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 p.m. and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Claudia La Rocco)    FORCES OF NATURE DANCE THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Abdel R. Salaam has a voice of his own, one steeped in traditional modern dance taught him as a young rebel by Joan Miller and in the Afro-Caribbean dance forms he began early on to blend with modern dance. He is also a storyteller. In the program tonight, Mr. Salaam tackles the history and relationship of Christianity and Islam in his sprawling but powerful ''Eclipse: Vision of the Crescent and the Cross.'' The host is Woodie King Jr. Tomorrow's program, which includes ''The Life and Legend of Marie Laveau'' and the signature pieces ''Passion Fruit'' and ''Ancestral Earths,'' has Chuck Davis as host. At 7:30, Harlem Stages/Aaron Davis Hall, 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100, harlemstage.org; $25 to $100. (Jennifer Dunning)    I GIULLARI DI PIAZZA (Tonight) This New York-based Southern Italian folk music and dance company will celebrate the Winter Solstice, the longest night of the year, with a performance of ''Spider Dance,'' an ecstatic exorcism dance in which the performers jump like spiders. At 8, Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 665-4516; $20. (Dunning)    'HOLIDAY WONDERS' (Tonight through Sunday) A cast of 200 dancers and musicians will enact epic tales from the Tang Dynasty, lavishly costumed. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $35 to $125. (Dunning)    MoveOpolis! (Tonight and tomorrow) Richard Move has collaborated with the greats, like Mikhail Baryshnikov and Debbie Harry. He has also become the greats, as anyone who has seen his impersonation of Martha Graham can attest. Now he brings his new company to New York; who knows who might show up. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $15 and $25. (La Rocco)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker'' continues until Dec. 30, with nine performances this week alone. It may be hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to speak of the orchestra and stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Today, tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 1 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio)    Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum : 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design as a whole, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)    * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)    * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)    Queens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The exhibition tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video ''Everyday,'' which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)    Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City's Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-WorldWar II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com, through Dec. 29. (Glueck)    * 'THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS' Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed. They range from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto, whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, ''Portrait of a Bearded Man'' (1530-35), is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788) by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building -- though not its art -- was battered by Hurricane Katrina. Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, wildenstein.com, through Feb. 9. (Glueck)    Last Chance    DENNIS BALK: HAShISH Abstract Expressionism meets Graffiti photography. Cy Twombly in Cyberspace. Existential physics. The trajectories of car bombs. These phrases came to mind in front of Dennis Balk's garbled computer-generated drawings on canvas and digitally mixed color photographs. Randomness, violence and information overload are intimated with a handful of portrait-snapshots of Arab men, taken at a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, functioning as still points. Michael Steinberg Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-6232, michaelsteinbergfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    DAVID BATES This Texas painter's 14th New York solo show since 1983 features still lifes that bristle like carpentered objects, bayou swampscapes that make nature seem both beautiful and doomed, and portraits of angry Gulf Coast residents (taken from television) who got the short end of the stick when Hurricane Katrina passed through. The residents bring into the open the smoldering aggression that always keeps Mr. Bates's canvases from sitting quietly on the wall and give it the force of immediate human emotions and events. D. C. Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, (212) 247-2111; closes today. (Smith)    SLATER BRADLEY: 'THE ABANDONMENTS' This show features six new, contemplative video works. In ''Dark Night of the Soul'' (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)    Nathan Carter On the surface, Mr. Carter's work is all about communication, transportation and networks. Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there's an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com; closes today. (Schwendener)    * JOHN CURRIN The leading bad boy of figurative painting is trying his best to be even more provocative. While he usually paints in series, here he has many options under consideration: pornography, romance, still life, portraits of all kinds. The result is a Currin medley that functions as a kind of installation brought off with a new, somewhat vacuous facility. But the paintings with the most Currinesque goofiness and distortions are still the best. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes today. (Smith)    CHRIS DUNCAN: THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF PINK AND BROWN In his New York debut, this young artist from Oakland, Calif., continues the tradition of men who draw (and glue) by sewing that dates back at least to Alan Shields. His richly colored, semi-abstract works on paper, sometimes sewn together into expansive surfaces, combine geometric structures with scattered drips, accrue into playful but quietly magnetic mélanges of decorative and mystical, and East and West. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, baileygallery.com; closes today. (Smith)    ALLAN McCOLLUM: THE SHAPES PROJECT Long interested in works that question notions of originality and invention, Mr. McCollum has devised a computer program that could eventually generate a unique abstract motif for everyone in the world. In the meantime, he has produced and framed 7,056 of them (at small scale) and arranged them on a floor-to-ceiling ramp with 98 steps. The effect -- a stadium full of art looking at you, the viewer -- is quite amazing. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * GEORGE ORTMAN: EARLY CONSTRUCTIONS, NEW SCULPTURE In the late 1950s and early '60s, Mr. Ortman combined paint, canvas, plaster and wood into geometric reliefs whose every element was physically discrete. Hailed as exemplary ''specific objects'' by Donald Judd, they took some tips from Jasper Johns's flag and target paintings and gave others to Judd's own work. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, mitchellalgus.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    STEPHEN PRINA: THE SECOND SENTENCE OF EVERYTHING I READ IS YOU A quietly delirious multimedia environmental listening lounge that incorporates on painting, sculpture, design, appropriation, music and performance as well as its own shipping crates. The choral music, written and recorded by the artist and incorporating phrases from writing on art and economics, is especially nice. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * TL SOLEIN: INSULATUS In these large, ingeniously made works on paper, which combine stenciling, bright cutout collage and washy fields of color, Mr. Solein brings his considerable pictorial sense to bear on ''Moby-Dick.'' He borrows from 19th-century illustration and folk art as well as personal memory, creating intimate stage-set-like scenes that can evoke anything from puppet shows to Cubism. The results frequently dazzle and sustain comparison with equally well-sourced but better-known paper wizards, from Donald Baechler to Jockum Nordstrom. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-2161, luiserossgallery.com; closes tomorrow.

9,POP.,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/15/arts/music/15pop.html,POP.,"PSYCHIC ILLS Don’t drive home after seeing the Psychic Ills in concert. With throbbing drones of distorted guitar, harsh electronic buzzes and rhythms so raw and repetitive they sound almost tribal, this New York quartet is highly skilled at disorienting its audience. Yet there’s something exhilarating about its form of sonic hypnosis. The group has existed for only three years and is part of a close-knit scene of squally young New York bands. But its music conjures decades of the city’s avant-garde rock, from the white noise of the Velvet Underground and the claustrophobic electronica of Suicide to the sprawling half-psychedelic, half-punk guitar clouds of Sonic Youth — a tradition whose common thread is the musical illustration of the bad trip, the sensual or spiritual experience that twists into the horrific. This year the band released its debut album, “Dins,” as well as a spellbinding collection of its first singles, “Early Violence,” both on the Brooklyn-based Social Registry label. It ends a short national tour with this show at the Knitting Factory. Bad trips can be great. (Tomorrow at 10 p.m., with Indian Jewelry and Telepathe, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, 212-219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door.)
