This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using girly men as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.  BEN BRANTLEY    *+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BRANTLEY    * 'DEMOCRACY.' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    + 'GEM OF THE OCEAN.' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays that chronicles the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is over 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.  BRANTLEY    + ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER.' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother.'' Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    * 'PACIFIC OVERTURES.' The director Amon Miyamoto dazzled New Yorkers at the Lincoln Center Festival two years ago with his visiting Japanese-language production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's 1976 musical about American gunboat diplomacy as visited on 19th-century Japan. Now Mr. Miyamoto has revisited the show with an English-speaking, predominantly Asian-American cast, including B. D. Wong as the wryly omniscient narrator. The show's scenic and conceptual elements are essentially the same. But something has definitely been lost in the retranslation. The production does give beguiling due to Mr. Sondheim's silken, silvery score. But an uneasy tentativeness pervades the stage like a mist of perspiration (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Curtain at 7 p.m. through Thursday. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25.  BRANTLEY    '700 SUNDAYS.' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house in Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'WHOOPI.' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she's met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. This movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49 Ms. Goldberg is an established performer and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half dozen characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    Off Broadway    + 'THE BALTIMORE WALTZ.' Paula Vogel is indisputably the author of ''The Baltimore Waltz,'' but a decade of collective grief, rage and confusion surely played a part in its authorship, too. Ms. Vogel began work on the play shortly after her brother's death from AIDS in 1988. It was a deeply personal, even idiosyncratic expression of sorrow and love. But in the dozen years since its premiere at Circle Repertory, emotion surrounding the AIDS epidemic has inevitably cooled, and the play now must stand up to less emotionally inflected scrutiny. Sadly, on the evidence of Mark Brokaw's smart but dry production, the second in the Signature Theater's season devoted to Ms. Vogel's work, it mostly sags. This is partly due to a crucial piece of miscasting. Kristen Johnston is a talented actress, but she doesn't do poignancy convincingly. She makes all the right noises, but the submerged emotional charge that should bind the jumbled comic gambits of Ms. Vogel's comedy never fully emerges (1:25). Signature's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, (212) 244-7529. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    'BELLE ÉPOQUE.' The époque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle Époque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $70.  ISHERWOOD    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE.' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    'FAT PIG.' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    'THE FOREIGNER.' Matthew Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There is no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.  BRANTLEY    +'MODERN ORTHODOX.' It is said that God works in mysterious ways. Daniel Goldfarb's new play suggests He is not above employing obnoxious ones, too. In this snappy if superficial romantic comedy with a glossy cast (Molly Ringwald, Jason Biggs and Craig Bierko), Hannah and Ben, a young Jewish couple comfortably ensconced on Manhattan's Upper West Side, are provoked to question their commitment to each other -- and the depth of their religious feeling -- when Hershel Klein, an ill-mannered interloper from another borough and another sect, arrives on their doorstep demanding to be given harbor. Since the abrasive behavior of Hershel, played by Mr. Biggs, tends to indicate colossal bad manners more powerfully than spiritual enlightenment, the character's deployment as a catalyst is more than a little specious. But the soul-searching is primarily filler supplementing Mr. Goldfarb's bright comic swipes at intrafaith cultural clashes (1:30). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46 to $66.  ISHERWOOD    * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE.' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1900. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $60; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at box office one hour before the show.  ISHERWOOD    'A SECOND HAND MEMORY.' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Amid the pervasive aura of doom, Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors, who include Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos'' and a particularly fine Beth Fowler, provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences before our eyes, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    'FIVE BY TENN.' This selection of Tennessee Williams one-acts offers little cause for excitement. The four recently discovered plays are of some academic interest, but sparkling gems they aren't. ''Summer at the Lake,'' written in 1937, features principal characters who prefigure the combative mother and son in ''The Glass Menagerie.'' The play is just a fragment truncated by a melodramatic ending, but the voice already bears the hallmarks of Williams's style. But elsewhere the voice is diluted, distorted or disguised. The major disappointment is ''And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens,'' from around 1959, a sour story of a transvestite's degradation at the hands of a sailor, and one of a very few plays in which Williams dealt directly with homosexuality (3:00). Manhattan Theater Club, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $48; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets available at the box office up to an hour before the performance.  ISHERWOOD    *+ 'GUANTÁNAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM.'' ' On an anxious night you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: you are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. This calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.  BRANTLEY    *++ 'RECKLESS.' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'RODNEY'S WIFE.' Seemingly light conversation scrapes the skins of the characters in Richard Nelson's sharply etched study of dislocation, loneliness and sexual betrayal, directed by the playwright and and starring David Strathairn as a fading American movie star working in Rome. And you are always aware of the strain and snappishness that arises when people politely avoid saying what is on everyone's mind. Long before the unspoken is brought out for airing, Mr. Nelson and his fine cast have created a full emotional geography of a family, replete with deserts and bogs and patches of quicksand. Though the play, which traces the conflicts among the women in the life of Mr. Strathairn's alcoholic character, is centered on what movie ads used to call an ''illicit passion,'' there is nothing prurient about this production. What it offers instead is a deep and sorrowful understanding of how much loneliness there often is in lust (1:45). Playwrights Horizons Mainstage Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.  BRANTLEY    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'AFTER MIDNIGHT' Starring Giorgio Pasotti and Francesca Inaudi. Directed by Davide Ferrario (not rated, 89 minutes; in Italian, with English subtitles). This whimsical romantic comedy served with a heaping tablespoon of sugar is drenched in even more esoteric movie lore than that sentimental Italian crowd-pleaser ''Cinema Paradiso.'' Its poker-faced protagonist, Martino (Mr. Pasotti), is a wistful sad-eyed hermit who works as the custodian of Italy's National Museum of Cinema in Turin. Inside this solitary twilight world, he lives and works surrounded by old movie reels, vintage cameras and projectors. He is abruptly drawn out of his shell when a beautiful woman (Ms. Inaudi) on the run from the law seeks asylum in the museum. Depending on your tolerance for incessant movie references you may find ''After Midnight'' endearing or cloying.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'ALEXANDER' Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 173 minutes). There comes the moment in the career of many directors when they are compelled to tell the story of a great man in whose life they seem to see a glimmer of their own image. Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson each had Jesus. Now Oliver Stone has Alexander the Great, the Macedonian tyrant who cut a bloody swath through the ancient world to no obvious end other than, if Mr. Stone's big, blowsy movie is to believed, to get away from his kvetch of a mother. Olympias, played with nose-flaring gusto by Ms. Jolie, was the mother of all monstrous mothers, a literal snake charmer whose love for her only son had the stench of incestuous passion. For Alexander (Mr. Farrell, upstaged by an epically bad dye job), the Oedipal plot would only thicken because he also loved Olympias's most loathed enemy, her husband and his father, Philip, the King of Macedon (Mr. Kilmer). The struggle between Olympias and Philip, these primordial warring female and male forces, would be reproduced in Alexander's bisexual desires and his rapacious conquest of the feminized East. In other words, Alexander became his dad to waylay his mom.  MANOHLA DARGIS    * 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael García Bernal, Fele Martínez and Javier Cámara. Directed by Pedro Almodóvar (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). This Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless filmmakers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almodóvar, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grâce of ''Bad Education'' is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual.  HOLDEN    'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair, the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core. But Ms. Bening lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.  A.O. SCOTT    'BLADE: TRINITY' Starring Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson and Jessica Biel. Directed by David S. Goyer (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Snipes may have achieved the Hollywood dream of starring in a comic-book franchise that doesn't require real acting, but he doesn't seem to appreciate his good fortune in the disjointed, overlong ''Blade: Trinity,'' which bills itself as the series finale. The ''Blade'' movies demand only that the 42-year-old actor stay pumped up and ready for kung-fu action. But the only emotion his character, a glowering half-human, half-vampire-hunter of the undead, can muster in the third installment is a sense of mild irritation at having to go through the hassle. This episode is a choppy, forgetful, suspense-free romp that substitutes campy humor for chills.  HOLDEN    'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of charm and obvious intelligence? Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck.  DARGIS    'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy. The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community.  HOLDEN    'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play and exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.  SCOTT    'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan'' has been revisited numerous times. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. The film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote.  DARGIS    *  'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS' Starring Zhang Ziyi. Directed by Zhang Yimou (PG-13, 119 minutes; in Mandarin, with English subtitles). In the latest chapter of Mr. Zhang's triumphant reinvention as an action filmmaker, Ms. Zhang plays Mei, a blind courtesan who turns out to be a member of the Flying Daggers, a shadowy squad of assassins waging a guerrilla insurgency against the corrupt and decadent government. She is pursued by two government deputies, Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), whose loyalties come into question as the chase turns into a love triangle. Everyone is engaged in several layers of deceit, and some of the third-act revelations are more likely to provoke laughter than gasps of amazement. But realism is as irrelevant a criterion here as it would be in an Italian opera. The movie is about color, kineticism and the kind of heavy-breathing, decorous sensuality that went out of American movies when sexual candor came in. Though it is in constant, breathtaking motion, the picture is not especially moving. Unlike the greatest operas (in whatever medium), it inspires you to gasp, but not to weep.  SCOTT    * 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes tries to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced superheroes into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Mr. Bird uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world in which ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology.  SCOTT    *  'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost naïve belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging Kinsey's personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight.  SCOTT    'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Aquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their reveries and fantasies.  SCOTT    * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael García Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. García Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture, a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography.  SCOTT    * 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in the enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick ''Ocean's Twelve,'' a trio of crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean -- played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box-office entertainment, ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack, Mr. Pitt plays his second-in-command Rusty Ryan and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.  DARGIS    'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year-old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine.  HOLDEN    'THE POLAR EXPRESS' With the voices of Tom Hanks, Michael Jeter, Peter Scolare, Nona Gaye, Eddie Deezen and Charles Fleischer. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (G, 97 minutes). Based on the 32-page children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, this new animated feature has received attention for the advanced technology used to make the film and the heart-skipping amount of money reportedly spent to transpose the story from page to screen. I suspect that most moviegoers care more about stories and characters than how much money it took for a digitally rendered strand of hair to flutter persuasively in the wind. Nor will they care that to make ''Polar Express'' Mr. Hanks wore a little cap that transmitted a record of his movements to a computer, creating templates for five animated characters. It's likely, I imagine, that most moviegoers will be more concerned by the eerie listlessness of those characters' faces and the grim vision of Santa Claus's North Pole compound.  DARGIS    * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out.  SCOTT    * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future.  DARGIS    'THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE' With the voices of Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and Rodger Bumpass. Directed by Steven Hillenburg (PG, 88 minutes). If nautical nonsense is something you wish for, then this big-screen expansion of the popular Nickelodeon show will be just the ticket. SpongeBob and his best pal Patrick set off on a rambling quest to recover a stolen crown and prevent Plankton from taking over Bikini Bottom and driving poor Mr. Krabs out of business. If none of this makes sense to you, fear not; it won't necessarily make any more after the movie is done. In any case, the point of ''SpongeBob'' is not sense but nonsense, and the film, like the series, is a giddy celebration of pure childishness, which makes it a refreshing antidote to the glowering machismo that dominates so much pop culture.  SCOTT    * 'A TALKING PICTURE' Starring Leonor Silveira. Directed by Manoel de Oliveira (not rated, 95 minutes; in Portuguese, French and Italian, with English subtitles). With this sharply cut gem of a film, Mr. Oliveira again shows himself to be a master of the medium. Set in the present, his latest film centers on a history professor named Rosa Maria (Ms. Silveira), and her 7-year-old daughter who are sailing the Mediterranean on their way to Bombay. As they stop at ports from France to Turkey, the film takes the shape of a genial history lesson, one that grows progressively darker when you realize the message Mr. Oliveira has been delivering alongside all those seemingly benign tourist shots. It would give away too much to say what happens at the end of this dark journey across the geography of our current reality, only that this is the only film I can think of that, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, has so directly addressed the war on liberal democracies.  DARGIS    * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.  DARGIS    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to do them part, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes. DARGIS    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent rock and pop concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * ANTIBALAS, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Antibalas, which recently released its third album, ''Who Is This America?'' (Ropeadope), gives a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afro-beat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. It updates the funk and the political messages. Regular local appearances keep tightening up the band, and it's a show just watching more than a dozen musicians cram themselves onto a club stage and still find room to dance. Tonight at midnight; admission, $16 with a $15 minimum at the tables.  JON PARELES    ASHFORD AND SIMPSON, JERRY BUTLER, THE MANHATTANS, THE PERSUADERS, THE IMPRESSIONS, RAY, GOODMAN AND BROWN, Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Flatbush, (718) 951-4500. A generous bill of smooth soul, with the paeans to fidelity of Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, the gospel-charged Chicago soul of Jerry Butler, and the close harmonies and sweet promises of the Manhattans, the Impressions, the Persuaders and Ray, Goodman and Brown. Sunday night at 6; admission, $45 and $65.  PARELES    BEANS, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. Beans, formerly a member of the Anti-Pop Consortium, delivers sinuous, idiosyncratic hip-hop verses set to twitchy electronic beats. In October he released his second full-length solo album, ''Shock City Maverick'' (Beans), full of brittle electro tracks and rapping that sounds as if it could go on forever; the effect is often more impressive on stage than on CD. Tomorrow night doors open at 8, with Dub Trio and the Gray Kid; tickets are $10.  KELEFA SANNEH    BREAKING BENJAMIN, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. This grim-faced metal-grunge band sings about betrayal and alienation over bruising, down-tuned guitar riffs on its way to pop choruses. Like many other bands, it owes a lot to Tool, but its edge comes from its collaborator in songwriting, Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins. Sunday night, doors open at 6, with Flyleaf, Halogen and Thread opening; tickets, $15 in advance, $17 on Sunday.  PARELES    * SIMON CHARDIET, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500. Simon Chardiet is the kind of guitarist that bar-band fans dream of finding: a one-man twang meltdown who knows where surf meets blues, rockabilly meets klezmer, country meets punk. His songs are wryly frustrated; his guitar solos assuage his troubles with the grand sweep of American music. Tonight at 10; free admission.  PARELES    CONCERT FOR HAITI, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Haiti has been battered lately by Hurricane Jeanne and political turmoil. This concert raises money for Artists' Relief Fund for Haiti, and it brings together a hip-hop musician with Haitian roots -- Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, and his Refugee Crew -- with a lineup of Haitian musicians, including the jazzy compas band Zin, Dadou Pasquet, Eddy François, Michou, St. Juste and others. Sunday night at 7; tickets, $20, with a $15 minimum at the tables.  PARELES    ELYSIAN FIELDS, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. With Jennifer Charles's smoky voice and Oren Bloedow's electric guitar, Elysian Fields conjure a haunted, late-night atmosphere with songs full of love and trouble. Tonight at 9; tickets, $12.  PARELES    MIKE ERRICO, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. This songwriter ponders love, God, fame, drinking and ''light conversation when there's nothing left to say,'' with his voice quavering and shambling around the strumming of his guitar. For these shows he's bringing a full band and his Holiday Omens, predicting the future of audience members. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets, $12 in advance, $15 tomorrow, with a two-drink or $12 minimum.  PARELES    THE FANTASTIC FOUR, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Here's yet another jam-band recombination. It should revolve around funk, as it brings together Robert Walter, the keyboardist who leads his 20th Congress, with Eric Krasno, the guitarist in Soulive. Cheme Gastelum, the saxophonist from 20th Congress, and Adam Deith, on drums from the band Lettuce, complete the quartet. Tomorrow night at midnight in the Main Space; tickets are $12 in advance, $15 tomorrow.  PARELES    * 50 FOOT WAVE, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Avenue A, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Kristin Hersh was the songwriter behind the jumpy, oddly cantilevered tunes and surreal imagery of Throwing Muses. After a stretch of more serene songs, she has started her hardest-rocking group yet, the trio 50 Foot Wave, which can sound like Throwing Muses charged up by Husker Du. Tonight at 11, with Aberdeen City at 10, Anders Parker of Varnaline at 9 and Redletter at 8; the admission is $12.  PARELES    HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, off Frost Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770. Howard Fishman, a singer and guitarist, leads a group that often harks back to 1930's jazz, but doesn't get stuck in revivalism. It just can't resist poking around America's musical basements and attics. Tomorrow night at 10:30, after the Hipster's Holiday Show revue at 7. Admission is free.  PARELES    * JOANNA NEWSOM, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Earlier this year this extraordinary harpist and singer-songwriter released ''The Milk-Eyed Mender'' (Drag City), full of beautiful, intensely self-aware songs that flirt with nonsense. While Ms. Newsom she picks broken chords on the harp, her riveting voice swoops from an elegant sigh up to a throaty yawp and back. And often her seemingly indecipherable lyrics (''There are bats all dissolving in a row'') suddenly turn shivery and direct: ''O, morning without warning like a hole/ And I watch you go.'' These are Christmas concerts, and there's a dress code: ''A sweater with a knit cap or scarf, please.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7:30; tickets, $15.  SANNEH    MIRACLE ON 125TH STREET, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5301. Here's an odd pairing for a Christmas concert: Be Be Winans, a member of pop-gospel's leading family, and the songwriter Carly Simon, making a rare live public appearance. They will be singing Christmas songs and their own hits; Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 is also scheduled to appear. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets, $55 to $300.  PARELES    SCISSOR SISTERS/VHS OR BETA, Hammerstein Ballroom at the Manhattan Center, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740. Twisted 1970's revivalism powers the Scissor Sisters, who put themselves on the map with a disco-powered remake of Pink Floyd's ''Comfortably Numb'' and show an unabashed fondness for Elton John. VHS or Beta is a band from Kentucky, but it could just as easily come from the downtown New York scene that is delving into the dance-rock hybrids of the early 1980's. Sunday night, doors open at 6:30; tickets, $25.  PARELES    * JANE SIBERRY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Ms. Siberry is always trying another collaboration or another musical strategy. Her sweetly tousled voice, her sly intelligence, her determination to explore and her playful fascination with family, archetype and myth can all lead to intimate epiphanies. Tonight at 7; tickets, $25 with a two-drink or $12 minimum.  PARELES    RONNIE SPECTOR'S CHRISTMAS PARTY, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Mr. Spector has been belting Christmas songs since her days as the leader of the Ronnettes. Along with ''Frosty the Snowman'' and ''I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,'' her contributions to Phil Spector's 1963 Christmas album, she's also likely to apply her gutsy voice to her indelible hits, like ''Be My Baby.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 9; tickets, $30 in advance, $35 the day of show, with a $10 minimum.  PARELES    TAVERAS/FRANCE JOLI, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, at 11th Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 239-2672. The five Taveras brothers harmonized on mid-1970's hits that helped usher in the disco era, among them ''It Only Takes a Minute'' and ''More Than a Woman.'' France Joli was a teenager when she had her biggest dance hit, ''Come to Me,'' in 1979. Sunday night at 9:30; admission, $20, $10 with a coupon from www.copacabanany.com.  PARELES    * DANNY TENAGLIA, Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. Mr. Tenaglia is one of the city's greatest and most reliable -- and most relentless -- dance-music D.J.'s. Expect a long, delirious night: Mr. Tenaglia is beloved not only for his catholic approach to house music (from clattering rhythm-only tracks to sleek electronic confections), but for his extraordinary stamina too. Tonight after 10; tickets, $35.  SANNEH    WHITE OUT, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The improvising duo of Lin Culbertson, on synthesizers and vocals, and Tom Surgal on drums, gets even noisier with two guest guitarists, Thurston Moore and Jim O'Rourke from Sonic Youth. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10; admission, $12 a set.  PARELES    PAUL WINTER, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at West 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 662-2133. Mr. Winter's annual winter solstice shows are reverent one-world pageants and ecumenical rituals, full of reassurance, good intentions and candy-coated exoticism. This is his 25th solstice celebration, and it promises to be the most theatrical, complete with an appearance by the aerialist Philippe Petit. Mr. Winter's jazz-tinged New Age ensemble will be joined by the uilleann piper Davy Spillane, from Ireland; the hand-drum virtuoso Glen Velez; the 18-member African-American Forces of Nature dance and percussion ensemble; and the Dmitri Pokrovsky Ensemble, a nine-member Russian vocal and dance group. Tonight at 7:30 and tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; tickets, $32 to $72.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BABY JANE DEXTER, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609. Ms. Dexter, a natural rock-blues belter who refrains from full-tilt shouting, roams all over the place, from Cole Porter to R.E.M. to Rod McKuen to the Rolling Stones, in her new show ''Bread and Gravy.'' If her bold re-evaluations of songs don't always work, they tear away the associations crusted on songs we think we know to reveal new avenues of interpretation. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:15. Cover: $25; $15 minimum.  HOLDEN    * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, Manhattan, (212) 339-4095. The smoothest crooner in show business and one of the most dedicated archivists of popular song salutes Christmas, Hanukkah and the classic ballad in his show, ''Holiday Heart Songs.'' Mr. Feinstein has developed into such an accomplished stand-up entertainer that if it were 1965, he would be the host of his own network variety show. The ballads at which he excels include ''Two for the Road,'' ''I Concentrate on You,'' and John Bucchino's semiclassical ''Grateful.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $60; $40 minimum for the early shows and $30 minimum for the late shows.  HOLDEN    JASON GRAAE, Helen's (see above). A biting wit that flirts with sarcasm and a real singing voice are talents that don't often coincide in the same performer. But Mr. Graae, a show-business jack-in-the-box in the twilight of his potential as a Broadway juvenile lead has both. As a bonus, he plays the clarinet and oboe. Part music, part comedy, his engaging show ''Coupe de Graae'' is a whip-smart insider's tour of the show-business scuffle from New York to Los Angeles. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7. Cover: $25; two-drink minimum.  HOLDEN    * ANDREA MARCOVICCI, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Authentic glamour may be an oxymoron. But Ms. Marcovicci becomes its embodiment when she performs. In her new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire,'' she suggests a latter-day hybrid of Audrey Hepburn, the most gracious, elegant and beautifully spoken of Hollywood princesses, and Mabel Mercer, that ruefully witty, all-wise, healing muse of a thousand romantic sorrows. Like Mercer's, her singing is really speech-song executed with an elocutionary flourish and stylized acting. The show weaves music, biography and analysis of Astaire iconography into a definitive career summary. It focuses, in particular, on his relationships with the composers who wrote for him. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $60, with a $55 dinner required at the early shows and a $20 minimum at the late shows.  HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue, ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $40.  HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semiretirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his signature songs -- ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark'' -- along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * PETER BERNSTEIN QUARTET WITH BRAD MEHLDAU, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. The guitarist Peter Bernstein was all over the small jazz clubs in New York 10 years ago, as was the pianist Brad Mehldau. Here Mr. Mehldau plays sideman to Mr. Bernstein, with Larry Grenadier on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. They've done this before, for ''Heart's Content,'' a recent album on Criss Cross, and a few recent gigs in New York, at which Mr. Bernstein played his organized, burnished Grant Green-inspired style to perfection, and Mr. Mehldau went far out on thrilling tangents that you don't hear as much in his own band. Sets are tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 9, 11 and 12:30 p.m.; cover charge, $25 with a $10 minimum.  BEN RATLIFF    HENRY GRIMES TRIO, Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove, West Village, (212) 924-0562. Since his great comeback last year, the bassist Henry Grimes has played in trios with dozens of musicians. This is a new group, with the saxophonist Charles Gayle -- an icon of second-wave free jazz -- and the drummer Chad Taylor. Tonight at 8 p.m.; admission, $15.  RATLIFF    ROY HARGROVE AND CEDAR WALTON QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Usually Jackie McLean has been the horn soloist in front of Cedar Walton's piano trio at the Vanguard for the two weeks before Christmas. When he was sidelined last year with an injury, his fill-in was the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, whose investigations in ballads and bop and expressive melodic improvisation keep sounding more mature. Both he and Mr. Walton have decided that the experiment worked. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11 p.m.; cover charge, $20 with a $10 drink minimum.  RATLIFF    JUNIOR MANCE TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. In his mid-70's, Mr. Mance is an excitable, physical player who throws himself into fast tempos and splashy, jubilant fancies that are not heard much outside Oscar Peterson. But he is also an earthy blues-and-bop player from Chicago; his résumé includes time in the bands of Dinah Washington, Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge, $20 with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    ORGAN SUMMIT WITH JIMMY McGRIFF, DR. LONNIE SMITH, REUBEN WILSON, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. The sound of the Hammond B-3 organ, tenor saxophone and guitar has aged well, as it turns out: no matter how tightly it clings to its clichés, it is a durable American music, an effective R & B-ization of the jazz repertory and a jazz-ization of the R & B repertory. These are organists of the same generation: Jimmy McGriff, Lonnie Smith and Reuben Wilson all started out in the early 60's. And here they go up against one another, wringing earthy soul out of their instrument. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set tomorrow; cover charge, $32.50 tonight and Sunday, $35 tomorrow with a $10 minimum all nights.  RATLIFF    * MARCUS ROBERTS TRIO, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, www.jazzlincolncenter.org. What makes Mr. Roberts special, rather than just a gifted pianist with a deep, clean touch and a good historian of jazz from ragtime onward, is the way he moves against type. He is a self-conscious performer who loves melody, speed, volume and polyrhythm and knows that audiences like those things too. But finally all these devices work in the service of creating chilling moments. Sometimes he chords thickly through a few choruses of a song, growing louder and louder -- and even insanely loud -- or finishes a song by depressing some keys and holding them there for a minute. These are tricks, but they are audience-demolishers. His trio includes Roland Guerin on bass and Jason Marsalis on drums. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge, $30 with a $10 minimum at the tables and a $5 minimum at the bar.  RATLIFF    ADAM ROGERS GROUP, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. Adam Rogers is easily one of the best jazz guitarists in New York, the next step in the tradition of swinging mainstream players -- in the line of Pat Martino and George Benson, though he can detour into rock and country as well. Music is tonight at 10 and 11:45. Cover charge, $10 with a two-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    * 'SUITE FOR HUMAN NATURE': LINCOLN CENTER JAZZ ORCHESTRA, Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. It's the latest long-form piece by Wynton Marsalis, this one commissioned by the Washington Performing Arts Society, with a libretto by Diane Charlotte Lampert. It is a fable about Mother Nature and Father Time, for children as well as adults, featuring the orchestra led by Mr. Marsalis and the singers Milt Grayson and Jennifer Sanon, as well as the Boys Choir of Harlem. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m.; tickets, $10 to $150.  RATLIFF    TANGO MEETS JAZZ FESTIVAL, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. The Argentine pianist and composer Pablo Ziegler, a protégé of Astor Piazzola who recorded an album of tango piano duets with Emanuel Ax not long ago, has been working on an original version of tango-jazz. He brings a fairly full realization of it to the Jazz Standard this weekend, for the second year running, with this regular Argentine quartet and special guest soloists: the vibraphonist Stefon Harris (tonight) and the tenor-saxophonist David Sanchez (tomorrow and Sunday). Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge, $30 and $25 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    * TOM VARNER GROUP, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. Imagining yourself as a French horn player in jazz is half the battle; after that, original ideas about composition and material must come easily. Mr. Varner has distinguished himself in recent years by shifting around from brainy, Europeanish improv to the purely American repertory of country and gospel. Tonight he will play new compositions made possible by a grant from the Doris Duke Foundation, using his regular band of Steve Wilson and Tony Malaby on saxophones, Cameron Brown on bass and Tom Rainey on drums. Music starts tonight at 8:30; cover charge, $8 with a $6 minimum per set.  RATLIFF    * MIGUEL ZENON QUARTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. The young alto saxophonist Miguel Zenon is a burning player with an equally ferocious sense of organization. From his first album three years ago he seemed unusually evolved, with strong and light saxophone sound; his composing exhibits a broad intellect busily chewing up new jazz harmony and folkloric music of his native Puerto Rico, and now he has a strong working band (with Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass, Antonio Sanchez on drums). I've seen him twice in recent months and both shows were among the best I've seen all year. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission, $15 a set, $10 for members.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances:  nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'RODELINDA' Most of Handel's operas were introduced at the King's Theater in London, a house of 850 seats. But for its premiere production of Handel's ''Rodelinda,'' a musically rich and psychologically complex masterpiece, the Met proves that with the right approach and the right cast Handel can be presented effectively in a grand-size house. Renée Fleming brings her radiant voice and courageous vulnerability to her performance of the title character, the despairing queen of the Lombard king of Milan, Bertarido, who has been usurped and is thought dead. In tomorrow's performance the fine countertenor David Walker takes over the role of Bertarido from David Daniels. The refined tenor Kobie van Rensburg, the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe and the sweet-voiced countertenor Bejun Mehta are also excellent. The handsome production, directed by Stephen Wadsworth in his Met debut, sets the 7th-century story in early 18th-century Milan. Harry Bicket, also making his company debut, conducts with fleetness and assurance. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145 to $215.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'TANNHÄUSER' At 50, the German dramatic tenor Peter Seiffert, who has a major career in Europe, has finally made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the daunting title role of Wagner's ''Tannhäuser,'' a revival of Otto Schenk's handsomely realistic 1977 production. For Met fans it was worth the wait. Mr. Seiffert has all the power and stamina you could want from a Wagnerian tenor and, rarer, true tenorial colorings and impressive vocal agility. Though he has a barrel-chested physique, he gives a charismatic, physically nimble and sympathetic portrayal of the medieval knight and song minstrel torn between the erotic pleasures of Venus and the idealized love of Elisabeth. Singing her first Elisabeth at the Met, the dramatic soprano Deborah Voigt is in glorious voice. Michelle DeYoung makes a dusky-toned and alluring Venus. Thomas Hampson brings the elegance of the fine German lieder singer he is to his distinguished and vocally robust portrayal of Wolfram. Mark Elder conducts a lithe and vividly colored performance. Tomorrow afternoon at 1, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available.  TOMMASINI    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. This weekend the barge offers all six of Beethoven's early Opus 18 quartets: brilliant and austere works that announced Beethoven's genius in a genre that would become one of his most important. (Tonight features Nos. 1, 2 and 3; tomorrow and Sunday feature Nos. 4, 5 and 6.) The performers include the violinist Mark Peskanov, who is Bargemusic's artistic director, and Jonathan Gandelsman, an eloquent and charismatic young violinist who has appeared with Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $20.  JEREMY EICHLER    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER It has become the custom of the Chamber Music Society, and a handful of other ensembles, to walk through Bach's six ''Brandenburg'' Concertos every year during this holiday season. And why not? The society's players know them well and have given polished, vibrant traversals of the set. And listeners in search of a festive but nondenominational program could do worse than to spend a couple of hours with these pieces, in which Bach gives everyone -- violinists, flutists, trumpet players, harpsichordists and violas and cellists -- a share of the spotlight. Sunday at 5 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office.  ALLAN KOZINN    JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET For all the talk about classical music being elitist and expensive, there are affordable and even free classical music offerings in New York all the time, notably, the Peoples' Symphony Concerts. For its concert in this popular series tomorrow night the Juilliard Quartet plays three of the greatest string quartets: Haydn's Quartet in D, Op. 76, No. 5; Bartok's Third, the most experimental of the six Bartok quartets; and my favorite of Beethoven's three ''Rasoumovsky'' Quartets, Op. 59, No. 2, in E minor. Single tickets are just $9 -- cheaper than a movie. Tomorrow night at 8, Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680.  TOMMASINI    LIONHEART This vocal sextet, which specializes in medieval music (with periodic forays into contemporary works), and is presenting ''Tydyngs Trew,'' its program of carols, hymns and motets composed for the feasts surrounding Christmas in medieval England. The program begins with works commemorating the Feast of the Annunciation (on March 25), as well as several ancient Christmas carols. But it is not all seasonal cheeriness. Carols for the Feast of the Holy Innocents recall Herod's slaughter of children, and the colorful ''Seynt Thomas Honour We'' commemorates the murder of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, by King Henry II's knights on Dec. 29, 1170. If this isn't today's standard holiday fare, it offers an interesting glimpse into the traditions and attitudes of a distant era. Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290. Tickets: $35.  KOZINN    * MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE James Levine allows the extraordinary musicians of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra frequent forays into the spotlight, both as a full orchestra at Carnegie Hall and in chamber guises at Weill Recital Hall. The next installment of the chamber series is on Sunday, when the musicians perform Bach's Cantata No. 82 (''Ich habe genug''), Charles Wuorinen's ''New York Notes'' and the Schubert Octet. Mariusz Kwiecien is the baritone soloist in the Bach. Sunday at 5 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $92.  KOZINN    MUSICA SACRA If it's December, this must be ''Messiah.'' Richard Westenburg, Musica Sacra's music director, knows Handel's score as well as anyone, and some loyalists consider his annual performances, developed over four decades, the benchmark in the New York area. A performance a few years ago suggested that a certain routine may have taken hold, but the group should be on its mettle for its 40th-anniversary performance of the work. The vocal soloists are Rachel Rosales, Ryland Angel, James Archie Worley and Ryan McKinny. Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $110.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO The touring arm of the venerable Marlboro Music Festival makes regular appearances at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This weekend they come bearing arrangements of Bach's Trio Sonatas (BWV 529 and 530), Brahms's sumptuously voiced G-major string sextet, and a set of remarkable miniatures by the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag titled ''Signs, Games and Messages.'' The festival is known for its spirit of relaxed and spontaneous music-making, so one hopes the musicians will bring along a bit of that, too. Tonight at 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $35.  EICHLER    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson puts critics to the test because her great artistry is almost beyond description. It is hard to explain the effect of her richly colored and deeply expressive singing. For her New York Philharmonic debut, under the conductor Colin Davis, she sings Britten's dramatic cantata ''Phaedra,'' the composer's setting of Robert Lowell's translation of a Racine text, and an aria from Mozart's ''Clemenza di Tito.'' Sir Colin also conducts symphonies by Mozart (the ''Paris'') and Haydn (the ''Drumroll''), composers he has long conducted with elegance and vibrancy. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.  TOMMASINI    * 'UNSILENT NIGHT' This holiday tradition is part of the season regardless of the holiday you happen to celebrate. Held every year since 1992, Phil Kline's seasonal piece encompasses anyone willing to show up at the starting point, carry a boombox and wander through the East Village as part of an informal blocklong parade that spreads music in its wake (and accommodates whatever reaction it may elicit along the way). Since its inception ''Unsilent Night'' has spread to other cities and even other countries: Middlesborough, England, had its own last weekend. Saturday at 6:45 p.m., meeting at the arch in Washington Square and ending in Tompkins Square Park. Free; bring a boombox if you have one, though Mr. Kline usually brings several dozen for the occasion.  ANNE MIDGETTE    VIENNA CHOIR BOYS As the old millennium begins to fade into memory, few musical institutions can claim to have made their mark on more than half of it. Here is one, founded in 1498, renewed ever since and looking to span a new millennium. Kerem Sezen conducts the group in a holiday program. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $19 to $70.  OESTREICH    ANNE SOFIE VON OTTER She has done everything from ''Carmen'' to a recording with Elvis Costello; she has a great track record at finding interesting music that's fun; and she's versatile and popular enough to be an ideal choice for a holiday program with a certain je ne sais quoi. Or however you say that in Swedish, since Sweden is the home in this mezzo-soprano's ''Home for the Holidays'' program, for which she is bringing a small ensemble of musicians -- including an accordion and a guitar -- to Lincoln Center to play holiday favorites by everyone from Bach to Bohlin. Tomorrow night at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $50.  MIDGETTE    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances:  nytimes.com/dance.    ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER Smart, passionate and technically impressive, these Ailey dancers perform as if they believe in the power of communication. This weekend's highlights include the delectably sassy, bittersweet Ailey-Ellington ''Night Creature'' (tomorrow afternoon and evening), Ailey's impassioned ''Cry'' and the Donald McKayle classic ''Rainbow Round My Shoulder'' (both tomorrow night), and works by Ulysses Dove, Billy Wilson, Alonzo King and Ronald K. Brown. And Ailey's ''Revelations,'' of course, which ends the program tonight and the evening programs tomorrow and Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.alvinailey.org. Tickets: $25 to $110; $10 (cash only, at the box office) for Ailey DanceChance tickets on the day of performances Tuesday through Thursday nights and Sunday nights for students with identification). (Related review, Page 6.)  JENNIFER DUNNING    EGLEVSKY BALLET: 'THE NUTCRACKER' This production is a traditional one, choreographed by Ali Pourfarrokh, who directs the Eglevsky, Long Island's 43-year-old classical ballet troupe. Yes, there will be sugar plums, candy canes and dancing snowflakes, with not a finger-popping mouse in sight. Tomorrow at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 5 p.m. (and next Sunday at 2 p.m.), Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C.W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100. Tickets: $25 to $45; $22.50 to $40.50 for 65+.  DUNNING    YOSHIKO CHUMA: ''GAME/PLAY,'' Yoshiko Chuma has dancers and musicians from six countries play dozens of games ranging from innocent children's diversions to adult pastitmes like gambling. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, Upper East Side, (212 )517-2742. Tickets: $15.  JACK ANDERSON    MERCE CUNNINGHAM DANCE COMPANY The company creates theatrical kaleidoscopes in ''Events,'' performances in which new and existing choreography will be combined in a different way at each performance. And each performance will have different music and designs. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theatre, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42.  ANDERSON    THE KITCHEN: DANCE IN PROGRESS Choreographers, most of them new or little known, get together in this annual workshop to develop dances that they then perform. This year's artists are Erin Cornell, who dances with Jennifer Lacey and has performed with witty types like Sara Rudner and Cathy Weis, and Morgan Thorson, a Minneapolis-based choreographer who has worked with Jennifer Monson. Complete the trio is My Name & Company/Kepple + Osorio, a cooperative devoted to multimedia and performance work. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11. Tickets: $12.  DUNNING    BEN MUNISTERI DANCE PROJECTS The program includes sneak previews of work that will be performed next year at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and Central Park SummerStage. One of the new dances is set to music by Evren Celimli. Tonight through Sunday night at 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    NEW YORK CITY BALLET ''The Nutcracker'' is here. What more can be said? The company is performing George Balanchine's magical production of Tchaikovsky's fairy-tale ballet, complete with lovely snowflakes and sugarplums and malicious marauding mice. There's lots of sumptuous spectacle and delicious dancing. Tonight Peter Boal makes his debut as Herr Drosselmeier (a role he will repeat for a second and last time this season on Dec. 21). Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $26 to $96.  ANDERSON    NOA DANCE AND DANSCORES Nelly van Brummel, from France, describes her work, performed by her Noa Dance, as mixing subtle restraint and physical exhaustion. Sharing the program is Ofelia Loret de Mola, from Mexico, whose Danscores troupe will perform movement derived from improvisation and nervous impulses rather than conscious effort. Tonight at 9; tomorrow at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (347) 628-2160. Tickets: $15; $12 for students with identification.  DUNNING    DAVID PARKER Mr. Parker and his Bang Group arrive just in time to cure those seasonal ''Nutcracker'' blues. Their ''Nut/cracked'' is a sly, smart reinvention of the 19th-century classic. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25.  DUNNING    LIONEL POPKIN AND ANDY RUSS Mr. Popkin, a choreographer, and Mr. Russ collaborate on an evening of new works. Productions include a duet in which two people crawl over each other as they prepare a zucchini dish and a movement game for five people. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002 everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding its skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    * MARK DION: 'RESCUE ARCHAEOLOGY, A PROJECT FOR THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART,' the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through March 14. Mark Dion's installation piece is a site-specific faux archaeological-roots tour that resonates well with MoMA's historic reopening. Displaying detritus unearthed and salvaged during the renovation, it mixes bits and pieces of the Rockefeller brownstone that originally housed the museum on West 53rd Street with scraps of wallpaper from the recently demolished Dorset Hotel. The present's continual erasure of the past is poignantly illustrated, as is the rather startling contrast between the museum's modest beginnings with its current megacorporate dominance of the block. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  ROBERTA SMITH    * 'EAST VILLAGE USA,' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 219-1222 (through March 19). The roiling polymorphous East Village art scene of the 1980's comes to life in this fast-moving exhibition. Graffiti art, Neo-Expressionism, post-Conceptual political art and much more are touched on. The importance of punk, Warholian camp, hip-hop and longstanding local traditions of underground art and grass-roots activism is palpable in films, videos and photographs. And we are reminded that the scene was increasingly shadowed by the specter of AIDS and its own commercial success, which caused artists and dealers alike to decamp for SoHo. Also included is one great rediscovery, Frank Moore and Jim Self's 1985 film ''Beehive,'' a hilarious and beautiful ballet-in-an-installation. It shares a wall with a projection of Ethyl Eichelberger's 1986 ''Leer'' -- a revered one-man collision of Shakespeare and ''Gone With the Wind'' -- the high point of the show. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students and 65+  SMITH    * 'FORM FOLLOWS FASHION,' Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 217-7999, through Dec. 31. This ravishing show stresses fashion as a formal, abstract art, implicitly geometric, architectural, even in moments of excess. So it's not surprising in this context that formal also means evening wear, the genre in which garments are freed most decisively from function, or that couture gowns by designers from Charles James to Ralph Rucci enhanced by the invisible mannequins make this show a garden of unearthly capricious, silken delights. The art of the times is also startlingly palpable, notably in the pyramidal black-and-white gown that Michel Goma designed for Patou in the early 60's that is a near knockoff of a motif used by Myron Stout and Ellsworth Kelly. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, noon to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.  SMITH    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. There are problems with the new Museum of Modern Art, starting with its egregious $20 ticket price. The fairly inchoate assemblage of paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films from the last 30 years in the suite of double-height galleries for contemporary art on the second floor spells trouble, too. MoMA clearly still has to deal with the conflict between its historic authority when it comes to art of the first 60 or so years of the 20th century and the indeterminacy of its taste in recent art. But the building is exquisite, a great gift to the city, and you would have to be comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that MoMA virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., now retold in an installation that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. Hours and admission: see above.  KIMMELMAN    JENNIFER PASTOR: 'THE PERFECT RIDE,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (877) 944-8639, through Jan. 16. ''The Perfect Ride'' is a trio of works displayed in the Whitney's small first-floor gallery: a three-minute, slow-motion animated cartoon of a cowboy riding a bucking bull; a model of the human ear; and a large, semiabstract sculpture of aluminum and clear plastic that represents Hoover Dam. All involve the flow and circulation of energy, but beyond that it is hard to say what Ms. Pastor has in mind with this exceedingly cool and cerebral exhibition. Hours and admission: see above.  KEN JOHNSON    * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late-16th and early-17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner tools, barber instruments, farrier tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.  KIMMELMAN    * 'RETRATOS: 2,000 YEARS OF LATIN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through March 20. Two millenniums is a lot of terrain for even a survey cover, and this one moves from pre-Columbian sculpture to contemporary painting. But what is in between is so interesting and so unfamiliar that the trip is a pleasure. Art from the Spanish and Portuguese colonial era makes up the bulk of the work. It starts with a 16th-century portrait of three dark-skinned men, descendants of Indians and African slaves, wearing European ruffed collars, silks and distinctly un-European gold lip-rings and nose plugs. It continues with images of bewigged colonial officials, flower-crowned nuns and everyday people. The artists, whether trained in Europe or the New World, are as amazing as the faces they paint. Hours: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5, students and 65+; free for members; Thursdays free from 4 t 8 p.m.; 65+ free all day Thursdays.  COTTER    * 'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. Hmmm. Hours and admission: see above.  GRACE GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    'ART IN A MIRROR: COUNTERPROOFS OF MARY CASSATT,' Adelson Galleries, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 439-6870, through Jan. 14. These recently discovered counterproofs would seem to be of more interest to Cassatt scholars than to the general public. Like some of her Impressionist colleagues, Cassatt (1844-1926) made them by the simple method of pressing a damp sheet of paper on the face of existing work -- here, pastels -- transferring a mirror image of the original, but faded and softened. The 48 shown, sweet portraits of mothers with infants, children alone or posing with pets, pale by comparison with the sharp chromatics of Cassatt's wonderful prints.  GLUECK    RICHARD PETTIBONE, Leo Castelli, 18 East 77th Street, (212) 249-4470, through Thursday. Mr. Pettibone has forged a career by copying in miniature and with tenderly fastidious craft what other, more famous artists have done. This exhibition of paintings from 1964 to the present features hand-painted reproductions of Duchamp's ''Marie,'' Frank Stella's black pinstripe paintings and Roy Lichtenstein's image of a burning cigarette. There are surprises, too, like the baseball-card size, Photorealist portrait of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    * BILL BRANDT: 'THE NUDE: A CENTENARY EXHIBITION,' Edwynn Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 750-7070, through Jan. 8. Though he earned enormous respect as a photojournalist, making memorable studies of British life and class contrasts among other achievements, Brandt (1904-1983) liked to say that his photographs of nudes were the works by which he wanted to be remembered. This show pays tribute to his quirky, not conventionally erotic nude images from the early post-World War II days in which he photographed them melodramatically in dark, sparsely furnished interiors to later 1950's studies that were near abstractions. In these he closed in on parts, distorted or exaggerated by odd angles of focus and perspective and lighted for sharp contrasts of black and white. They often took on a surreally sensuous quality remote from everyday.  GLUECK    YOAN CAPOTE: 'ANIMICA,' George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665, through Dec. 30. Works by this Havana-based Surrealist include a suitcase containing a brick wall; a stack of concrete blocks separated by rows of clenched, polished bronze teeth called ''Stress''; a faux-classical Greek male torso with a brain replacing its genitalia; and real leather shoes that have weirdly merged at the toes.  JOHNSON    JULIO LARRAZ, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900, through Jan. 8. Mr. Larraz, who came to the United States from Cuba as a teenager in 1961, produces a generously painterly realism that often veers into surrealistic fantasy. His canvases record scenes of ordinary beauty, like the images of a melting block of ice or potted bougainvilleas for sale on a sunlighted boat deck. Then there is Vincent van Gogh visiting a modern aquarium in which a big shark hovers behind the thick glass.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    'EMOTICONS,' Guild & Greyshkul, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 625-9224, through Dec. 18. Referring to the shorthand symbols of feelings used by those adept at e-mail and text messaging, this title is somehow appropriate for this coolly elegant exhibition of two- and three-dimensional works by Dike Blaire, Jay Heikes, Jon Kessler, Julian Opie, Danica Phelps and seven others selected by Kevin Zucker. Carol Bove's record of a reading of ''The Future of Ecstasy,'' an essay by Allan Watts, is worth a listen for its fascinating recollection of 60's-style utopian psychology.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    LINDA BESEMER, Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 206-8710, through next Friday. Ms. Besemer's colorfully striped and gridded paintings consist of nothing but acrylic paint. Typically she has draped her smooth, rubbery sheets of paint over custom-made metal dowels, displaying them like bath mats at Ikea, but only one of her new works is on a rack. The others are attached flat to the wall, the better to show off visually ravishing layered grids distorted by illusionistic bulges.  JOHNSON    ODILI DONALD ODITA: 'NOTES FROM PARADISE,' Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Dec. 31. The Nigerian-born, Tallahassee-based Mr. Odita paints hard-edged, gridded, beautifully color-coordinated abstractions with intimations of landscape and African textile design. They are a pleasure to view, and the wedding of Modernism and traditionalism is something to ponder.  JOHNSON    ANDERS PETERSEN, Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363, through Dec. 31. Gritty, bleak and often darkly humorous black-and-white photographs by this Swedish photographer variously call to mind Robert Frank, Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin, but Mr. Petersen's work has its own raw pungency. This exhibition includes a series from 1978 documenting social life in a grungy bar; a series from 1995 shot in a psychiatric clinic; and recent diaristic works, often blurred and shot at oblique angles, recording what seems a life of volatile moodiness.  JOHNSON    JOEL-PETER WITKIN: 'HEART BEATS DUST,' Ricco-Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through Dec. 31. This pioneer of high-art, gross-out, postmodernist photography continues to produce faux-antique pictures of amputees, hermaphrodites, severed body parts and absurdly overwrought erotic tableaus. He has also ventured, unconvincingly, into Surrealistic collage, and he has applied paint by hand to some of his prints. A good title for this exhibition would be ''Lost in Transition.''  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    'FIGHT OR FLIGHT,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, (917) 663-2453. Through Feb. 18. Six artists were asked to make works about fear and anxiety. Excepting Rico Gatson's kaleidoscopic video punctuated by exploding bombs, none directly address war or terrorism. Amy Gartrell's psychedelic felt banners spoof self-affirmation mantras; Kristin Baker's semiabstract paintings evoke car crashes; and Marc Swanson's ship mast with a square sail of stitched-together T-shirts encourages a spirit of adventure. Little carnivorous horses graze on the flesh of a fallen dragon in Ivan Witenstein's large fantasy sculpture; and an installation by Wangechi Mutu stages a surrealistic shootout.  JOHNSON    'IN THIS PLACE,' Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473, through Jan. 22. This exhibition of photographs and videos by 15 artists includes works that evoke specific places, like Claudio Nolasco's street-level views of Williamsburg and Francesca Romeo's powerful video record of life in a Lower East Side bar. But too many others look like they could have been made just about anywhere -- Clifford Owens's sadomasochistic video performance piece set in an empty studio, for example -- and that undermines the thesis of the show's curator, Allen Frame.  JOHNSON    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE,' City Hall Park, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 14. Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style by this British artist include cartoon fashion models painted on freestanding sheets of glass; life-size enamel-on-steel representations of new cars; a quartet of playhouse-scale, 19th-century-style buildings of painted plywood entitled ''Village?''; and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    'CAST AND CARVED: AMERICAN SCULPTURE, 1850-1950,' Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, closing today. A century's worth of American sculpture, five tons of it, has been shoehorned into this town-house gallery, forming a wonderful mix of styles and movements whose examples range from first- to third-rate. Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Elie Nadelman, Alexander Calder and Isamu Noguchi are some of the starrier names. A browser's joy, the show offers a fine range of contrasts and comparisons as well as pure appreciations and a few surprises. For Western buffs, there's even a roomful of dashing bronzes by Frederic Remington, Charles Schreyvogel and James Earl Fraser.  GLUECK    GILBERT & GEORGE: 'PERVERSIVE PICTURES,' Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1018, and Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-2923., closing tomorrow. The British artists Gilbert and George have been such bad boys for such a long time that you figure they will eventually run out of steam. But they haven't yet on the evidence of a gratifyingly high-pitched two-gallery show that is set at just the right eye-splitting volume for a suddenly becalmed political atmosphere. The three-dozen new pieces spread over two galleries are digitally souped-up versions of the artists' customary multipanel photographic format.  COTTER    * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, closing tomorrow. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side.  SMITH    SHI CHONG: 'RADICAL REALISM,' Ethan Cohen, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, through Tuesday. Said to be one of China's leading Realist painters, Mr. Shi here presents two approaches to the female nude. Photorealist paintings of models who have been slathered in paste and have objects attached to them look so much like big photographs it is hard to believe they are handmade. Other paintings, apparently done from direct observation and made with a tender, slightly brushy touch, read as empathic meditations on the mortality of the flesh.  JOHNSON    LORI TASCHLER, JG Contemporary, 505 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 564-7662, closing tomorrow. Ms. Taschler's mysterious, sweetly melancholic paintings and pastels feature singular, emblematic objects or scenes: a simple house flanked by bare trees; an oven with its door invitingly open; a suspension bridge; a person sleeping with a cat on a sofa. Painted with faux-naïve simplicity and soft edges in shades of one or two muted colors, the images seem to emerge from dreams or transcendentalist reveries.  JOHNSON    '3 ATTEMPTS AT LONGEVITY,' Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, (212) 865-0783, closing on Sunday. ''Longevity'' here means extension not in time but in space. Each of three sculptors has created a work that is, like the gallery, 80-feet long. Karyn Olivier has piled all her winter clothes in the middle of a steel cable strung from one wall to the other; George Raggett has erected an orange plastic-and-metal construction fencing with sandbags, candles and little American flags near the middle commenting on contemporary desert warfare; and Isabel Riley has installed a series of colorful suspended yarn works and wooden structures resembling looms.

2," Sunday 12|12    CAROLS BY THE GARDEN  Cantori New York, a chamber choir, takes a break from 20th-century music to do an evening of traditional holiday fare. It's a great excuse to get into the lovely St. Luke's church, or to sneak around back to its semisecret garden. Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village; 5 p.m.; $15.    THE OPPOSITE OF PLEIN AIR  Sheri Warshauer paints pictures of wealthy people's apartments -- flat, color-rich, almost childish depictions that show a strong funny contrast between staid buildings and the funky art installed in them. The young Manhattan art collector Bill Previdi is among those paid this odd homage.  Jack the Pelican Presents, 487 Driggs Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; noon to 6 p.m.    ART IN ANOTHER VILLAGE  The season's foliage is all underfoot now, but it's still worth taking a trip to the town of North Adams, Mass. A new exhibition by Cai Guo-Qiang opens at the gigantic Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, or Mass MoCA, today; the centerpiece is a stop-motion tableau of nine cars flipping through the air, each supported by glass rods. Elsewhere in the building, photographs by Isabelle Hayeur prettify the town of North Adams itself: her digitally produced landscapes mix quaint postcardapproved scenes with trailers, factories and other signs of real life. Also on view: ''The Interventionists,'' a show of pranksters and fun politically motivated meddlers.  Mass MoCA, 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, Mass.; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; $10 general, free to members. Directions: www.massmoca.org.    Monday 12|13    GUIDANCE FOR THE HOLIDAYS  Manhattan User's Guide, whose free Web site that features daily tips for New Yorkers, will publish today ''50 Ways to End the Year,'' a special guide to 50 holiday events, with an emphasis on the arts. The site's taste ranges from the blessing of the animals at Central Presbyterian Church to the debut of a new print of Otto Preminger's ''Where the Sidewalk Ends.''  www.manhattanusersguide.com    CANADIAN SOCIAL SCENE  Broken Social Scene, a Canadian group, plays the first of three New York shows this week. Introspective without being narcissistic, it avoids the pitfalls of the emo crowd. And how many other pop bands include clarinets and trombones?  Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $20. (Also on Tuesday at Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan; 6:30 p.m., $42, and on Wednesday back at Bowery.)    CHRISTMAS WITH HARPSICHORD  Aulos Ensemble, a quintet devoted to original instrument performance, will be fittingly placed in the Medieval Sculpture Hall at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and joined by the baritone Sanford Sylvan in a performance of 16th- and 17th-century carols, including works by Rameau and Couperin. The museum's ornate miniature nativity scene in the hall dates from the 18th century -- slightly off-period, but we won't complain.  1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street; 6:30 and 8:30 p.m.; $60.    Tuesday 12|14    MERCE WITH KITES  Since 1964, Merce Cunningham's dance company has been performing ''Events'' -- programs that draw from the group's repertory but adapt it to the particular space in which they're being performed, the live music that accompanies them and even the audience that attends. Starting tonight, six ''Events'' will also interact with the work of contemporary visual artists. The first night, it's Jacqueline Matisse Monnier, a French sculptor whose work is obsessed with kites, so expect intrusions into the audience's air space. On Wednesday, it's the installation artist Robert Gober.  Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea; 7:30 p.m.; $42. (Through next Sunday.)    SCORSESE TALKS  ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' is a loving, 90-minute profile of perhaps the New Yorkiest of directors. The showing tonight, a world premiere, will be bookended with Mr. Scorsese's ''Last Waltz'' (1978) at 8 p.m., and ''Raging Bull'' (1980) at 11:30 p.m. and ''New York, New York'' (1977) at 3:30 a.m.Turner Classic Movies, 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.    DVD'S THIS WEEK: 'PARIS, TEXAS'  Today's the last gasp of the stocking-stuffer DVD releases: ''I, Robot'' hits stores (Fox Home Entertainment, $29.98), as does a repackaged ''Lord of the Rings'' ''extended edition,'' for those for whom the original seemed somehow too short (New Line Home Entertainment, $119.97 for a whopping 12 discs). ''Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica, the First Season'' (Paramount Home Video, $26.99) fits onto a comparatively slender two-DVD set. Wim Wenders's 1984 film ''Paris, Texas'' (Fox Home Entertainment, $9.98) has never been released on DVD; today, that awful oversight is corrected.    NOT HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS  Three writers read fiction for a program called ''Home and Other Dislocations,'' among them Lynne Tillman, whose dark work is the perfect solace for the holiday-dispossessed.  Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, Lower East Side; 7 p.m.; $5.    Wednesday 12|15    PAUL MOONEY ON BROADWAY  The comedian Paul Mooney is a frequent guest on Comedy Central's ''Chappelle's Show''; behind the scenes he's written for Richard Pryor, ''In Living Color'' and ''Saturday Night Live.'' His appearances at Caroline's are when he works out his best new bits.  Caroline's on Broadway, 1626 Broadway, at 50th Street; 10 p.m.; $20.50. (Also Friday through next Sunday.)    A JAZZY NUTCRACKER  ''Nut/Cracked'' is -- please forgive -- ''The Nutcracker'' on crack: jazz settings of Tchaikovsky's score allow David Parker and the Bang Group to engage in high-dance comedy. Tonight's opening will be followed by a talk with Mr. Parker, the choreographer.  Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 7:30 p.m.; $20; $12 for members. (Through Dec. 22.)    REJECTS  Each month, ''The Rejection Show'' invites writers and artists to present works that have been refused publication. Tonight, the New Yorker cartoonists David Sipress and Matt Diffee will present some of their killed drawings; the event's curator, Jon Friedman, will show ''Santa Claus and the Jew,'' his short film about a trip down the wrong chimney that was rejected by the Sundance festival. And the writer Jonathan Ames will kvetch about his own repudiations.  P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village; 8 p.m.; $7.    Thursday 12|16    CD'S THIS WEEK: ASHANTI  Ashanti, who represents the sweeter, more R&B-inflected side of the family formerly known as Murder Inc., releases ''Concrete Rose'' ($13.98, Def Jam); Funkadelic's too-trippy ''Cosmic Funkers'' (Atom, $24.99 gets a domestic rerelease; and Synthphony, a New York-based electronica label, puts out ''Synthphony REMIXed!,'' by the German D.J. Harald Schoger. (Synthphony, $14).    PLAIN JANE  The songwriter Jane Siberry was an indie-pop secret in the late 80's who won a devoted following as she reinvented the sort of mysterious, allusive music Kate Bush pioneered. Ms. Siberry alienated some of her fans in the 90's, when she took a slight turn into New Age. Tonight the spiritually inclined and deeply earnest Ms. Siberry plays the second of three intimate nights at Joe's Pub.  425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; 7 p.m.; $25. (Also Wednesday and Friday.)    DUELING SCROOGES  You've got at least three productions of ''A Christmas Carol'' to choose from. Tickets remain for only a few hourlong performances at the Auditorium at Equitable, while over at the 13th Street Repertory Company, an abundance of tickets remain for its 90-minute performance. The best bargain, with tickets still available, is the Personal Space Theatrics production at the Bernie West Theater -- though with 22 songs it runs to a full two hours.  Theatreworks/USA, Auditorium at Equitable. 787 Seventh Avenue, between 51th and 52nd Streets; $25. 13th Street Rep, 50 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village; 7 p.m., $12 to $15. Personal Space Theatrics, Bernie West Theater, 17 Lexington Avenue, between 22nd and 23rd Streets ; 8 p.m.; $10 to $15.    Friday 12|17    HIGH SCHOOL STORY  Yes, it's a high school musical production. But it's La Guardia High School, the alma mater of Isaac Mizrahi and Jennifer Aniston, with the school's 45-member orchestra accompanying the appropriately aged cast members in ''West Side Story.'' Gang war in a Manhattan school never looked so professional.  La Guardia Concert Hall, Amsterdam Avenue at 65th Street; 7:30 p.m.; $10 to $15. (Also on Saturday.)    MOVIES THIS WEEKEND: A SEA OF FILM  Dive in: In the wake of Wes Anderson's ''Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,'' the weekend is awash in biography-based, nautically titled films. But ''The Sea Inside,'' the story of a quadriplegic who fought for the right to die, should absolutely not be confused with ''Beyond the Sea,'' the sanitized Bobby Darin biopic. In limited release, ''Open My Heart,'' an Italian film about a prostitute and her possessive sister, opens at the Quad Cinema tonight. Tim Burton's ''Nightmare Before Christmas'' (1993) plays at the Sunshine Cinema at midnight tonight and tomorrow night -- nice timing, as its influence on the current ''Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'' is palpable.    A DANCE SURPRISE  For the last two months, a group of young choreographers have workshopped together; tonight, they'll make their experiments -- which are still being poked and prodded -- public for the Kitchen's Dance in Progress performance. Chosen by the curator and choreographer Sarah Michelson, the performers will reflect her taste in always vigorous, sometimes rude, and often cinematic dance.  The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 8 p.m.; $12. (Also on Saturday.)    TRIAL PERFORMANCE  Phoenix Theater Ensemble -- created in September by five members of the Jean Cocteau Repertory, a small company devoted to classics, -- introduces its first production tonight, André Gide and Jean-Louis Barrault's adaptation of Kafka's ''Trial.'' There have been no fussy present-day updatings, no write-ins of Johnnie Cochran as the persecuted character K.'s lawyer: just the pure, mazey nightmare of Kafka.  The Mint Space, 311 West 43rd Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Jan. 9.)    Saturday 12|18    LAST CHANCE FOR LOVE  ''Freestyle Love Supreme,'' a 60-minute live music, comedy, hip-hop amalgamation, stars six men in their mid-20's, professionals in the art of free-style rhyme. Its host, Anthony Veneziale, is a whirling comic M.C. who manages to involve the audience without humiliating them. Freestyle closes its run of frantic improvisations tonight.  Ars Nova Theater, 511 West 54th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $20.    BURNING MAN  The photographer Gabe Kirchheimer brings a bit of heat to winter with his documentation of Burning Man, the wild festival that takes place each summer in the Nevada desert. The one-night exhibition takes place nightclub-style, with wine and live music, and is a benefit for Art Start, which conducts the Arts in the Shelters program, intended to build self-esteem, teach expression and provide mentoring for homeless youth in New York City.  20 Greene Street, SoHo; 7:30 p.m. to 1 a.m.; $30 suggested donation.    KID FRIENDLY PLAY  ''Extraordinary,'' a 60-minute show geared to the demanding 2-12 set, opens today. It's the sweet story of a boy and his deaf cousin who go in search of her hearing in the Land of Quiet. So sweet! Also this weekend: an adaptation of ''Puss in Boots,'' starring a talking cat who helps his owner, a knight, win the heart of a princess of the castle. The children's tales, with their white-knight gender roles, might seem a bit dated -- but hey, they've got a talking cat!  ''Extraordinary'': Vital Theater Company at the McGinn Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street; 1 and 3 p.m.; $15. (Through Feb 6.)''Puss in Boots'': John Houseman Studio Theater, 452 West 42nd Street; 2 and 8 p.m.; $25. (Through next Sunday.)

It was nearly half a century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.   BEN BRANTLEY    * 'DEMOCRACY.' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.    BRANTLEY    + 'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays that chronicles the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is over 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.   BRANTLEY    + 'THE GOOD BODY' In her tremendously popular ''Vagina Monologues,'' Eve Ensler exposed the connections between taboos about the discussion of female sexuality and women's oppression. Ms. Ensler has now moved on -- to her belly button. Ms. Ensler wants to soften the ever-fraught relationship between American women and their bodies. In between reflections on her own uncertain journey toward finding the beauty in imperfection, Ms. Ensler offers the perspectives of women she turned to for enlightenment. But the stylish can't obscure the fact that Ms. Ensler's new material is less compelling than the ''Vagina'' testimonials. Truly fresh insights are in short supply (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $81.25; a limited number of $26.25 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the performance.   CHARLES ISHERWOOD    + ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother.'' Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these two first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25.    BRANTLEY    + 'PACIFIC OVERTURES' The director Amon Miyamoto dazzled New Yorkers at the Lincoln Center Festival two years ago with his visiting Japanese-language production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's 1976 musical about American gunboat diplomacy as visited on 19th-century Japan. Now Mr. Miyamoto has revisited the show with an English-speaking, predominantly Asian-American cast, including B. D. Wong as the wryly omniscient narrator. The show's scenic and conceptual elements are essentially the same. But something has definitely been lost in the retranslation. The production does give beguiling due to Mr. Sondheim's silken, silvery score. But an uneasy tentativeness pervades the stage like a mist of perspiration (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Curtain at 7 p.m. from Dec. 14-23. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25.    BRANTLEY    * 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.    BRANTLEY    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing show-off and soft-hearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house in Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25.    BRANTLEY    + 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she's met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. The movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago, the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49, Ms. Goldberg is now an established performer, and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen different characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25.    ISHERWOOD    Off Broadway    ++ 'THE BALTIMORE WALTZ' Paula Vogel is indisputably the author of ''The Baltimore Waltz,'' but a decade of collective grief, rage and confusion surely played a part in its authorship, too. Ms. Vogel began work on the play shortly after her brother's death from AIDS in 1988. It was a deeply personal, even idiosyncratic expression of sorrow and love. But in the dozen years since its premiere at Circle Repertory, emotion surrounding the AIDS epidemic has inevitably cooled, and the play now must stand up to less emotionally inflected scrutiny. Sadly, on the evidence of Mark Brokaw's smart but dry production, the second in the Signature Theaters season devoted to Ms. Vogel's work, it mostly sags. This is partly due to a crucial piece of miscasting. Kristen Johnston is a talented actress, but she doesnt do poignancy convincingly. She makes all the right noises, but the submerged emotional charge that should bind together the jumbled comic gambits of Ms. Vogel's comedy never fully emerges (1:25). Signature's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, (212)244-7529. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.   ISHERWOOD    'BELLE ÉPOQUE' The époque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle Époque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $70.    ISHERWOOD    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.   BRANTLEY    'THE FOREIGNER' Matthew Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There's no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.    BRANTLEY    *+ 'GUANTÁNAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: you are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario is the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. This calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60.   BRANTLEY    +'MODERN ORTHODOX' It is said that God works in mysterious ways. Daniel Goldfarb's new play suggests He is not above employing obnoxious ones, too. In this snappy if superficial romantic comedy with a glossy cast (Molly Ringwald, Jason Biggs and Craig Bierko), Hannah and Ben, a young Jewish couple comfortably ensconced on Manhattan's Upper West Side, are provoked to question their commitment to each other -- and the depth of their religious feeling -- when Hershel Klein, an ill-mannered interloper from another borough and another sect arrives on their doorstep, demanding to be given harbor. Since the abrasive behavior of Hershel, played by Mr. Biggs, tends to indicate colossal bad manners more powerfully than spiritual enlightenment, the character's deployment as a catalyst is more than a little specious. But the soul-searching is primarily filler supplementing Mr. Goldfarb's bright comic swipes at intra-faith cultural clashes. The gags may be parceled out with the mechanical rhythms of a sitcom script, but they are often sharp and punchy (1:30). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46 to $66.   ISHERWOOD    * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1900. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.   ISHERWOOD    * 'RODNEY'S WIFE' Seemingly light conversation scrapes the skins of the characters in Richard Nelson's sharply etched study of dislocation, loneliness and sexual betrayal, directed by the playwright and and starring David Strathairn as a fading American movie star working in Rome. And you are always aware of the strain and snappishness that arises when people politely avoid saying what is on everyone's mind. Long before the unspoken is brought out for airing, Mr. Nelson and his fine cast have created a full emotional geography of a family, replete with deserts and bogs and patches of quicksand. Though the play, which traces the conflicts among the women in the life of Mr. Strathairn's alcoholic character, is centered on what movie ads used to call an ''illicit passion,'' there is nothing prurient about this production. What it offers instead is a deep and sorrowful understanding of how much loneliness there often is in lust (1:45). Playwrights Horizons Mainstage Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.   BRANTLEY    'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Amid the pervasive aura of doom, Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors, who include Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos'' and a particularly fine Beth Fowler, provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences before our eyes, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60.   ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    'PEOPLE ARE WRONG!' A Manhattan couple seeking relief from city stress find country living more treacherous than expected in this good-natured but ragged rock musical at the Vineyard Theater, a co-production with the Target Margin Theater. A lively young cast infuses the proceedings with comic high spirits even when the musical begins to spin its wheels, or spin out of control. John Flansburgh, one-half of the popular rock duo They Might Be Giants, makes his Off-Broadway debut as one of the luckless country weekenders. Unfortunately, once the musical has established the simple story line (crazy gardener screws up wedding plans) and put across its sardonic tone, it begins to disintegrate, even as the song list stretches past the horizon (there are 30 tunes). A few songs stand out for their satiric content for instance, a giddy duet celebrating a much-coveted wedding planner but too many are devoted to embroidering the sillier aspects of the plot. Still, the performers hold your attention even when you give up on the musical (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 5 and 9 p.m. Tickets: $55.   ISHERWOOD    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'AFTER MIDNIGHT' Starring Giorgio Pasotti and Francesca Inaudi. Directed by Davide Ferrario (not rated, 89 minutes; in Italian, with English subtitles). This whimsical romantic comedy served with a heaping tablespoon of sugar is drenched in even more esoteric movie lore than that sentimental Italian crowd-pleaser ''Cinema Paradiso.'' Its poker-faced protagonist, Martino (Mr. Pasotti), is a wistful sad-eyed hermit who works as the custodian of Italy's National Museum of Cinema in Turin. Inside this solitary twilight world, he lives and works surrounded by old movie reels, vintage cameras and projectors. He is abruptly drawn out of his shell when a beautiful woman (Ms. Inaudi) on the run from the law seeks asylum in the museum. Depending on your tolerance for incessant movie references you may find ''After Midnight'' endearing or cloying.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'AFTER THE SUNSET' Starring Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Brett Ratner (PG-13, 93 minutes). You'd have to search high and low to find screen lovers with less romantic chemistry than Mr. Brosnan and Ms. Hayek in ''After the Sunset,'' a jewel-heist frolic so stale it feels like a retread of a retread. Mr. Brosnan has finally reached the age of flab, and the sight of Ms. Hayek's extravagant cleavage spilling over his hairy paunch isn't especially pretty. Even by the fanciful rules of caper comedies, ''After the Sunset'' is a fraudulent entertainment. Except for the opening chase, its action sequences are strictly routine, and the overall tone strains after a wit and style that appear far beyond the director's grasp.  HOLDEN    'ALEXANDER' Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 173 minutes). There comes the moment in the career of many directors when they are compelled to tell the story of a great man in whose life they seem to see a glimmer of their own image. Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson each had Jesus. Now, Oliver Stone has Alexander the Great, the Macedonian tyrant who cut a bloody swath through the ancient world to no obvious end other than, if Mr. Stone's big, blowsy movie is to believed, to get away from his kvetch of a mother. Olympias, played with nose-flaring gusto by Ms. Jolie, was the mother of all monstrous mothers, a literal snake charmer whose love for her only son had the stench of incestuous passion. For Alexander (Mr. Farrell, upstaged by an epically bad dye job), the oedipal plot would only thicken because he also loved Olympias's most loathed enemy, her husband and his father, Philip, the King of Macedon (Mr. Kilmer). The struggle between Olympias and Philip, these primordial warring female and male forces, would be reproduced in both Alexander's bisexual desires and his rapacious conquest of the feminized East. In other words, Alexander became his dad to waylay his mom.   MANOHLA DARGIS    * 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael García Bernal, Fele Martínez and Javier Cámara. Directed by Pedro Almodóvar (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The great Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless film makers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almodóvar, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grace of ''Bad Education'' is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling itself and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual. HOLDEN    'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair, the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core. But she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.   A. O. SCOTT    'BIRTH' Starring Nicole Kidman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer (R, 100 minutes). A metaphysical puzzle -- part ghost story, part melodrama -- in which Ms. Kidman plays Anna, a wealthy Manhattan widow, who meets a young boy claiming to be her dead husband. The premise is strange, almost preposterous, but Mr. Glazer presents it with a hushed, solemn intensity that keeps you in a state of pleasurable disorientation. The screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière wrote many scripts for Luis Buñuel, and there is an element of arch surrealism in this tale, which might be cold and mechanical were it not for Ms. Kidman's performance.   SCOTT    'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off again. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of both charm and obvious intelligence? Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck.    DARGIS     'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy. The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community.HOLDEN    'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction both improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play and exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The actors all work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen, raw, brash and witty, succeeds.    SCOTT    'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan'' has been revisited numerous times. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. The film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote.   DARGIS    *  'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS' Starring Zhang Ziyi. Directed by Zhang Yimou (PG-13, 119 minutes; in Mandarin, with English subtitles). In the latest chapter of Mr. Zhang's triumphant reinvention as an action filmmaker, Ms. Zhang plays Mei, a blind courtesan who turns out to be a member of the Flying Daggers, a shadowy squad of assassins waging a guerrilla insurgency against the corrupt and decadent government. She is pursued by two government deputies, Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), whose loyalties come into question as the chase turns into a love triangle. Everyone is engaged in several layers of deceit, and some of the third-act revelations are more likely to provoke laughter than gasps of amazement. But realism is as irrelevant a criterion here as it would be in an Italian opera. The movie is about color, kineticism and the kind of heavy-breathing, decorous sensuality that went out of American movies when sexual candor came in. Though it is in constant, breathtaking motion, the picture is not especially moving. Unlike the greatest operas (in whatever medium), it inspires you to gasp, but not to weep.   SCOTT     * 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes try to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced them into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Mr. Bird uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world where ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology and trades in its subtlety for noise and over-familiar thrills.   SCOTT     *  'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost naïve belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging his personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight.   SCOTT    'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year-old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine.   HOLDEN    'THE POLAR EXPRESS' With the voices of Tom Hanks, Michael Jeter, Peter Scolare, Nona Gaye, Eddie Deezen and Charles Fleischer. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (G, 97 minutes). Based on the 32-page children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, this new animated feature has received attention for the advanced technology employed to make the film and the heart-skipping amount of money reportedly spent to transpose the story from page to screen. I suspect that most moviegoers care more about stories and characters than how much money it took for a digitally rendered strand of hair to flutter persuasively in the wind. Nor will they care that to make ''Polar Express'' Mr. Hanks wore a little cap that transmitted a record of his movements to a computer, creating templates for five different animated characters. It's likely, I imagine, that most moviegoers will be more concerned by the eerie listlessness of those characters' faces and the grim vision of Santa Claus's North Pole compound.   DARGIS    'PURPLE BUTTERFLY' Starring Zhang Ziyi and Toru Nakamura. Directed by Lou Ye (R, 127 minutes; in Mandarin, Japanese, Vietnamese and Cantonese, with English subtitles). Like his first movie, ''Suzhou River,'' Mr. Lou's new one takes place in Shanghai, and is redolent with that city's smoky, romantic atmosphere. This time, rather than updating film noir conventions, the director goes back in time, to the 1930's, when Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese. The film unfolds at the intersection of political intrigue and sighing romance. Ms. Zhang plays Cynthia, who is inolved with a clandestine militant group plotting against the Japanese. Her former lover Itami (Mr. Nakamura) is a Japanese intelligence officer intent on destroying her group. The story's many twists and coincidences are handled almost casually, and the movie's atmosphere of melancholy elegance nearly overwhelms both its emotions and its political themes. It is nonetheless a haunting entertainment, and the work of a director with an impressive sense of style.   SCOTT    * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future. DARGIS    'THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE' With the voices of Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and Rodger Bumpass. Directed by Steven Hillenburg (PG, 88 minutes). If nautical nonsense be something you wish for, then this big-screen expansion of the popular Nickelodeon show will be just the ticket. SpongeBob and his best pal Patrick set off on a rambling quest to recover a stolen crown and prevent Plankton from taking over Bikini Bottom and driving poor Mr. Krabs out of business. If none of this makes sense to you, fear not; it won't necessarily make any more after the movie is done. In any case, the point of ''SpongeBob'' is not sense but nonsense, and the film, like the series, is a giddy celebration of pure childishness, which makes it a refreshing antidote to the glowering machismo that dominates so much pop culture.   SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tatou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young solider fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to do them part, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes   DARGIS    Rock/Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * BLACK KAT VS. ONE LOVE HI PAWA, The Rock, 1219 Rockaway Avenue, at Foster Avenue, Canarsie, Brooklyn, (917) 312-2044; www.dancehallreggae.com.. A reggae soundclash, where teams of D.J.'s compete to see who has the best and most obscure records -- they often rely on specially commissioned one-of-a-kind ''dubplates.'' Sounds pretty straightforward, but these nights often veer toward exhilarating chaos: records get played in five-second snippets, hypemen taunt their opponents, bloodthirsty fans search for any excuse to scream -- or, almost as often, to boo. Tomorrow night is an international grudge match: Black Kat, from Jamaica, takes on One Love Hi Pawa, an Italian crew that seeks to overcome its geographical disadvantage through clever selection (One Love began one recent clash by playing the theme from ''The Godfather'') and sheer pluck. Tomorrow night after 10; admission, $25 in advance, $30 tomorrow.  KELEFA SANNEH    BOY GEORGE, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780. A dance party led by the new-wave veteran Boy George, who long ago reinvented himself as a celebrity D.J. Don't go expecting to hear golden oldies: his frenetic, slightly playful sets draw heavily from house music and gesture occasionally toward the synthetic sound of electro; you may be surprised to find out how serious he is about making people dance. Here's hoping the dancers are just as serious; on his Web site, he complained about one recent New York gig, writing, ''If an audience ain't 'Up 4 it,' there's not much I can do.'' Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 at the door.   SANNEH     BOYZ II MEN, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. In the 1990's, back when boy bands were singers above all, close a capella harmonies and sinuous, Stevie Wonder-style lead vocals made million-sellers of Boyz II Men. Sunday night at 7, with Keyshia Cole opening; tickets are $40.   JON PARELES    * CANDIDO AND GRACIELA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155. Latin music revolutionized New York swing and jazz in the 1940's. Candido, an improvising powerhouse on conga drums, and Graciela, who sang with Machito and His Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, were on the scene then and recently made a new album together, ''Inolvidable'' (Chesky). Tomorrow night at 8 and 10; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 at the door, with a one-drink minimum.    PARELES    CHER/VILLAGE PEOPLE, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000. Cher hung in on the pop charts from 1960's folk-rock to 1990's dance pop, and she has never stinted on spectacle. This is her latest farewell tour. The Village People were a disco pageant of gay male archetypes whose songwriters came up with durable anthems like ''Y.M.C.A.'' and ''Macho Man.'' Sunday night at 7; tickets are $35.25 to $128.25.   PARELES    DARK STAR ORCHESTRA, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. The Dark Star Orchestra is a Dead Head jam band that takes its repertory seriously. It doesn't just play the songs; it recreates full-length Dead sets as played (and bootlegged) from long ago. Tonight at 8; tickets are $18.   PARELES    DIKKI DU AND THE ZYDECO CREW, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155. Dikki Du is Troy Carriere, who comes from an accordion-playing Louisiana family that also includes his brother Chubby and his father Roy. He's gone into the family business, leading a zydeco band that adds some funk to the two-steps. The group is presented by Let's Zydeco (www.letszydeco.com), which offers a dance workshop before the live music starts. Sunday night at 7:30; admission is $15, with a one-drink minimum.   PARELES    * RICHARD FEARLESS, the Music Gallery, 49 Ann Street, 2nd Floor, near Nassau Street, Lower Manhattan, www  .enablernetwork.org. This producer, from the sometimes-rowdy, sometimes-bleary, sometimes-both electronica act Death in Vegas, is to play a DJ set at a party devoted to acid house, Detroit techno, Miami bass, ''Italo-space-disco'' and other dancefloor-friendly forms of machine music; it should be a long, raucous night. Tomorrow night at 10, with JDH, Cowboy Mark and Paradoxx; admission is $6.   SANNEH    HOWARD FISHMAN, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Howard Fishman has been poking around America's musical basements and attics., looking for droll insights. His group can riffle back through the decades, all the way back to the 1930's, without getting stuck in revivialism. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $12, with a two-drink minimum.    PARELES    DICK FOX'S HOLIDAY ROOTS OF ROCK, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800.

Lars Frederiksen is a member of Rancid. With his other band, the Bastards, he plays straightforward, old-fashioned buzzsaw punk: fast, loud and fascinated by mayhem. Roger Miret and the Disasters share the bill. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $15.   PARELES    LES GEORGES LENINGRAD, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. This willfully ridiculous Montreal band makes a clangy, often propulsive racket, drawing inspiration from the dissonant dance music that came clattering out of New York's no-wave scene a quarter-century ago. Tonight at 9, with COMA. and the Frequency; tickets are $10.   SANNEH    IAN HUNTER, the Stone Pony, 913 Ocean Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732) 502-0600; the Downtown, 190 Main Street, Farmingdale, N.Y., (516) 293-7700; B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Ian Hunter led Mott the Hoople, an English band that deserves to be remembered for more than the band's hit, ''All the Young Dudes.'' In his own songs, he tinctured the yearning and posturing of glam with some of Bob Dylan's earthiness. His latest band, the Rant, includes James Mastro from the Bongos on guitar and Graham Maby, from the Joe Jackson Band, on bass. At the Stone Pony in Asbury Park tonight at 8; tickets are $20. At the Downtown tomorrow night at 7:30, with Soozie Tyrell opening; tickets are $22 to $40, with a seated two-drink minimum and a one-drink minimum at the bar. At B.B.

PARELES    IVY QUEEN, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-2672. Reggaeton, the Puerto Rican hybrid of hip-hop and dancehall, is as much a male bastion as hip-hop, but one proud exception is Ivy Queen, who's as tough and articulate as her male counterparts. Tonight at 10; admission is $30 for men, $15 for women, $10 for members.    PARELES    * KHONNOR, the Tank, 432 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 563-6269. This young singer-songwriter and noise-collagist is responsible for one of the year's most pleasant surprises, a hazy, homemade-sounding album called, ''Handwriting'' (Type), which places his half-whispered confessions (or, sometimes, jokes) over and under and alongside engrossing electronic textures. Khonnor is to headline the Transelectronic Winter Festival, a promising laptop-centric night co-starring RJ Valeo, Goldmund, Praveen and the D.J. Michael Venezia. (Visit www.transelectronic.org for more information.) Tomorrow night at 9; admission is $7.   SANNEH    MEMPHIS, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com. Early next year, the lovely (but sometimes vicious) Canadian indie-pop group Stars is to release an American version of its enthralling new album, 'Set Yourself on Fire.' Fans who can't wait can visit Rothko tomorrow night, where Stars' playfully petulant frontman, Torquil Campbell, is to perform with Chris Dumont: they call themselves Memphis, and the duo recently released a casual and often charming debut album, ''I Dreamed We Fell Apart'' (Paper Bag). There's only one Pet Shop Boys cover (''Love Comes Quickly''), but you might swear you hear more. Tomorrow night at 11, with Andrew Kenny, from the hypnotic indie-rock minimalists American Analog Set; tickets are $8.   SANNEH    * NEULANDER, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com. Earlier this year, this appealing electro-pop duo released ''Smoke + Fire'' (Disko B), full of gleaming, precise pop songs built from the least possible number of electronic sounds; at its best, the music evokes both the monomaniacal meticulousness of minimal electronica and the slick nonchalance of mainstream new wave. Tonight at 10, with Snaz, from the self-consciously sleazy post-disco duo Captain Comatose, as well as DJ Unkown, Plexus, Dan Selzer, Lisa (Bubbles) Hsu, and others; tickets are $8 in advance, $12 at the door.   SANNEH    RADIO 4, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. Radio 4, part of New York City's rock renaissaince, looks back to the early 1980's, when punk, funk and politics added up to potent dance music with a conscience. Tonight at 8, with the Occasion and French Toast opening; admission is $10.   PARELES    * JOSH RITTER/OLLABELLE, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The old folkie staples -- a guitar, a gruff voice, a good eye -- still work for John Ritter, a young songwriter who finds extravagant romance in the everyday. Ollabelle is a group that reaches back to rural gospel and blues for songs like ''John the Revelator'' and ''Elijah Rock,'' setting out to modernize them without losing the spirit. Tonight, Mr. Ritter at 10:30, Ollabelle at 9:30 and Willy Mason at 8:30; admission is $16.   PARELES    DUKE ROBILLARD, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155. Duke Robillard is a guitarist and a suave singer whose blues lore goes back to the swing and jump-band blues he used to play with Roomful of Blues. Lately, he has backed Bob Dylan in the studio. Tonight at 7:30; admission is $22, with a one-drink minimum.   PARELES    ROMEIKO ENSEMBLE, St. Mary's Times Square, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 545-7536. This 22-member ensemble of singers and musicians from Turkey, Greece and the United States performs ancient Byzantine chants, the stately court music of Constantinople and mystical Sufi music from the Ottoman Empire. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30.    PARELES    * NICKY SIANO, APT, 419 West 13th Street, near Washington Street, the Meatpacking District, (212) 414-4245. There's only one problem with ''The Gallery: The Original New York Disco 1973-77'' (Soul Jazz), a new compilation by this pioneering D.J.: it's a grab bag, not a nonstop mix. Still, the tracks are predictably excellent (prepare to be floored -- not for the first time, perhaps -- by the Pointer Sisters' slow-motion strut, ''Yes We Can Can''), and there probably won't be any complaints when Mr. Siano celebrates the CD at APT, the cramped nightclub (it's more like a bar) that still books better dance D.J.'s than any space in the city. Tomorrow night at 9, with Citizen Kane; admission is $8.   SANNEH    UMPHREY'S MCGEE, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Umphrey's McGee has been moving up the jam-band circuit with its melding of the Dead and the Allman Brothers along with streaks of jazz and funk. Tonight at 8; tickets are $18.50.    PARELES    MAX WEINBERG 7, B .B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The house band from Late Night With Conan O'Brien, led by the drummer from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, is a tightly arranged jump band. Onstage, it proves it can play not just mid-show snippets but full-length songs. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $30, with a $10 food or drink minimum.   PARELES    KELLER WILLIAMS, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. The guitarist and singer Keller Williams has been working the jam-band circuit, using loop and echo effects he turns his 10-stringed guitar into a full band. His mild voice has more than a touch of James Taylor, but his fast fingers delight the kind of fan one of his songs describes as a ''Freaker by the Speaker.'' Tonight, doors open at 6:30; admission is $20.    PARELES    Z-100 JINGLE BALL, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. Pop 2004 is on display at this radio-station extravaganza, which tosses together rhythm-and-blues, pop and rock. Performers include Destiny's Child, Ashlee Simpson, Kelly Clarkson, Good Charlotte, Maroon 5, Ryan Cabrera, Vanessa Carlton and others. Tickets are $25 to $230.    PARELES    JOHN ZORN'S MASADA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. John Zorn wrote Masada, a book of 100 klezmer-flavored tunes, back in 1994, and various ensembles have brought out their jazz and chamber-music sides. This September and October, he multipled his Masada repertory, adding a Book Two of 240 tunes. He will introduce them this weekend with musicians including Jamie Saft (keyboard), Ben Perowsky (drums), Erik Friedlander (cello), Ikue Mori (drum machine/power book), Dave Douglas (trumpet), Marc Ribot (guitar), Cyro Baptista (percussion), Sylvie Courvoisier (piano), Greg Cohen (bass), Trevor Dunn (bass), Shanir Blumenkranz (bass), Jon Madof (guitar) and Mathias Kunzli (drums). Tonight and tomorrow at 8 and 10 p.m., $20.   PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.   STEPHEN HOLDEN    BABY JANE DEXTER, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609. Ms. Dexter, a natural rock-blues belter who refrains from full-tilt shouting, roams all over the place, from Cole Porter to R.E.M. to Rod McKuen to the Rolling Stones, in her new show ''Bread and Gravy.'' If her bold re-evaluations of songs don't always work, they tear away the associations crusted on songs we think we know to reveal new avenues of interpretation. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:15. Cover: $25 and a $15 minimum.   HOLDEN    * ANDREA MARCOVICCI, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Authentic glamour may be an oxymoron. But Ms. Marcovicci becomes its embodiment when she performs. In her new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire,'' she suggests a latter-day hybrid of Audrey Hepburn, the most gracious, elegant and beautifully spoken of Hollywood princesses, and Mabel Mercer, that ruefully witty, all-wise, healing muse of a thousand romantic sorrows. Like Mercer's, her singing is really speech-song executed with an elocutionary flourish and stylized acting. The show weaves music, biography and analysis of Astaire iconography into a definitive career summary. It focuses, in particular, on his relationships with the composers who wrote for him. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $60, with a $55 dinner required at the early shows and a $20 minimum at the late shows.   HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative, and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $40.   HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95.   HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    WILLIAM ASH TRIO, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-6056. On ''The Phoenix,'' his new album on Smalls Jazz, the young guitarist William Ash is a hard-core classicist with a hard, biting, slightly reverby sound; it's a satisfying record, and Mr. Ash has been a comfortable fixture at Smalls and, later, at Fat Cat, for quite a while. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; cover charge is $15.    BEN RATLIFF    BILL BRUFORD/TIM GARLAND EARTHWORKS UNDERGROUND, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. Since the late 80's, Bill Bruford, a technique-heavy drummer who used to play with King Crimson, has set progressive rock aside and explored jazz in looser and looser contexts; here he and the British saxophonist Tim Garland perform with a group of Americans including the saxophonists Chris Karlick and Steve Wilson, the trumpeters Alex Spiagin and Tony Kadleck, the trombonist Rock Cicarone, the pianist Henry Hey and the bassist Mike Pope. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $32.50 plus a $10 minimum.    RATLIFF    * DON BYRON QUARTET, Whitney Museum, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, Upper East Side, 1-800-WHITNEY. It's not one of Mr. Byron's high-concept working bands, and not tied to a new record; it's just a one-off gig by the resourceful clarinetist with some of his longest-running colleagues since he came to New York in the early 80's. The band includes the guitarist Bill Frisell, the bassist Kermit Driscoll and the drummer Pheeroan AkLaff. Tonight at 7; admission is free or pay what you wish.    RATLIFF    ORRIN EVANS QUARTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. From Philadelphia, where so many good young jazz players seem to originate these days, the pianist Orrin Evans is a ball of energy, determined to outdo the Miles Davis quintet of the 1960's in terms of a concept of controlled freedom on the bandstand. His band members can seem as if they are just following their instincts, but at a subtle cue they snap into a piece of composed material. He's always bringing new people into his sphere, and the shows can get happily raucous; the band this weekend includes the saxophonist Sam Newsome, the bassist Madison Rast, the drummer Donald Edwards and the vocalist JD Walter. Sets are tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.    RATLIFF    * BILL FRISELL QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. You have to give it to Bill Frisell for the long haul: having come out of the fairly fragmentary downtown music scene of the 1980's, he is still building an audience and working on his own ideal music, sometimes gentle or earthy Americana, sometimes harmonically complex, and unarguably jazz. He can also, on occasion, make your jaw drop with his guitar playing. This group augments his regular trio (including the bassist Tony Scherr and the drummer Kenny Wolleson) with new textures: the soft-toned trumpeter Ron Miles and the tenor saxophonist Greg Tardy. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tomorrow; cover charge is $20 with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    LOUIS HAYES-BUSTER WILLIAMS QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. Louis Hayes, the drummer, has a hard, straightforward groove with an inimitable cymbal beat; he played on all sorts of important hard-bop records in the 1960's, and keeps an especially strong rhythmic connection with the bassist Buster Williams. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20 with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    BRIAN LYNCH'S SPHERES OF INFLUENCE, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. With a recent Doris Duke Foundation grant, Brian. Lynch wrote new music for his band Spheres of Influence, expanding the group in the process; it's now a nonet, with some of the most exciting musicians in the new Latin-jazz scene including the saxophonist Miguel Zenon, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the percussionist Pedro Martinez. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 with a $10 minimum.    RATLIFF     BILL MAYS TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. A gifted and under-recognized pianist who has been making records since the 1970's, Bill Mays makes attractive, witty and highly jazz-literate trio music with his band, including Martin Wind on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:45 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday with a $10 minimum both days.   RATLIFF     JOHN McNEIL'S INSOMNIA BAND, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. A composer of humor and intelligence, the trumpeter John McNeil has played a secondary role as a longtime sideman and educator. But he's stepping out more as a bandleader: Omnitone records recently released ''Sleep Won't Come,'' and this gig will present some of the music on the record. Tonight at 8:30; admission is $10 with a one-drink minimum.   RATLIFF     * ARTURO O'FARRILL AND RIZA NEGRA, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212) 581-3080. Mr. O'Farrill, son of the composer and arranger Chico O'Farrill, came into his father's band through the piano chair and now, since the father's death, has become its boss; more recently he became leader of Lincoln Center's impressive new Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra. This band includes some of the best musicians in town: the saxophonist Joe Lovano, the clarinetist and saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera, the vibraphonist Dave Samuels, the trumpeter Tom Harrell, the bassist John Benitez and the drummer Dafnis Prieto. Tonight at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 with a $10 minimum.    RATLIFF     CECIL PAYNE BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212) 885-7119. Cecil Payne, a venerable jazz musician who was in Dizzy Gillespie's big band in the 1940's, hasn't stopped playing gigs; he's still a man of extremes, playing the baritone saxophone and the flute. With him to celebrate his 82nd birthday are the bassist David Williams, the trombonist Steve Davis, the drummer Joe Farnsworth and (tonight only) the great pianist Barry Harris. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15 with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF     * GONZALO RUBALCABA QUARTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, 5th Floor, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. The Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba used to make cold, fast and technical fusion music, but by the late 1990's, he had begun to make warmer, fascinatingly slow jazz. ''Paseo,'' his new album on Blue Note, with a new Cuban quartet, lands somewhere in between. The music is by turns fussy and elegant -- in both tortoise and hare tempos -- but Mr. Rubalcaba's improvised single-note lines, with lots of built-in space, are like commands from a great height. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30; cover charge is $30 with a $10 minimum at a table and a $5 minimum at the bar.   RATLIFF     McCOY TYNER TRIO, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. The pianist McCoy Tyner is one of the living mainlines of jazz, the definer of modern jazz harmony, the course that developing players must pass. He's worth hearing in performance; he is still the music's deepest colorist and gets a great, thunderous ring from his instrument. This week he takes a break from his regular working trio to play with two of the flashier musicians to come along in jazz's last 40 years: the bassist Stanley Clarke and the drummer Billy Cobham. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $45 with a $5 minimum.   RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'LES CONTES D'HOFFMANN' Offenbach's final opera, and his masterpiece, ''Les Contes d'Hoffmann,'' is often performed with one soprano singing the three leading soprano roles in the three flashback tales the opera tells, and one bass taking all four villain roles. For the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Otto Schenk's striking production from 1982, the Met is dividing the female leads among three sopranos: Aleksandra Kurzak as Olympia, Hei-Kyung Hong as Antonia and Béatrice Uria-Monzon as Giulietta. The veteran bass James Morris, however, will take on all four villains. But attention will very likely be focused on the tenor Ramón Vargas, who sings the daunting title role. Frédéric Chaslin, so impressive in the recent revival of Verdi's ''Vespri Siciliani,'' conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $215.    ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'I VESPRI SICILIANI' The convoluted story and clunky libretto to Verdi's ''Vespri Siciliani'' has probably kept this mature and stirring opera from gaining repertory status. So it's good to have this work back at the Met after 22 years, a revival of John Dexter's grimly abstract 1974 production. In the impassioned and stylish performance by the conductor Frédéric Chaslin, ''I Vespri Siciliani'' emerges as a musically distinguished opera that, with its French inflections, anticipates Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlos.'' Don't fret if the story, based on the 1282 uprising and massacre by the people of Palermo, Sicily, against their hated French occupiers, seems implausible. Just let yourself get swept away by the music. The cast includes the husky-voiced (and husky-framed) tenor Francisco Casanova, the elegant baritone Leo Nucci and the stentorian bass Samuel Ramey and, best of all, the compelling soprano Sondra Radvanovsky as Elena, one of Verdi's great heroines. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.   TOMMASINI    * 'RODELINDA' Most of Handel's operas were introduced at the King's Theater in London, a house of 850 seats. But for its premiere production of ''Rodelinda,'' a musically rich and psychologically complex masterpiece, the Met proves that with the right approach and the right cast Handel can be presented effectively in a grand-size house. Renée Fleming brings a radiant voice and courageous vulnerability to her performance of the title character, the despairing queen of the Lombard king of Milan, who has been usurped and is thought dead, portrayed by the entrancing countertenor David Daniels, who gives a vocally poignant, virile and virtuosic portrayal. The refined tenor Kobie van Rensburg, the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, the sweet-voiced countertenor Bejun Mehta and the strapping bass-baritone John Relyea are also excellent. The handsome production, which sets the 7th-century story in 18th-century Milan, is directed imaginatively by Stephen Wadsworth in his overdue debut with the company. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available.   TOMMASINI    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight Inna Faliks, a young Ukrainian-born pianist, offers music by Chopin, Schumann and Brahms. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon will be family concerts -- not for the audience per se but onstage as the Juilliard Quartet's violist, Samuel Rhodes, is joined by his wife, Hiroko Yajima (violin), and his daughter, Harumi Rhodes (violin). Marcy Rosen, the cellist of the Mendelssohn Quartet, rounds out the ensemble for works by Mozart, Schumann and Schoenberg. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $25.   JEREMY EICHLER    BEAUX-ARTS TRIO This piano trio celebrates its 50th anniversary this season, and while the string players have come and gone through the years, the group's founding pianist, Menahem Pressler, has stayed in one place. His current youthful colleagues are the violinist Daniel Hope and the cellist Antonio Meneses, both stylish and capable players, and the ensemble mix is a happy one. Tonight, the group's all-Beethoven series continues with the Seven Variations (for cello) on Mozart's ''Bei Männern, welche Liebe fühlen,'' from ''Die Zauberflöte''; the Violin Sonata in C minor (Op. 30, No. 2); and the Trio in E flat (Op. 1, No. 1). Tonight at 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $45.   EICHLER    * COUNTER)INDUCTION This ensemble's inventive programs and virtuosic performances have made it an important force in the new music world in recent seasons. For its concert at Scandinavia House, the group is offering works by Finnish composers. Two are well-known here: Magnus Lindberg, who is represented by ''Tre Stycken Till Esa-Pekka Salonen'' (''Three Pieces for Esa-Pekka Salonen''), is known for his rugged and imaginative scoring, and Kaija Saariaho, whose ''Oi Kuu'' will be heard, is renowned for her fresh use of color and structure. Also on the program are works by Jukka Tiensuu, Fridrich Bruk, Osmo Tapio Raihala, Tomi Raisanen and Sampo Haapamaki. Tonight at 8, Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, near 37th Street, (212) 847-9740. Tickets: $15.  ALLAN KOZINN    DAEDALUS QUARTET Formed four years ago at the Marlboro festival, this young string quartet has already made considerable progress, including its selection to participate in Rising Stars, a series in which Carnegie Hall and several European halls jointly present debuts by promising soloists and chamber groups. Daedalus makes its Weill Recital Hall debut as part of the series tonight, with a program that includes Haydn's Quartet in E flat (Op. 20, No. 1), Beethoven's ''Harp'' Quartet in E flat (Op. 74) and Elliott Carter's Quartet No. 5, the last as a tribute to Mr. Carter on the eve of his 96th birthday. Tonight at 7:30, Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $24.   KOZINN    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK Frederick Renz's period instrument ensemble usually looks back to Medieval dramas or Renaissance carols for its annual Christmas programs. This year, the group is offering a more new-fangled program, ''Colonial Christmas,'' which looks at 18th-century music that was played or sung in the decades surrounding the American Revolution. Included are choral anthems and dance pieces for flute, violin and bass, a popular chamber combination in colonial times. Sunday at 3 p.m., the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330. Sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office, for $35. The program is also repeated weekends through Dec. 26.   KOZINN    EMERSON STRING QUARTET WORKSHOP ENSEMBLES Intensive chamber music seminars can often push a young ensemble to the next level, and this week, four such groups have been given extensive coaching by the veteran members of the Emerson String Quartet. The focus has been quintets by Brahms and Dvorak, and this Sunday afternoon, the participants will show off what they've learned. First up (at 1 p.m.) will be the Stony Brook String Quartet playing Brahms's G-major Viola Quintet (Op. 111) followed by the Setla Quartet performing Dvorak's A-major Piano Quintet (Op. 81). At 4, the Fountain Ensemble plays Brahms's Clarinet Quintet followed by the Salinger String Quartet with Dvorak's E-flat Viola Quintet (Op. 97). Various guest artists join at each performance. Sunday at 1 and 4 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $15 for each concert.    EICHLER    'L'ENFANCE DU CHRIST' An envelope-pusher in every respect, Hector Berlioz developed a form of dramatic oratorio with an almost novelistic movement of scenes and focuses that makes staging extremely difficult. ''L'Enfance du Christ,'' a glowing, monumental, three-part recounting of the birth of Christ, will get royal treatment in a one-off presentation by Dicapo Opera, emerging from underground into the church that shelters it, with Johannes Somary leading his Amor Artis ensemble and the excellent mezzo-soprano Maria Zifchak. Tomorrow night at 8, St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438. Tickets: $47.50.    ANNE MIDGETTE    GUARNERI STRING QUARTET All four of the Guarneri's founding members will perform together this weekend as the original cellist, David Soyer, returns to the group as a guest artist in Dvorak's String Sextet. (Ida Kavafian will also be joining on viola.) Besides the Dvorak and Mozart's Adagio and Fugue in C minor, the program also includes Viktor Ullmann's seldom-heard String Quartet No. 3. The Guarneri's energy seemed to flag when I heard them earlier this season, but perhaps the reunion of old colleagues as well as the unusual repertory will give this concert a boost. Tomorrow night at 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $45.   EICHLER    HANDEL'S 'MESSIAH' The venerable Masterwork Chorus was the first I heard perform ''Messiah'' in New York, in the early 1970's. David Randolph conducted, trying, if memory serves, to miniaturize huge forces in a wan nod to the early-music movement, which was then gathering steam. (Mr. Randolph is conducting the St. Cecilia Chorus and Orchestra in Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'' at Carnegie Hall tonight at 8.) In 1999 Mr. Randolph's successor, David Briskin, bade the Masterwork Chorus farewell with a tighter, more coherent effort: one of the better ''Messiah'' performances of that season. The group is now directed by Andrew Megill, whom I have not heard in the work, but there is every reason to believe that he is tending well to the legacy. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. and Dec. 23 at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: afternoon, $20 to $75; evenings, $20 to $100.   JAMES R. OESTREICH    MONTEVERDI VESPERS Nicholas White, the director of music at St. Michael's Church, has been beefing up the program in recent years, and here he sets his forces a real test: Monteverdi's grand and sonorous sacred work of 1610. Mr. White conducts the St. Michael's Choir, the Tiffany Consort and the Spiritus Collective. For anyone ''Messiah''-ed out, this is a powerfully attractive alternative. Sunday at 7 p.m., St. Michael's Church, Amsterdam Avenue at 99th Street, (212) 222-2700, ext. 24. Tickets: $30 and $50; $20 and $40 for students and 62+.   OESTREICH    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Sibelius and Elgar have long been high on the list of Sir Colin Davis's specialities, and works of theirs -- Sibelius's ''En Saga'' and the Elgar Violin Concerto -- will open and close his program when he takes the New York Philharmonic on a short trip to the Tilles Center tonight. He is joined in the Elgar by Hilary Hahn, a young soloist who recently released a thoughtful, energetic recording of the work on the Deutsche Grammophon label. Between the Sibelius and the Elgar, Sir Colin leads Janacek's ''Taras Bulba.'' Tonight at 8, the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100. Tickets: $50 to $100. Tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.   KOZINN    BARBARA QUINTILIANI AND KERI ALKEMA The Marilyn Horne Foundation makes a specialty of presenting promising young singers, and Sunday afternoon's duo are particularly worth watching. Ms. Quintiliani, who won the Metropolitan Opera auditions in 1999, has a round, lovely soprano; Ms. Alkema, a darkish mezzo, has made a good impression in past Horne Foundation concerts. The two join in songs and duets with Craig Terry at the piano. Sunday afternoon at 3, St. Bartholemew's Church, Park Avenue at 51st Street, (212) 378-0248. Tickets: $20, $15 for 65+, free for students.   MIDGETTE    'SIREN SONGS' The title track of this concert of the new-music collective Ensemble 21 is by Eric Moe, one of two featured composers on a program devoted to piano and voice. The pianist is the excellent Marilyn Nonken, who will play Mr. Moe's ''Pulaski Skyway Waltz,'' Jason Eckardt's ''Echoes' White Veil,'' which she's recorded, and other works; the mezzo-soprano Mary Nessinger will join her for ''Siren Songs'' and George Crumb's luminous night-evoking cycle ''Apparitions.'' Tonight at 8, CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, (212) 817-8215. Tickets: $15, $10 for students.    MIDGETTE    TALLIS SCHOLARS Renaissance vocal music wasn't a particularly big deal in 1973, and if it is now it's partly because the Tallis Scholars, founded in that year, have helped to make it so. Tonight the group, conducted by its founder, Peter Phillips, presents a holiday program centered around Palestrina's Christmas mass ''O magnum mysterium,'' with other music by de Lassus, Isaac de Rore, Appenzeller and Zielinski. Tonight at 8, Low Library Rotunda, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Sold out, but tickets may be available at the box office.

Full reviews of recent dance performances:  nytimes.com/dance.    * ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER Smart, passionate and technically impressive, these Ailey dancers perform as if they believe in the importance of communication with their audiences. Highlights of this weekend's programs include Ailey's sly and shimmering ''Night Creature,'' which perfectly captures the Ellington score's wistful insouciance (tonight); Ronald K. Brown's impassioned ''Grace'' (tomorrow afternoon); Ailey's tender-hearted ''Memoria,'' whose surge of Ailey student dancers toward the end is a guaranteed eye-moistener, and Billy Wilson's sunny and saucy ''Winter in Lisbon'' (both Sunday night). In addition to other Ailey works, the programs include dances by Elisa Monte and David Parsons (tonight, in a program accompanied by live music), and Donald Byrd and Judith Jamison with Rennie Harris and Robert Battle (tomorrow night). Ailey's ''Revelations'' will end the program tonight and at the matinees. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.alvinailey.org. Tickets: $25 to $110; $10 (cash only, at the box office) for Ailey DanceChance tickets on the day of performances Tuesday through Thursday night and Sunday nights for students with identification.    JENNIFER DUNNING    CONTEMPORARY BALLET THEATER This troupe, directed by Pepper and based in the burgeoning South Bronx art-center known as BAAD!, will present its own version of ''The Nutcracker.'' Tonight's performance is a gala benefit honoring Louis Johnson, Arthur Mitchell, Bill T. Jones and Bill Aguado, with Virginia Johnson as host. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture, 450 Grand Concourse near East 149th Street, Mott Haven, Bronx, (718) 518-4455. Tickets: $12 for adults; $7 for children; $100 for gala benefit and reception tonight.    DUNNING    DANCES PATRELLE Francis Patrelle's ''Yorkville Nutcracker'' moves the familiar scenario to late 19th-century New York City. Adult and student dancers from Mr. Patrelle's company will be joined at various performances by guest artists Jenifer Ringer and James Fayette from the New York City Ballet, Sandra Brown of American Ballet Theater, Donald Williams of Dance Theater of Harlem and Jonathan Porretta, a whizkid from Pacific Northwest Ballet. Tonight at 6; tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m. and Sunday at 1 and 6 p.m., Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, East 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, Manhattan, (212)  772-4448. Tickets: $40; $30 for 65+.  DUNNING    * DE FACTO DANCE This weekend's wild-card program is by an improvisational modern-dance troupe that describes its repertory as ''anti dances'' that search for new choreographic structures predicated on creative rules of the pioneering Doris Humphrey, which include ''don't just do something, stand there!'' The program includes a reworking of Richard Bull's ''Radio Dances.'' Tonight through Sunday night at 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, near Houston Street, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 65+.   DUNNING    'FLAMENCO FIESTA' Andrea del Conte Danza España and the guest artists Oscar Valero and José Junco celebrate the company's 25th anniversary in a theater whose intimacy approximates a prime condition for viewing this age-old dance form. Today at 2 and 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+.    DUNNING    MARIA HASSABI ''Dead Is Dead'' is filled with references to pop culture. Yet this work for six dancers with music by Spencer Sweeney also tries to discover the quietness that may be embedded in the chaos and randomness of our lives. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $20.    JACK ANDERSON    GUTA HEDEWIG In ''Menagerie,'' this German-born choreographer casts an observant and irreverent human gaze on the quirky behavior of birds and beasts. Original music by Edward Ratliff will be performed live by the Sirius String Quartet. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday nights at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.    ANDERSON    THE KITCHEN: DANCE IN PROGRESS In this project, choreographers create together, sharing feedback, in a two-month workshop. This season's artists are Erin Cornell, Morgan Thorson and the Kepple-Osorio My Name & Company multimedia group. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, between 10th and 11th Streets, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11. Tickets: $12.    DUNNING    MARYMOUNT MANHATTAN DANCE This program by student dancers includes new pieces by Bahiyah Sayyed-Gaines and Denise Vale, two powerful performers whose take on choreography might be interesting. The program also includes works by Francisca Martinez, Elizabeth Higgins and Pat Dougherty. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Theresa Lang Theater, 221 East 71st Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 517-0610. Tickets: $12; $8 for students and 65+.   DUNNING    ALONA MOR DANCE COLLECTIVE Ms. Mor, from Israel but now based in New York City, will present her new ''Return, Unchanged,'' which tells the story in modern dance of a young woman who returns home after a self-imposed exile and finds that everything and nothing have changed. The cast will include teen-age performers from two city community centers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 and 9; Sunday at 3 and 8 p.m, Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, Manhattan, (917) 756-3847. Tickets: $15.    DUNNING    * MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP The company, beloved for its mix of traditional dance forms and everydaydance moves and for a repertory of musically sensitive dance, will perform Mr. Morris's ''Gloria'' and the New York premiere of ''All Fours.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, N.Y., (518) 299-3100. Tickets: $42 to $65; $39 to $62.   DUNNING    NEW YORK CITY BALLET ''The Nutcracker'' is here. What more needs to be said? The company is performing George Balanchine's magical production of Tchaikovsky's fairy-tale ballet, complete with lovely snowflakes and sugarplums and malicious marauding mice. There's lots of sumptuous spectacle and delicious dancing. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $26 to $96.    ANDERSON    NEW YORK THEATER FESTIVAL Less is not necessarily more, but this venerable troupe has acquired a reputation for presenting one-hour versions of classics. This month's ballet of choice is a version of ''The Nutcracker'' by Keith Michael. Tomorrow and Sunday (and next Saturday and Sunday) at 11 a.m. and 1 and 3:30 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160. Tickets: $30 for adults; $25 for children 12 and under.   DUNNING    * NEXT WAVE FESTIVAL: JOHN JASPERSE Known for his brainy exploration of space and expectation, Mr. Jasperse will present his new full-evening ''California,'' danced to music by Jonathan Bepler, performed live. The piece, which reflects on the state itself, probes what should be done when things don't turn out as hoped. Sounds decidedly timely, at least for resolutely blue staters. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $45.   DUNNING    NUDANCENOW A showcase for new choreography presents works by Alpha Omega Dance Theater, Earl Mosley's Diversity of Dance, La Manga, Erica Essner Performance Co-op, Balance Dance Theater and DecaDance. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Theater of the Riverside Church, 91 Claremont Avenue, Morningside Heights, (212) 870-6784. Tickets: $15.   ANDERSON    TERE O'CONNOR DANCE Mr. O'Connor's new ''Frozen Mommy'' juxtaposes disparate types of movement to take viewers on an enigmatic journey through the terrors of the world. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. No matinee tomorrow. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793. Tickets: $20.    ANDERSON    JEANETTE STONER DANCE AND THEATER Ms. Stoner, a former Alwin Nikolais dancer, is known for her blending of movement and the spoken word. She will present two new pieces, ''Mary and Parkay,'' an absurdist dance drama, and ''Dark Dances,'' a piece about hidden fears that was inspired by images by artists who include Blake and Goya. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 5 p.m., Loft at 83 Leonard Street, five blocks south of Canal Street between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 228-1576. Tickets: $12.    DUNNING    * SUNDAYS @ THREE: CHRIS ELAM This series offers a chance to see new work and talk with the choreographer afterward. The intriguingly gnomic Mr. Elam, one of the most individualistic of modern-dance voices today, will present ''Dedos de Caracol'' (''Toes of a Snail''). Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, Lexington Avenue and 92nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $10.   DUNNING    VINCENT VERBURG Mr. Verburg, a Dutch choreographer who lived in New York shortly before and after the September 11 attacks, will present ''In Between Spaces,'' a multimedia dance piece that explores facets of the event. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10; Sunday at 5:30 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street west of Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $15.    DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.   MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.    HOLLAND COTTER    * MARK DION: 'RESCUE ARCHECOLOGY, A PROJECT FOR THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART,' the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through March 14. Mark Dion's installation piece, commissioned by the museum four years ago, is a site-specific faux-archeological roots tour that resonates well with the Modern's historic reopening. Displaying detritus unearthed and salvaged during the renovation , it work mixes together bits and pieces of the Rockefeller brownstone that originally housed the museum on West 53rd Street with scraps of wallpaper from the recently demised Dorset Hotel. The presents continual erasure of the past is poignantly illustrated, as is the rather startling contrast the museums modest beginnings with its current mega-corporate dominance of the block. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.    ROBERTA SMITH     * 'FORM FOLLOWS FASHION,' Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street (212) 217-7999, through Dec. 31. This ravishing show stresses fashion as a formal, abstract art, implicitly geometric, architectural, even in moments of excess. So its not surprising in this context formal also means evening wear, the genre in which garments are freed most decisively from function, or that couture gowns by designers from Charles James to Ralph Rucci enhanced by the invisible mannequins make this show a garden of unearthly capricious, silken delights. The art of the times is also startlingly palpable, notably in the pyramidal black and white gown that Michel Goma designed for Patou in the early 60's, which is a near knockoff of a motif used by Myron Stout and Ellsworth Kelly. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays noon to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.    SMITH    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. There are problems with the new Museum of Modern Art, starting with its egregious $20 ticket price. The fairly inchoate assemblage of paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films from the last 30 years in the suite of double-height galleries for contemporary art on the second floor spells trouble, too. The Modern clearly still has to deal with the conflict between its historic authority when it comes to art of the first 60 or so years of the 20th century and the indeterminacy of its taste in recent art. But the building is exquisite, a great gift to the city, and you would have to be either comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that the Modern virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., now retold in an installation that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. Hours and admission: see above.   KIMMELMAN    JENNIFER PASTOR: 'THE PERFECT RIDE,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (877) 944-8639, through Jan. 16. ''The Perfect Ride'' is a trio of works displayed in the Whitney's small, first-floor gallery: a three-minute, slow-motion animated cartoon of a cowboy riding a bucking bull; a model of the human ear; and a large, semi-abstract sculpture of aluminum and clear plastic that represents Hoover Dam. All three involved the flow and circulation of energy, but beyond that it is hard to say what Ms. Pastor has in mind with this exceedingly cool and cerebral exhibition. Hours and admission: see above.   KEN JOHNSON     * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.    KIMMELMAN    * 'RETRATOS: 2,000 YEARS OF LATIN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, through March 20. Two milleniums is a lot of terrain for even a survey cover, and this one moves from preColumbian sculpture to contemporary painting. But what's in between is so interesting, and so unfamiliar, that the trip is a pleasure. Art from the Spanish and Portuguese colonial era makes up the bulk of the work. It starts with a 16th-century portrait of three dark-skinned men, descendants of Indians and African slaves, wearing European ruffed collars silks and distinctly un-European gold lip-rings and nose plugs, and continues with images of bewigged colonial officials, flower-crowned nuns, and everyday people. The artists, whether trained in Europe or in the New World, are as amazing as the faces they paint. Hours: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5, students and 65+; free for members; Thursdays free from 4 t 8 p.m.; 65+ free all day Thursdays.   COTTER    Galleries: Uptown    'ART IN A MIRROR: COUNTERPROOFS OF MARY CASSATT,' Adelson Galleries, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 439-6870, through Jan. 14. These recently discovered counterproofs would seem to be of more interest to Cassatt scholars than to the general public. Like some of her Impressionist colleagues, Cassatt (1844-1926) made them by the simple method of pressing a damp sheet of paper on the face of existing work -- here, pastels -- transferring a mirror image of the original but faded and softened. The 48 shown, sweet portraits of mothers with infants, children alone or posing with pets, pale by comparison with the sharp chromatics of Cassatts wonderful prints.    GRACE GLUECK    'CAST AND CARVED: AMERICAN SCULPTURE 1850-1950,' Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, through Dec. 17. A century's worth of American sculpture, five tons of it, has been shoehorned into this town-house gallery, forming a wonderful mix of styles and movements whose examples range from first- to third-rate. Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Elie Nadelman, Alexander Calder and Isamu Noguchi are some of the starrier names. A browser's joy, the show offers a fine range of contrasts and comparisons as well as pure appreciations and a few surprises. For Western buffs, there's even a roomful of dashing bronzes by Frederic Remington, Charles Schreyvogel and James Earl Fraser.    GLUECK    'CHASE INSIDE AND OUT: THE AESTHETIC INTERIORS OF WILLIAM MERRITT CHASE,' Berry-Hill Galleries, 11 East 70th Street, (212) 744-2300, through Jan 29. When the spirit moved him, William Merritt Chase (1849-1916), a fluent painter perhaps best appreciated for his outdoor scenes, could easily switch to interiors. His indoor subjects were most apt to be studio glimpses, still lifes and figure compositions involving his large and exuberant family. This show of more than 30 paintings, a robust salute to his bravura brushmanship, claims to be the first devoted to the artist's indoor compositions, although several very appealing outdoor scenes are also displayed. Delighting in rich materials and polished surfaces, he used as props for his paintings the exotic stuff that packed his studio: textiles, carpets, pots, costumes, musical instruments and such. This show confirms his own dictum, that to bring about a successful work of art, ''the subject must have been well-seen by the painter.''     GLUECK    '3 ATTEMPTS AT LONGEVITY,' Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, (212) 865-0783, through Dec. 19. ''Longevity'' here means extension not in time but in space. Each of three sculptors has created a work that is, like the gallery itself, 80-feet long. Karyn Olivier has piled all her winter clothes in the middle of a steel cable strung from one wall to the other; George Raggett has erected an orange plastic and metal construction fencing with sandbags, candles and little American flags near the middle commenting on contemporary desert warfare; and Isabel Riley has installed a series of colorful suspended yarn works and wooden structures resembling looms.   JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    'EMOTICONS,' Guild & Greyshkul, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 625-9224, through Dec. 18. Referring to the to shorthand symbols of feelings used by e-mail- and text-messaging adepts, the title is somehow appropriate for this coolly elegant exhibition of two- and three-dimensional works by Dike Blaire, Jay Heikes, Jon Kessler, Julian Opie, Danica Phelps and seven others selected by Kevin Zucker. Carol Bove's record of a reading of ''The Future of Ecstasy,'' an essay by Allan Watts, is worth a listen for its fascinating recollection of 60's-style utopian psychology.   JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    LINDA BESEMER, Cohan and Leslie, 138 Tenth Avenue at 18th Street, (212) 206-8710, through Dec. 24. Ms. Besemer's colorfully striped and gridded paintings consist of nothing but acrylic paint. Typically she has draped her smooth, rubbery sheets of paint over custom-made metal dowels, displaying them like bath mats at Ikea, but only one of Ms. Besemer's new works is on a rack. The others are attached flat to the wall, the better to show off visually ravishing layered grids distorted by illusionistic bulges.    JOHNSON    GILBERT & GEORGE: 'PERVERSIVE PICTURES,' Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018 and Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2923., through Dec. 18. These British artists Gilbert and George have been such bad boys for such a long time that you figure they'll eventually run out of steam. But they haven't yet on the evidence of a gratifyingly high-pitched two-gallery show that is set at just the right eye-splitting volume for a suddenly becalmed political atmosphere. The three dozen new pieces spread over two galleries are digitally souped-up versions of the artists' customary multi-panel photographic format, with a Babel of grafitti-style phrases in English, Hebrew and Arabic the artists themselves semaphorically gestulating and primally screaming, their figures distorted as if in a funhouse mirror.   COTTER    ODILI DONALD ODITA: 'NOTES FROM PARADISE,' Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Dec. 31. The Nigerian-born, Tallahassee-based Mr. Odita paints hard-edged, gridded, beautifully color-coordinated abstractions with intimations of landscape and African textile design. They are a pleasure to look at, and the wedding of Modernism and traditionalism is something to ponder.   JOHNSON    LORI TASCHLER, JG Contemporary, 505 West 28th Street, (212) 564-7662, through Dec. 18. Ms. Taschler's mysterious, sweetly melancholic paintings and pastels feature singular, emblematic objects or scenes: a simple house flanked by bare trees; an oven with its door invitingly open; a suspension bridge; a person sleeping with a cat on a sofa. Painted with faux-naïve simplicity and soft edges in shades of one or two muted colors, the images seem to emerge from dreams or transcendentalist reveries.    JOHNSON    JOEL-PETER WITKIN: 'HEART BEATS DUST,' Ricco-Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through Dec. 31. The pioneer of high-art, gross-out, Postmodernist photography continues to produce faux-antique pictures of amputees, hermaphrodites, severed body parts and absurdly overwrought erotic tableaus. He has also ventured, unconvincingly, into surrealistic collage and he has applied paint by hand to some of his prints. A good title for this exhibition would be ''Lost in Transition.''    JOHNSON    Other Galleries    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE,' City Hall Park, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 14. Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated Neo-Pop style by this English artist include cartoon fashion models painted on freestanding sheets of glass; life-size, enamel on steel representations of new cars; a half-dozen blocky, multicolored domestic animals that would made good furniture for a children's playground; a quartet of playhouse-scale, 19th-century-style buildings of painted plywood entitled 'Village?'; and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows.    JOHNSON     SHI CHONG: 'RADICAL REALISM,' Ethan Cohen, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, through Dec. 18. Said to be one of China's leading realist painters, Mr. Shi here presents two approaches to the female nude. Photorealist paintings of models who have been slathered in paste and have objects attached to them look so much like big photographs it is hard to believe they are hand-made. Other paintings, apparently done from direct observation and made with a tender, slightly brushy touch read as empathic meditations on the mortality of the flesh.   JOHNSON    Last Chance    BRYAN HUNT: 'AIRSHIPS,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, closes tomorrow. Mr. Hunt became known in the mid 70's for beautiful sculptures in the form of miniature dirigibles made with balsa wood interior framing and paper skins covered with metal leaf or paint. Eight of these works, ranging in length from 40 to 64 inches, are on view here. Attached to the wall at one end, they hover mysteriously overhead.   JOHNSON    'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, closes tomorrow. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life.    COTTER    RICHARD KERN/LILY VAN DER STOKKER, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through tomorrow. These separate solo shows could be presented under the single title ''Innocence and Experience.'' Mr. Kern's voyeuristic, snapshot-style pictures of women -- staged using attractive models -- are uncommonly visceral instances of the so-called male gaze. Ms. van der Stokker's aggressively charming pastel-colored wall paintings of abstract blobs, cartoon flowers, plaid patterns and quirky texts project a childlike sweetness, wholesome family values and mischievous ironies.

It was nearly half a century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous. This show, as Edna sings, is ''all about me.'' It's a joy to be with a Broadway diva who doesn't pretend otherwise (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BEN BRANTLEY    * 'DEMOCRACY.' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters. It may take you 15 minutes or so to become oriented as to the rules and players on the drama's fragmented political field. But as you watch the well-oiled, highly polished 10-actor ensemble, led by James Naughton and Richard Thomas, you're likely to find yourself echoing the sentiments of a government functionary caught up in the surge of tension and relief in a closely fought voting session. ''Never mind football!'' he exclaims. ''Try parliamentary democracy!'' (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    + 'THE GOOD BODY' In her tremendously popular ''Vagina Monologues,'' Eve Ensler exposed the connections between taboos about the discussion of female sexuality and women's oppression. Ms. Ensler has now moved on -- to her belly button. As she relates in ''The Good Body,'' ''I said the word vagina vagina vagina a million times. I thought I was home free. I had finally come to like my vagina. Until one day I realized the self-hatred had just crept up into my stomach.'' Like ''Vagina Monologues,'' ''The Good Body'' aims to uplift and to empower as it entertains. Ms. Ensler wants to soften the ever-fraught relationship between American women and their bodies. In between reflections on her own uncertain journey toward finding the beauty in imperfection, Ms. Ensler offers the perspectives of women she turned to for enlightenment. But the stylish production, directed by Peter Askin, can't obscure the fact that Ms. Ensler's new material is less compelling than the ''Vagina'' testimonials. Truly fresh insights are in short supply. Where ''Vagina Monologues'' broke new ground, ''Good Body'' mostly sticks to well-trodden pathways (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $81.25; a limited number of $26.25 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the performance.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    + 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows heading to a Broadway theater near you this fall, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25.  ISHERWOOD    + ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother,'' directed by Michael Mayer. Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage, folding towels, making cocoa: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these two first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    *++ 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production, directed with brisk straightforwardness by Scott Ellis. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, all of whom manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    + 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she's met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to the Lyceum Theater on Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. The movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago, the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49, Ms. Goldberg is now an established performer, and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg remains an engaging presence, but this sluggish show desperately needs a stringent theatrical intelligence. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen different characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing. ''Whoopi'' is still good company, to be sure. And yet, as anyone who has observed her eclectic career knows, she is perhaps not always the best judge of material. ''Whoopi'' offers further evidence that, innately incandescent though she may be, Ms. Goldberg's gifts shine brightest when they are strictly harnessed (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25.  ISHERWOOD    Off Broadway    'BELLE ÉPOQUE' The époque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. As in their prior collaboration, ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' the authors seek to strip away the sentimental varnish that has congealed around popular depictions of the milieu they are exploring. Ms. Clarke and Mr. Mee are intrigued by the gloom beneath the gaiety. ''Belle Époque'' focuses on the painter who immortalized the denizens of Montmartre in his art. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. And Ms. Clarke's staging has a bustling freedom that is a fine theatrical metaphor for the restless speed of Toulouse-Lautrec's acute eye, forever settling on unexpected moments and awkward poses. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle Époque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $70.  ISHERWOOD    'THE FOREIGNER' The Cinderella schlemiel has clearly become Matthew Broderick's most trusted onstage alter-ego. Having buffed this persona to a high sheen as the inhibited accountant Leopold Bloom in the hit Broadway musical ''The Producers,'' Mr. Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There's no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, which includes Frances Sternhagen and Kevin Cahoon, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.  BRANTLEY    * 'THE GOD OF HELL' Sam Shepard's robust new farce, which he has described as ''a takeoff on Republican fascism,'' is neither a smooth nor subtle play. But at its best it has a punch-drunk paranoia that brings to mind Mr. Shepard's salad days as the ultimate wild young dramatist of several decades ago. Directed by Lou Jacob, this 90-minute portrait of an old-time America invaded by a cruel new breed of Americans starts off much more satisfyingly than it finishes. And what it has to say about a nation forced to march in regimental lockstep is pretty standard agitprop. But unlike, say, the more literal-minded ''Embedded,'' Tim Robbins's satire about the invasion of Iraq, ''The God of Hell'' pokes fun at its own righteous self as well as its broad political targets. The show's top-of-the-line cast is led by Randy Quaid and J. Smith-Cameron, who are priceless as a politically naïve farming couple in rural Wisconsin (1:20). Actors Studio Drama School Theater, 151 Bank Street, (212) 279-4200. Mondays, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Ms. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousness of Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1900. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    * 'RODNEY'S WIFE' Seemingly light conversation scrapes the skins of the characters in Richard Nelson's sharply etched study of dislocation, loneliness and sexual betrayal, directed by the playwright and and starring David Strathairn as a fading American movie star working in Rome. And you are always aware of the strain and snappishness that arises when people politely avoid saying what is on everyone's mind. Long before the unspoken is brought out for airing, Mr. Nelson and his fine cast have created a full emotional geography of a family, replete with deserts and bogs and patches of quicksand. Though the play, which traces the conflicts among the women in the life of Mr. Strathairn's alcoholic character, is centered on what movie ads used to call an ''illicit passion,'' there is nothing prurient about this production. What it offers instead is a deep and sorrowful understanding of how much loneliness there often is in lust. The excellent cast includes Maryann Plunkett, Jessica Chastain and, in a shrewdly mannered performance in the title role, Havilland Morris (1:45). Playwrights Horizons Mainstage Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.  BRANTLEY    'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Snapshots from the past reveal layers of guilt, dissatisfaction and recrimination in the family history. Emotional entrapment, and the desperation it causes, have become obsessive themes in Mr. Allen's work, and they constitute almost the whole fabric of ''A Second Hand Memory.'' Amid the pervasive aura of doom, Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors, who include Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos'' and a particularly fine Beth Fowler, provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences before our eyes, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    *++ 'SIN (A CARDINAL DEPOSED)' Sins come in assorted sizes, but it's hard to take the full measure of the misdeeds exposed in this sober play about the sexual-abuse scandal that unfolded in New England over the past decades. Michael Murphy's quietly disturbing play, drawn from documentary evidence, reveals with devastating clarity the dubious role that Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, played in a tragedy that irreparably damaged hundreds of families and destroyed more than a few lives. The play is a theatrically unadorned re-enactment of a literal deposition given by Cardinal Law in the presence of a pair of lawyers and one of the victims of abuse pursuing a civil case against the church. The play is inevitably static. But listen closely, and a chilling drama can be detected beneath the restrained talk about notes scrawled on decades-old letters. It's the exposure of the moral and bureaucratic mechanics behind the church's failure to protect its members from the destructive acts of its priests. Perhaps also visible, underneath the strained but cordial mask of propriety presented by John Cullum, who plays Cardinal Law, is another drama, the public stripping away of a man's illusions about his moral righteousness (1:30). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $51.25.  ISHERWOOD    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'AFTER THE SUNSET' Starring Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Brett Ratner (PG-13, 93 minutes). You'd have to search high and low to find screen lovers with less romantic chemistry than Mr. Brosnan and Ms. Hayek in ''After the Sunset,'' a jewel-heist frolic so stale it feels like a retread of a retread. Mr. Brosnan has finally reached the age of flab, and the sight of Ms. Hayek's extravagant cleavage spilling over his hairy paunch isn't especially pretty. Even by the fanciful rules of caper comedies, ''After the Sunset'' is a fraudulent entertainment. Except for the opening chase, its action sequences are strictly routine, and the overall tone strains after a wit and style that appear far beyond the director's grasp.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'ALEXANDER' Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 173 minutes). There comes the moment in the career of many directors when they are compelled to tell the story of a great man in whose life they seem to see a glimmer of their own image. Francis Ford Coppola had Preston Tucker, the automotive innovator who tried and failed to challenge Detroit in much the same way as the filmmaker took on Hollywood, while Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson each had Jesus. Now, Oliver Stone has Alexander the Great, the Macedonian tyrant who cut a bloody swath through the ancient world to no obvious end other than, if Mr. Stone's big, blowsy movie is to believed, get away from his kvetch of a mother. And what a kvetch she was! Mad of eye and teased of hair, Olympias, played with nose-flaring gusto by Ms. Jolie, was the mother of all monstrous mothers, a literal snake charmer whose love for her only son had the stench of incestuous passion and the tedium of the perpetual nag. For Alexander (Mr. Farrell, upstaged by an epically bad dye job), the oedipal plot would only thicken because he also loved Olympias's most loathed enemy, her husband and his father, Philip, the King of Macedon (Mr. Kilmer). The struggle between Olympias and Philip, these primordial warring female and male forces, would be reproduced in both Alexander's bisexual desires and his rapacious conquest of the feminized East. In other words, Alexander became his dad to waylay his mom.  MANOHLA DARGIS    * 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael García Bernal, Fele Martínez and Javier Cámara. Directed by Pedro Almodóvar (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The great Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless film makers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almodóvar, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grace of ''Bad Education,'' which ricochets back and forth between 1964 and 1980, with a finale set mostly in 1977, is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. Once a beautiful boy soprano, he/she was abused by a priest, the principal in his Catholic boys school. As the film deepens and the characters' mistaken and multiple identities accumulate, the priest returns from the past in a new, desperate guise. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling itself and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual. It insists that stories, the stories within stories, and the fantasies they crystallize, are the best (and maybe the only) tools at our disposal for making sense of it all.  HOLDEN    'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.  A.O. SCOTT    'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off again. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of both charm and obvious intelligence? At the screening a lot of women were cackling lustily every time the camera zoomed in on Bridget's bulbous posterior, which of course looks much like the posterior of most women who don't live for Pilates and in Beverly Hills. Ms. Kidron took obvious delight in this unhappy view, too. She either really disliked her star or thinks humiliating other women is great sport. Whatever the case, you have to wonder why all these women (you go, sister!) relish the spectacle of a normally well-coiffed, highly paid Academy Award-winning actress, who dates rock stars no less, looking so bad. Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, as plush and appealing as an Eiderdown comforter, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck. Doesn't the poor thing read fashion magazines or go shopping in London's boutiques and groovy outdoor markets? Doesn't she wash her hair?  DARGIS    'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy with a screenplay by Chris Columbus, adapted from John Grisham's novel ''Skipping Christmas.'' The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. Until he stumbles upon it in an act of giving, he doesn't realize there is only one true path to the saccharine suffocation of ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' Its name is Hemlock Street, and he happens to live on it with his wife (Ms. Curtis) and their grown daughter (Julie Gonzalo). For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community.  HOLDEN    'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Born in Scotland in 1860, Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' has been revisited numerous times, as in the splendid 1952 Disney animation, and has become an emblem for everlasting youth, both healthy and less so. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. Based on the play by Allan Knee, ''The Man Who Was Peter Pan,'' the film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children and the two adult actors exchange suitably noble looks even when Ms. Winslet's décolletage threatens to play peek-a-boo. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote.  DARGIS    * 'A FOND KISS' Starring Atta Yaqub and Eva Birthistle. Directed by Ken Loach (R, 104 minutes). It is small consolation that ''A Fond Kiss,'' Ken Loach's gripping Romeo-and-Juliet story of lovers from different cultures who dare to flout traditional taboos and plan to marry doesn't end in their deaths. Whether or not Casim Khan (Mr. Yaqub), a second-generation Pakistani immigrant living in Glasgow with his devoutly Moslem family, and Roison Hanlon (Ms. Birthistle), a spirited Scottish teacher in a Catholic school remain together, the movie leaves you with nagging worries about the future of any intercultural relationship once the passion cools. English-language East-West domestic dramas usually tip the scales in favor of modernity, with the high-principled, hidebound Asians, headed by a fulminating patriarch ultimately to be pitied for their rigidity and adherence to traditional ways. But ''A Fond Kiss'' is equally sympathetic to both sides.  HOLDEN    * 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes try to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced them into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Anything but dull and ordinary, this computer-animated feature has a clean and vibrant visual style and is organized around a strong, fascinating idea. Mr. Bird (''The Iron Giant'') uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world where ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology and trades in its subtlety for noise and over-familiar thrills.  SCOTT    *  'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost naïve belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging his personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight. Crisp performances by Ms. Linney, as Kinsey's wife, and Mr. Sarsgaard, as his first research assistant bring the complexities of Kinsey's life into sharp relief.  SCOTT    'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year-old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show (a Grade C ''Amazing Race'') with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine.  HOLDEN    'THE POLAR EXPRESS' With the voices of Tom Hanks and Michael Jeter. Peter Scolare, Nona Gaye, Eddie Deezen and Charles Fleischer. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (G, 97 minutes). Based on the 32-page children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, this new animated feature has received attention for the advanced technology employed to make the film and the heart-skipping amount of money reportedly spent to transpose the story from page to screen. I suspect that most moviegoers care more about stories and characters than how much money it took for a digitally rendered strand of hair to flutter persuasively in the wind. Nor will they care that to make ''Polar Express'' Mr. Hanks wore a little cap that transmitted a record of his movements to a computer, creating templates for five different animated characters. It's likely, I imagine, that most moviegoers will be more concerned by the eerie listlessness of those characters' faces and the grim vision of Santa Claus's North Pole compound, with interiors that look like a munitions factory and facades that seem conceived along the same oppressive lines as Coketown, the red-brick town of ''machinery and tall chimneys'' in Dickens's ''Hard Times.'' Tots surely won't recognize that Santa's big entrance in front of the throngs of frenzied elves and awe-struck children directly evokes, however unconsciously, one of Hitler's Nuremberg rally entrances in Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will.'' But their parents may marvel that when Santa's big red sack of toys is hoisted from factory floor to sleigh it resembles nothing so much as an airborne scrotum.  DARGIS    * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future.  DARGIS    THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE' With the voices of Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and Rodger Bumpass. Directed by Steven Hillenburg (PG, 88 minutes). If nautical nonsense be something you wish for, then this big-screen expansion of the popular Nickelodeon show will be just the ticket. SpongeBob and his best pal Patrick set off on a rambling quest to recover a stolen crown and prevent Plankton from taking over Bikini Bottom and driving poor Mr. Krabs out of business. If none of this makes sense to you, fear not; it won't necessarily make any more after the movie is done. In any case, the point of ''SpongeBob'' is not sense but nonsense, and the film, like the series, is a giddy celebration of pure childishness, which makes it a refreshing antidote to the glowering machismo that dominates so much pop culture.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tatou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou) who holds fast to the hope that her young solider fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to do them part, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style thats part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes. Watching gears and wheels whir inside a clock, no matter how precisely calibrated the mechanism, quickly loses its appeal. With ''A Very Long Engagement,'' Mr. Jeunet has again proved himself an admirable watchmaker. Armed with an enormous bag of special-effects tricks, he recreates a bygone era with digital wizardry, manic energy, a fastidious attention to detail and only the faintest of heartbeats. Unlike children who bring even the most chewed-up teddy bear to life, however, Mr. Jeunet shows no interest in animating the characters in his dollhouse world.  DARGIS    Rock/Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    RICHARD BUCKNER, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. Women and booze keep letting Richard Buckner down, and his glum, scuffed-up voice is just right for songs that bring together the depressive sides of honky-tonk country and singer-songwriter confessionals. Tonight at 8, with Paul K. opening; admission is $12.  JON PARELES    * ROSANNE CASH/LARRY KIRWAN, 150 West 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 620-5000. Rosanne Cash writes about the ache and aftermath of love with durable folky melodies, chiseled lyrics and calmly telling insights. She underplays her songs, letting them hit home quietly. In this series called ''Acoustic Cash,'' she shares the stage with fellow songwriters, talking and singing. Larry Kirwan is the songwriter behind Black 47, the New York Irish band whose songs mingle history and the multicultural present. Tonight at 7; admission is $35.  PARELES    CLAUS FEST 2004, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900. It's the season of giving as bands repay radio stations for their air time. WXRK, better known as 92.3 K-Rock, receives its tribute from an assortment of rockers including Korn, with its deep-bottomed, traumatized growls; the Guns 'n' Roses/Stone Temple Pilots merger Velvet Revolver; the earnest but upbeat Jimmy Eat World; the post-punk update of Franz Ferdinand; and the bleak, Tool-style hard rock of Chevelle. Tonight at 7; tickets are $32.92 to 52.92.  PARELES    AMY CORREIA, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Ms. Correia's quavery, off-center voice isn't as fragile as it sounds. On her new album, ''Lakeville'' (Nettwerk), the characters in her songs are often barely hanging on, but there's a clarity in her details and a bluesy streak in her voice that suggests they'll hang on tightly. A. M. and Amos Lee share the bill. Tonight at 7; admission is $12.  PARELES    MARSHALL CRENSHAW, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Mr. Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $15.  PARELES    THE DANIELSON FAMILE, Northsix, 66 North 6th Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. In various configurations including the Danielson Famile (with his siblings) and Br. Danielson, Daniel Smith sings earnestly about Christian faith and the vagaries of the flesh. The low-fi songs lurch and tinkle, yelp and coo. Tonight at 9 with Kimya Dawson and P.G. Six; admission is $10.  PARELES    * ANI DiFRANCO, Count Basie Theater, 99 Monmouth Street, Red Bank, N.J., (732) 842-9000. Ms. DiFranco's articulate, uninhibited songs and poems are about staying true to her complicated self: feisty and vulnerable, polysexual, uncompromising and politically engaged, but never humorless. She can strum a guitar and sling words at hyperspeed, or swerve toward jazz and funk; for this tour, she's accompanied by Todd Sickafoose on upright bass. In business (she runs her own label, Righteous Babe Records) as in her music, she's as independent as they come. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $37.50.  PARELES    THE EAST VILLAGE OPERA COMPANY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Tyley Ross, a tenor, lovingly sings Donizetti, Verdi, Franck and Rossini, backed by everything from hard-rock to pedal steel guitar to accordion oom-pah. Cleverness reigns. Sunday night at 7 and 9; admission is $20.  PARELES    MELISSA FERRICK, The Stone Pony, 913 Ocean Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732) 502-0600. Somewhere between Ani DiFranco and Melissa Etheridge, Ms. Ferrick slings an acoustic guitar and belts songs filled with bravado. Saturday night at 8; tickets are $13, $15 at the door .  PARELES    *THE FRAMES, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. The Frames, who can fill arenas in their native Ireland, are unembarrassed by sincerity, and their songs build from folky beginnings to jolts of rock to anthemic choruses that come across as joyfully heartfelt. They have a fiddle, too. Tonight at 7, with the Zincs opening, and at 9:30; admission is $15; sold out but returns may be available.  PARELES    ROBERT GORDON, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703.. After a short flirtation with 1970's punk, Mr. Gordon fell in love with rockabilly and had a hit with a remake of ''Red Hot.'' He's still twanging. Tomorrow night at 10 with the Barry Ryan Band opening; admission is $10.  PARELES    * JULIANA HATFIELD, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Ms. Hatfield's voice is usually sweet and clear, but there's a steely determination behind it. In oddly shaped, meticulous tunes, she sings about suicidal tendencies and anorexia, addiction and paranoia, masochism and obsession and heartbreak. As Ms. Hatfield's songs tell it, life is an endless round of impulsive, often self-destructive acts; she is the victim or the victimizer by turns, and most of the time she avoids self-pity. Ms. Hatfield doesn't just get mad; she gets precise. And her most recent album, ''In Exile Deo'' (Zoe), has some of the best songs of her career. Tomorrow night at 9:30; admission is $15.  PARELES    *  TH' LEGENDARY SHACK SHAKERS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, and Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. From Kentucky by way of Nashville, Th' Legendary Shack Shakers have come up with a twisted Southern rock that tosses together rockbilly, polka, punk, old blues, Tom Waits and lyrics that scramble the Bible and the backwoods. They're rowdy, but there's more to them than that. At Mercury Lounge tonight at 11:30, with Oakley Hall at 10:30, the Navigators at 9:30 and Dusty Wright and the Jaguars at 8:30; admission is $10. At Southpaw Sunday night at 8, with the Crevulators opening; admission is $8.  PARELES    DARLENE LOVE'S CHRISTMAS SHOW, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 749-5838. Darlene Love was the voice on some of Phil Spector's most unforgettable productions: ''He's a Rebel,''  ''Today I Met the Boy I'm Gonna Marry'' and, on his Christmas album, ''Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home).'' She'll be belting them all with a band and choir. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $35 to $65.  PARELES    MAMAYA AFRIKA, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Female singers from Africa, the Caribbean and the United States share the bill in this benefit for breast cancer awareness. They include Albita, the gutsy-voiced Cuban expatriate; the South African singer Lorraine Klaasen; Fantcha, who sings the lilting mornas of Cape Verde; Coumba Sidibe, who is steeped in the Wassoulou tradition of Mali; and six others. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $50 and $150.  PARELES    ANDERS OSBORNE, TriBeCa Rock Club, 16 Warren Street, TriBeCa, (212) 766-1070. Mr. Osborne was born in Sweden but he has done his best to become a full-fledged New Orleans rocker, teaming up with brass bands and making his guitar moan the blues. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, with Mary McBride opening; tickets are $15 in advance, $20 the day of the show.  PARELES    * EDDIE PALMIERI AND LA PERFECTA II/SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA, Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100. This double bill looks back to a golden age of salsa in the 1960's and 70's. In the early 60's, the pianist Eddie Palmieri's aggressive, stripped-down Conjunto La Perfecta, with its front line of two trombones and flute, revolutionized the sound of Latin music. La Perfecta II revisits the old repertory with the benefit of Mr. Palmieri's decades of experience as both dance-music dynamo and jazz iconoclast. Anyone who has heard a salsa band in New York City has probably seen some of the members of the Spanish Harlem Orchestra: they're the virtuosic journeymen who are among New York City's great musical resources. As the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, they reclaim salsa classics under the direction of the keyboardist Oscar Hernandez. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $25 to $35.  PARELES    * MARIANNE PILLSBURY, Arlene's Grocery, 95 Stanton Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-1633, On her debut album, ''The Wrong Marianne'' (www.mariannepillsbury.com), Marianne Pillsbury is as frank as Liz Phair and as tuneful and upbeat as the Go-Go's, dissecting romantic disasters and then bouncing back with light-hearted choruses. She's as tough as she is irrepressible. Tonight at 8; admission is $7.  PARELES    SASHA, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. Tonight, this wildly popular progessive-house D.J. is to begin a monthly residency at the gargantuan Chelsea nightclub Crobar. It's a revival of sorts: the promoters are clearly hoping to duplicate the success Sasha achieved with his partner, John Digweed, in the late 1990's, when the two had a monthly gig at another gargantuan Chelsea nightclub: Twilo, which closed three years ago. Don't expect the dawning of a new era, but do expect a good party: Sasha has a knack for pleasing huge crowds without (for the most part) pandering to them. He eschews both the obvious and the unusual, topping his steady, thumping beats with complicated electronic patterns that slowly decay and mutate. Tonight after 10, with Jimmy Van M and Sean Cusick; advance tickets are $30.  KELEFA SANNEH    LOS STRAITJACKETS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. With enough concepts for an extra band or two, Los Staitjackets play twangy surf-rock, often perform in Mexican wrestling masks and have plenty of Christmas songs (they released a Christmas album in 2002). Sunday night at 8, with the World Famous Pontani Sisters opening; tickets are $15.  PARELES    TRASHCAN SINATRAS, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Tuneful pop survives in Scotland, where the Trashcan Sinatras reach back to the 1960's and 70's, particularly folk-rock and the Beach Boys, for songs that chime and harmonize about wistful yearnings. The group is playing an acoustic set. Tomorrow and Sunday nights at 6:30; admission is $15.  PARELES    * SOPHISTICATED & SEXY, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-0200. Now long removed from their pioneering quartet Jodeci, K-Ci and JoJo continue to sing some of the most extreme R & B on the planet -- and, when they feel like it, some of the most suavely traditional. With a neck-flexing moan or a throat-scratching growl, they can conjure up a desire so intense it's nearly indistinguishable from terror, then turn around and croon a winsome ballad. The duo headlines Sophisticated & Sexy, a party that also features the comedian Capone and the hip-hop pioneer DJ Hollywood. If it's half as entertaining as the bombastic invitation (which warns, ''Absolutely no denim,'' and promises, ''We leave the building at 4 a.m.''), it'll be a riot. Tomorrow night, doors open at 9, with a complimentary buffet at 10:30; tickets are $35 in advance and -- inevitably -- ''More at the door!''  SANNEH    EL TRI, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Midtown, (212) 564-4882. El Tri, a long-running rock band from Mexico City, has been voraciously and good-humoredly assimilating rock from north of the border, spanning blues-rock, country-pop and arena anthems while adding its own jaunty vocals and jocular observations for a big, beery good time. Sunday night at 6; tickets are $45.  PARELES    VORDUL MEGA, Sin-é, 148-150 Attorney Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077. In 2001, the local duo Cannibal Ox released ''The Cold Vein'' (Definitive Jux), an appealingly labyrinthine debut album that matched thick, jagged beats with dense, murky, half-speed rhymes that you didn't hear so much as absorb. Vordul Mega, half of Cannibal Ox, released a solo debut, ''The Revolution of Yung Havoks'' (Nature Sounds), that isn't nearly as dense, nor as absorbing: once he spelunked, but now he mainly just rambles. Sunday night at 8, with Billy Woods, Monsta Island Czars, Karneige, Akir and more; admission is $8.  SANNEH    DAR WILLIAMS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Joan Baez loves Ms. Williams's songs, which apply the style of 1960's coffeehouse folkies to the ever more complicated 21st century. With meticulous imagery and forthright melodies, Ms. Williams examines tangled loves and friendships along with the mixed blessings of adulthood. Tonight at 8, with Anna Egge opening; tickets are $30.  PARELES    VANESSA WILLIAMS, Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway at 46th Street, (212) 730-8200. Vanessa Williams's career as a pop and Broadway crooner includes two Christmas albums, which should supply much of her material for these concerts. Tonight through Sunday at 8; tickets are $35 to $85.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BABY JANE DEXTER, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609. Ms. Dexter, a natural rock-blues belter who refrains from full-tilt shouting, roams all over the place, from Cole Porter to R.E.M. to Rod McKuen to the Rolling Stones, in her new show ''Bread and Gravy.'' If her bold re-evaluations of songs don't always work, they tear away the associations crusted on songs we think we know to reveal new avenues of interpretation. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:15. Cover: $25 and a $15 minimum.  HOLDEN    * ANDREA MARCOVICCI, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Authentic glamour may be an oxymoron. But Ms. Marcovicci becomes its embodiment when she performs. In her new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire,'' she suggests a latter-day hybrid of Audrey Hepburn, the most gracious, elegant and beautifully spoken of Hollywood princesses, and Mabel Mercer, that ruefully witty, all-wise, healing muse of a thousand romantic sorrows. Like Mercer's, her singing is really speech-song executed with an elocutionary flourish and stylized acting. The show weaves music, biography and analysis of Astaire iconography into a definitive career summary. It focuses, in particular, on his relationships with the composers who wrote for him. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $60, with a $55 dinner required at the early shows and a $20 minimum at the late shows.  HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with ''Singing Astaire,'' a lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative, and fast-paced. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11. Cover: $40.  HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * ANDY BEY, Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater, Symphony Space, 95th Street at Broadway, Upper West Side, (212) 864-5400. Mr. Bey possesses a skyscraper voice: bass-baritone lows, accurate falsetto highs. A singer and pianist, he is ferociously talented, and his comeback over the last decade is one of the more welcome developments in jazz; his new album, ''American Song'' (Savoy Jazz), bears this out. He plays two shows with his trio, tonight and tomorrow at 8:30; tickets are $21; 64+ and students, $16.  BEN RATLIFF    TERENCE BLANCHARD QUINTET, Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, (212) 854-7799. Terence Blanchard has been making changes in his groups lately, and with his last album, ''Bounce'' (Blue Note), he added to his group a guitarist from Benin, Lionel Loueke, who uses finger tapping and electronic techniques that add something new to the straight-ahead jazz context. Tomorrow at 8 pm; tickets are $25.  RATLIFF    JOEY DeFRANCESCO, Dizzy's Club Coca Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9595. Mr. DeFrancesco is a Philadelphia-based Hammond organ player who has put in his time learning with the masters of the instrument; he has a tough, churning, rhythmic sound, and his group includes the tenor saxophonist David (Fathead) Newman. Sets through Sunday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    * MARK TURNER AND FLY, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)  242-1063. An excellent co-operative trio, with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard. Some of its music sounds chamberlike, some Latin, some funky; some, with breathtaking long-line improvisations and tight group communication, seems to propose a new model for saxophone trios. Tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    BILL FRISELL QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. You have to give it to Bill Frisell for the long haul: having come out of the fairly fragmentary downtown music scene of the 1980's, he is still building an audience and working on his own ideal music, sometimes gentle or earthy Americana, sometimes harmonically complex, and unarguably jazz. He can also, on occasion, make your jaw drop with his guitar playing. This group augments his regular trio (including the bassist Tony Scherr and the drummer Kenny Wolleson) with the soft-toned trumpeter Ron Miles and the tenor saxophonist Greg Tardy. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tomorrow; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    JOHN HICKS, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. A presence in New York since the 1970's, Mr. Hicks is a steamroller of a mainstream-jazz pianist, loading up the music with thick chords as if he wanted to do McCoy Tyner one better. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    * GRETCHEN PARLATO, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. The winner of the recent Thelonious Monk Competition for jazz vocals, Ms. Parlato is a newcomer of great promise: in standards, bossa novas and originals, through long tones and subtle inflections of rhythm, she deeply enters the musical field of her band, directing from within rather than throwing her voice out front. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; tickets are $15 per set.  RATLIFF    * DIANNE REEVES, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Jazz singers these days seem more likely to find their information in the restraint and mystery of bossa nova than in the unapologetic splendor of, say, Sarah Vaughan. Maybe it's because they feel that reticent music implies modernity more quickly. If so, Dianne Reeves is their opposite: she's only lightly concerned with reticence. She has an enormous (and Vaughan-inspired) voice, and an enormous talent, and she offers it up to stun her audience. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $25-$37.50.  RATLIFF    * PHAROAH SANDERS-KENNY GARRETT QUARTET, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121. When this pair of saxophonists -- both influenced by Coltrane, but Mr. Sanders from the late period and Mr. Garrett from the middle period -- got together last year, with Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums, it might not have looked like much on paper: another reshuffling of good players. But they seemed to set one another off like rockets. Here was Mr. Garrett, playing alto with his rabbitlike speed and remarkable rhythmic articulation; here was Mr. Sanders playing a lush and cataclysmic form of free jazz, with high overtones seeping into low runs, bunches of notes smeared together into one: an effusive, thoroughly worked-out language of pure sound. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10 with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $32.50 to $35.  RATLIFF    LUCIANA SOUZA WITH ED SIMON, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8770. Ms. Souza, the jazz mezzo-soprano, who grew up in Brazil, has an alert, clear voice, with undertones of calm conversation and the sound of a well-rested intelligence. She is also a composer of intriguing art songs, and recently she set Pablo Neruda poems to music for an album on Sunnyside called ''Neruda.'' She'll perform that music here, in duets with the pianist Mr. Simon. Tomorrow at 7:30; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    * JACKY TERRASSON TRIO WITH RAVI COLTRANE, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. With his new group (Sean Smith on bass and Eric Harland on drums), Mr. Terrasson has gotten back to what he does best: creating stunning, fizzy trio music, absolutely flexible in form as it breaks up into pieces and then coheres again; it has a low-impact virtuosity and a likable enthusiasm. Ravi Coltrane, on tenor and soprano saxophones, is a guest with the band this week. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 to $30.  RATLIFF    LARRY WILLIS TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, (212)  864-6662. Larry Willis has played for years with Roy Hargrove's quintet and Jerry Gonzalez's Fort Apache Band, and he is a widely literate musician. But this gig is straight-ahead jazz, New York-style, with Buster Williams and Al Foster. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera can excel on occasion in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in Verdi's ''Aida,'' which was originally conceived as grand opera. Lots of different singers are wafting through this season's revival; they include Norma Fantini as Aida, Irina Mishura as Amneris, and Ambrogio Maestri, who made his company debut earlier in the run, as Amonasro. When he's on, Franco Farina is a ringing Radames; and the excellent Marcello Viotti conducts. Add a few armies of dancers and horses and you could have a fine old time. Tomorrow afternoon at 1, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'I VESPRI SICILIANI' The convoluted story and clunky libretto to Verdi's ''Vespri Siciliani'' has probably kept this mature and stirring opera from gaining repertory status. So it's good to have this neglected and important work back at the Metropolitan Opera after 22 years, a revival of John Dexter's grimly abstract 1974 production. In the impassioned and stylish performance by the conductor Frédéric Chaslin, ''I Vespri Siciliani'' emerges as a musically distinguished opera that, with its French inflections, anticipates Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlos.'' Don't fret if the story, based on the 1282 uprising and massacre by the people of Palermo, Sicily, against their hated French occupiers, seems implausible. Just let yourself get swept away by the music. The cast includes the husky-voiced (and husky-framed) tenor Francisco Casanova, the elegant baritone Leo Nucci and the stentorian bass Samuel Ramey. The Romanian soprano Nelly Miricioiu takes over the role of Elena from Sondra Radvanovsky. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'TANNHÄUSER' At 50, the German dramatic tenor Peter Seiffert, who has a major career in Europe, has finally made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the daunting title role of Wagner's ''Tannhäuser,'' a revival of Otto Schenk's handsomely realistic 1977 production. For Met fans it was worth the wait. Mr. Seiffert had all the power and stamina you could want from a Wagnerian tenor, and, rarer, true tenorial colorings and impressive vocal agility. Though he has a barrel-chested physique, he gives a charismatic, physically nimble and sympathetic portrayal of the medieval knight and song minstrel torn between the erotic pleasures of Venus and the idealized love of Elisabeth. Thomas Hampson brings the elegance of the fine German lieder singer he is to his distinguished and vocally robust portrayal of Wolfram. Mark Elder conducts a lithe and vividly colored performance. Since opening night, though, new artists have stepped into the two leading female roles. Petra-Maria Schnitzer sings Elisabeth and Elizabeth Bishop sings Venus. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.  TOMMASINI    Classical Music    ARDITTI QUARTET This British string quartet, one of the most polished and adventurous new-music ensembles currently playing, offers a program that promises, characteristically, to be both arduous and rewarding. Included are Conlon Nancarrow's String Quartet No. 3, Elliott Carter's String Quartet No. 5, Gyorgy Ligeti's String Quartet No. 2 and the New York premiere of Helmut Lachenmann's String Quartet No. 3 (''Grido''). Tomorrow at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $32.  ALLAN KOZINN    THE ASSADS The Brazilian brothers Sérgio and Odair Assad have been regarded as one of the world's pre-eminent guitar duos ever since their first recordings were released in the mid-1970's, when they were barely out of their teens. Their program on Sunday includes selections from Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco's ''Well-Tempered Guitars'' (Op. 199) and from Leo Brouwer's ''Danzas Concertantes,'' as well as Rodrigo's Tonadilla, Sérgio Assad's Suite Brasileira and transcriptions of works by Scarlatti, Ravel, Egberto Gismonti, Hermeto Pascoal and others. Tomorrow at 8, the 92nd Street Y, at 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $40.  KOZINN    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Because of space restrictions, you don't often hear symphonies on the Barge, though tonight the American pianist Jeffrey Biegel will offer Beethoven's Fifth (in Liszt's arrangement) from the keyboard, along with works by Grieg and Gershwin. Tomorrow night and Sunday are more typical Barge programs with the violinist and artistic director Mark Peskanov joined by Steven Beck (piano) and Dmitry Kouzov (cello) in music by Haydn, Beethoven and Rachmaninoff. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $25.  JEREMY EICHLER    MEASHA BRUEGGERGOSMAN This young Canadian soprano comes trailing raves, some of them comparing her with Jessye Norman. The comparison comes too easily, since Ms. Brueggergosman is also black and built on a large frame, but her CD of Barber's wonderful ''Knoxville: Summer of 1915'' and other works reveals a major talent. Here she sings more Americana, songs by Copland and William Bolcom, as well as works by Ravel, Joseph Marx, Xavier Montsalvatge and Britten. J. J. Penna is the pianist. Tonight at 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $25.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    * CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER This weekend, the Chamber Music Society presents the first American performances of ''Pulse Shadows,'' a large-scale work by the distinguished British composer Harrison Birtwistle. Running more than an hour, the piece consists of interwoven movements from two discrete compositions -- ''Nine Movements for String Quartet'' and ''Nine Settings of Celan.'' The second of the two works is based on the writing of Paul Celan, the Romanian-born Jew whose rugged and often surreal poetry treated World War II and the Holocaust with enormous power. Among the selected texts is ''Todesfuge,'' Celan's most famous poem, which will be sung by the soprano Lisa Saffer. Other performers include the Flux Quartet, the cellist Fred Sherry, the bassist Edgar Meyer, the violist Paul Neubauer and the clarinetist David Shifrin. Reinbert de Leeuw conducts, and Mr. Birtwistle will be on hand for post-performance discussions. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48, student rush $10.  EICHLER    * CHARLES CURTIS AND ALECK KARIS If the term ''avant-garde'' ceases to apply to deceased artists, Morton Feldman's long, thoughtful and detailed music has to be described with simple terms like ''beauty.'' Often inspired by visual artists, Feldman had antique carpets in mind in ''Patterns in a Chromatic Field,'' an 80-minute work that reflects the subtle variations in old dyes with microtonal writing. The cellist Charles Curtis, a new-music specialist whose past collaborators have ranged from Rudolf Firkusny to LaMonte Young, and the pianist Aleck Karis, whose credits include Speculum Musicae, recorded the piece for Tzadik Records this year, and are performing it live this weekend. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Great Hall at Cooper Union, 7 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. Tickets: $20, $15 for students and 65+.  MIDGETTE    * CONTINUUM The Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is the most renowned of the so-called mystical minimalists, but he also has a tendency to split audiences, with some listeners finding his spare and often repetitive idiom to be breathtakingly beautiful in its simplicity while others find it merely simplistic. Both views may be based on an incomplete sense of his oeuvre, which is in fact broad and diverse enough to surprise both fans and detractors. For this reason, we can welcome this Pärt retrospective performed by the dependable Continuum ensemble, featuring lesser-known vocal works (''Wallfahrtslied'' and ''Es sang vor langen Jahren''), larger ensemble works (''Silouans Song'' and ''Trisagion'') and chamber music (the Passacaglia for Violin and Piano, among others). The ensemble has a good track-record with Mr. Pärt's music and this concert should be eye-opening. Sunday at 3 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 772-4448. Tickets: $15 to $25, students $10.  EICHLER    GRAMERCY TRIO The members of the Gramercy Trio have busy musical lives outside this ensemble. The acclaimed Boston-based pianist Randall Hodgkinson has a wide-ranging career and is a regular at the Bargemusic concerts in Brooklyn. The cellist Jonathan Miller is a 30-year veteran of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the founding director of the Boston Artists Ensemble. The violinist Sharan Leventhal is a concerto soloist, chamber music player, teacher and champion of contemporary music. Yet, all three are deeply committed to the Gramercy Trio, which plays a typically adventurous program on Sunday afternoon at Merkin Concert Hall with works by Turina, Schnittke, Schumann and a new score by the composer Fred Hersch, who draws from the jazz and classical traditions. Sunday at 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212) 501-3303. Tickets: $15.  TOMMASINI    SIMON KEENLYSIDE AND JULIUS DRAKE Simon Keenlyside, the fine British baritone, showed one side of his range as a performer at Lincoln Center two seasons ago in Trisha Brown's staging of Schubert's ''Winterreise,'' in which he demonstrated that he can dance as well as sing. This year, he's returning to a more conventional corner of the arena, offering a program of classic lieder and melodies. There's nothing here not to like, as long as you like Schubert, Brahms, Mahler and Ravel (whose ''Histoires naturelles,'' with their amusing portraits of various animals, are always a good final set); and Julius Drake is a worthy partner as his accompanist. Sunday afternoon at 2, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5050. Tickets: $48.  MIDGETTE    'LOST OBJECTS' This latest collaboration by the founders of Bang on a Can -- the composers Michael Gordon, Julia Wolfe and David Lang -- is a theatrical rumination on people and things that have been left behind in the sweep of history and civilization. The subjects, touched on in a libretto by Deborah Artman, include everything from extinct species and languages to abandoned technologies and lost rituals. The music is performed by Concerto Köln, a period instrument band that normally performs Baroque music, along with vocal soloists and a choir, the Virtuoso Singers. The staging is by the filmmaker François Girard, with sets by François Seguin and live remixing by DJ Spooky. Tonight and Tomorrow at 7:30. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $60.  KOZINN    NANCARROW AT THE PIANO Conlon Nancarrow's most interesting music is played by a machine (the player piano) not people, but musicians are pursuing Nancarrow as a human interest story this season at the Miller Theater. Tonight Christopher Taylor, one of the more ardent explorers of new music on the piano, takes up four of his pieces and surrounds them with contemporaries like Bartok, Ives, Adams and Ligeti. The music starts at 8 p.m. at the Miller Theater, 2960 Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-1633. Tickets are $20.  BERNARD HOLLAND    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC AND NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER MUSIC Last week, with his first guest conducting appearance of the New York Philharmonic's season, David Robertson again proved that he is one of the most accomplished, dynamic and interesting musicians on the scene. For his second program this weekend Mr. Robertson offers something new, Steve Reich's Triple Quartet, a Philharmonic first, and something familiar, Beethoven's Eighth Symphony. The brilliant German violinist Christian Tetzlaff will also be the soloist in Bartok's Violin Concerto No. 2. But that's not all for Mr. Tetzlaff, who will join select players from the orchestra for a Sunday afternoon program of chamber music at the 92nd Street Y, with works by Mozart, Debussy and Dvorak. New York Philharmonic: Today at 2 p.m. and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $22 to $90. New York Philharmonic Chamber Music: Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y (92nd Street and Lexington Avenue), (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $40.  TOMMASINI    NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY New music, as well as new talent, is a focus of the New York Youth Symphony, which includes a composition program among its various youth-based activities. This weekend it showcases its young performers in a work by a young composer, Joshua Penman, whose ''Songs the Plants Taught Us'' will have its premiere. More veteran talents are also on display: Glenn Dicterow, concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic, is the soloist in Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto and the final piece, a real showcase for the young players in the orchestra, is the Brahms Second Symphony. Sunday afternoon at 2, Carnegie Hall, (212) 581-5933. Tickets: $7 to $55.  MIDGETTE    ORPHEUS WITH UTE LEMPER This potent German cabaret singer may have enlarged her following with roles in musicals such as ''Chicago'' and ''Cabaret,'' but she first made her name singing the tartly expressive music of interwar Berlin, and especially the songs of Kurt Weill. She returns to this bread-and-butter repertory in a program this weekend with the conductorless Orpheus chamber orchestra. In addition to the music of Weill, Ms. Lemper will sing songs by Eisler and Brel as well as lesser known selections in Yiddish, Hebrew and Arabic. Orpheus will add to the mix Schulhoff's jazzy Suite for Chamber Orchestra and Schoenberg's dark Chamber Symphony No. 2, begun in 1906 and completed in exile in 1939. Tomorrow night at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $88.  EICHLER    PAULA ROBISON This excellent flutist has become an institution within an institution in her annual series at the Met Museum. This year she takes on ''The Great Vivaldi,'' with music that may be better suited than most to the museum's acoustically suspect Temple of Dendur. Here is an array of concertos for chamber orchestra and solo instruments, including flutes, trumpets and guitar. A concert in March completes the series. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $55.  OESTREICH    KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ An enterprising new-music pianist who invariably assembles interesting and often provocative programs, Ms. Supové is offering ''The John Adams-Louis Andriessen Jukebox: In Shuffle Mode'' this weekend. The three-concert recombinant program draws on the piano and chamber works of Mr. Adams, the American post-Minimalist composer who has become ubiquitous lately, and Mr. Andriessen, a Dutch composer whose work has touched on a variety of styles. Each night of this series, Ms. Supové shuffles the works, sometimes offering the same piece in different versions (Mr. Adams's ''Phrygian Gates,'' for example, is heard all three nights, but on Sunday it is performed in a ''Remix Version,'' a collaboration with the sound designer and singer Dafna Naphtali). In addition to Ms. Naftali, Ms. Supové's collaborators will include Vijay Iyer, a composer and computer performer, and Randall Woolf, a composer who will be operating CD turntables. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 7:30, the Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Tickets: $12.

Full reviews of recent dance performances:  nytimes.com/dance.    * BALLET HISPANICO Tina Ramirez and her vibrant dancers have proved that classical ballet and Latin social dancing go very well together, in a way that says a good deal about each discipline. The company will perform ''Night Club,'' a dramatic trilogy, set to Latin music and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, Alexandre Magno and Sergio Trujillo (tonight and tomorrow and Sunday nights). Peter Pucci's new ''Eternamente y Un Dia'' (''Forever and a Day''), which focuses on Mexican history and is set to Mexican folk songs, will be performed on a matinee program that also includes Ramón Oller's ''Bury Me Standing,'' which celebrates the Gypsy and is set to Gypsy, Spanish and European folk songs. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $45.  JENNIFER DUNNING    DODGE DANCE COMPANY AND THEATER OF DREAMS The two troupes will present an evening of dance and theater called ''Dream Street,'' which is intended to remind audiences of the talents possessed by performers with disabilities. Several of the pieces draw on traditional African dance, hip-hop and poetry by Maya Angelou. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 12:30 p.m., BRIC Studio, 57 Rockwell Place, Brooklyn, (212) 273-6312. Tickets: $15; $10 for students.  DUNNING    HISKE DOOPER AND MICHOU SZABO Ms. Dooper, a modern dance choreographer from Rotterdam who has also trained at the Merce Cunningham school, will present ''Faja Lobi,'' a new dance for eight women that examines love. Mr. Szabo, a pianist and filmmaker as well as a choreographer, will perform in two new trios he created to music by Mark Coniglio and Guy Yarden. Tonight at 9; tomorrow at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street at Washington Street, West Village, (212) 978-3729. Tickets: $12.  DUNNING    'FLAMENCO FIESTA' Andrea del Conte Danza España and the guest artists Oscar Valero and José Junco celebrate the company's 25th anniversary, through Dec. 12, in a theater whose intimacy approximates a prime condition for viewing this age-old dance form. Today (and Thursdays and Fridays through Dec. 11) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays (through Dec. 12) at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+; $25 (Thursdays).  DUNNING    * FRESH MEAT FESTIVAL This festival of dance, theater, puppetry and music opens with the sleepily subversive Clarinda MacLow's ''Comic Blunders,'' which she describes as darkly comic solo rituals. Ms. MacLow shares the program with two musicians, Dafna Naphtali and Hans Tammen, who plays something called the endangered guitar. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Chocolate Factory Theater, 5-49 49th Avenue at Vernon Bouevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 482-7069. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    LIZ GERRING DANCE COMPANY In her new ''Tonight Clearing, Tomorrow Clear,'' Liz Gerring uses abstract movement derived from an emotional base to suggest that despite the cloudiness of the world today, there can be clarity in the future. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. Tickets: $15.  JACK ANDERSON    * ERICK HAWKINS DANCE COMPANY Katherine Duke, a former lead dancer with the company, has put together a program of excerpts from Hawkins's ''Black Lake'' and ''Greek Dreams, With Flute.'' The evening is dedicated to the late Ralph Dorazio, a founding and important collaborator of Hawkins, whose sculptural sets and props captured and enhanced the choreographer's distinctive blend of delicacy and power. The program, a fund-raiser for the company, also includes an excerpt from Lucia Dlugoszewski's ''Radical Ardent.'' Tonight at 7:30., Rose Studio, 10th floor, Rose Building, 70 Lincoln Center Plaza, (845) 216-2214. Admission is by a donation of $35 at the door.  DUNNING    SAM KIM AND LUCIANA ACHUGAR Ms. Kim and Ms. Achugar have performed with interesting modernists, including Sara Rudner, DD Dorvillier, Susan Rethorst and Wil Swanson. The new works on their shared program sound provocative, too. Ms. Kim's ''Vince and Alison'' is named for the founders of the pop band Yaz. In Ms. Achugar's ''Super Natural Return to Love,'' six women suggesting a Greek chorus examine the oppression inherent in homogeneity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $20.  DUNNING    MOVEMENT RESEARCH IMPROVISATION FESTIVAL This annual event brings together a host of dancers in solos, duets and group improvisations in which performance skills are challenged by the wild unpredictability of each risk-taking moment. Tonight and Sunday night at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $12.

DUNNING    NEW YORK CITY BALLET ''The Nutcracker'' is here. What more needs to be said? The company is performing George Balanchine's magical production of Tchaikovsky's fairy-tale ballet, complete with lovely snowflakes and sugarplums and malicious marauding mice. There's lots of sumptuous spectacle and delicious dancing. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $26 to $96.

Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 3 p.m., Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, (212) 598-0400, Ext. 222. Tickets: $15 for adults; $10 for children 12 and under, students with identification and 65+.  DUNNING    * WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE: CHO HEUNG DONG DANCE COMPANY Mr. Cho, a veteran dancer and choreographer, and his 18-member company will present ''The Spirit of Korean Dance,'' a program of court, shamanic, Buddhist and folk dances. Tonight at 8, Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400 or www  .worldmusicinstitute.org. Tickets: $30.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    'MANNY FARBER: ABOUT FACE,' AND 'KATHARINA SIEVERDING: CLOSE UP,' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; through Jan. 16 and Jan. 23, respectively. P.S. 1's two major fall shows are about identity defined through two different approaches to self-portraiture. Mr. Farber's show is a 40-year retrospective of work by a California artist well known as a film critic, who since the 1970's has been producing large, highly detailed still lifes. The pictures are dense with autobiographical data, from images of movie-house candy bars to handwritten notes-to-self to flowers picked fresh from the garden. The work of Ms. Sieverding of Germany could hardly be a greater visual contrast. Her series of colossal head shots suggesting film advertisements are mostly of her own face. The results are both an exercise in self-celebration, and the simultaneous creation and undermining of a personal-is-political icon. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+.  COTTER    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. This show, presenting about 40 works, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  GRACE GLUECK    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. There are problems with the new Museum of Modern Art, starting with its egregious $20 ticket price. The fairly inchoate assemblage of paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films from the last 30 years in the suite of double-height galleries for contemporary art on the second floor spells trouble, too. The Modern clearly still has to deal with the conflict between its historic authority when it comes to art of the first 60 or so years of the 20th century and the indeterminacy of its taste in recent art. But the building is exquisite, a great gift to the city, and you would have to be either comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that the Modern virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., now retold in an installation that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. The mobs will inevitably congregate on that floor, so a good alternative for visitors is to explore the museum within the museum: the suites of galleries for prints, drawings, photographs and design -- mostly intimate places to peruse some of the greatest of all works of modern art. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  KIMMELMAN    * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.  KIMMELMAN    XAVIER VEILHAN: 'THE PHOTOREALIST PROJECT,' National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, (212) 369-4880, through Jan. 2. This inventive French sculptor has conceived an unusual installation for five Photorealist paintings from the 70's by masters of the genre Robert Bechtle, Robert Cottingham, Richard Estes, Ralph Goings and Richard McClean. The paintings are installed flush with walls of glossy, stretched black plastic and lighted by low, cylindrical floor lamps. The effect approaches but doesn't quite reach a magical, dematerialized illusionism. It is interesting but not an improvement on the standard white cube gallery.  KEN JOHNSON    Galleries: Uptown    BRYAN HUNT: 'AIRSHIPS,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through Dec. 11. Mr. Hunt became known in the mid 70's for beautiful sculptures in the form of miniature dirigibles made with balsa wood interior framing and paper skins covered with metal leaf or paint. Eight of these works, ranging in length from 40 to 64 inches, are on view here. Attached to the wall at one end, they hover mysteriously overhead.  JOHNSON    A. R. PENCK: 'CONSTRUCTIONS,' Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Dec. 18. Mr. Penck's primitivistic paintings featuring stick figures and pictographic signs became internationally visible during the triumph of German Neo-Expressionism in the 1980's. This exhibition features something different: compact, slapdash constructions mostly from the early 70's made of found objects and materials like bottles, cardboard boxes, wire, fabric, tape and newspaper. Displayed on a single table that almost fills the gallery, they create a vaguely comical theater of the absurd.  JOHNSON    * 'PICASSO-BECKMANN/BECKMANN-PICASSO,' Richard L. Feigen, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 31. This wonderfully illuminating exhibition brings together two great 20th-century artists who are not ordinarily closely associated. It includes significant as well as interesting minor works by both. Picasso's colorful, thickly painted late-30's picture of a bull goring a horse is worth a visit all by itself, and so is Beckmann's ''Soldier's Dream'' from 1942, a darkly comical allegory of lust and death with bird-man and bird-woman lovers in a cage and a floozy sitting outside with a big clock.  JOHNSON    FRANZ WEST: 'EARLY WORK,' Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through Jan. 8. If you liked the funky, colorful sculptures by Mr. West displayed outdoors at Lincoln Center and Central Park last summer, you should check out this show of early works. In the early 70's, this Austrian sculptor covered ordinary objects like bottles, machine parts and pieces of furniture in gauze and plaster, creating lumpy, grungy objects that look like rejects from a Platonic form-making factory.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    CARMEN CICERO, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 226-1660, through Dec. 14. Mr. Cicero's cartoonish, easel-size narrative paintings combine humor, gothic mystery and Magritte-style surrealism. In some, men in trenchcoats and fedoras walk through landscapes of dreamlike desolation or drive old cars on nocturnal country roads; in others emblematic images like a knight's helmet or a locomotive hover like mystical signs. Mr. Cicero is not an Outsider -- he has been exhibiting his art since the early 50's and earned a M.F.A. degree in 1991 -- but his work has the hair-raising feeling of a self-taught visionary's.  JOHNSON    JUDITH PAGE: 'BEAUTY AND BEAST,' Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161, through Dec. 22. Ms. Page's main expressive tool is a resinous Silly Putty-colored paint that she uses liberally as though it were some kind of psychic effluvium in combination with black and white drawing and painting. She employs it to layer comical creatures and demons over old diary pages and to create portraits of Mouseketeers as toothy, gimlet-eyed ghouls. And she makes hideously sensuous small sculptures by immersing toys and food products in the viscous pink stuff.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    ODILI DONALD ODITA: 'NOTES FROM PARADISE,' Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Dec. 31. The Nigerian-born, Tallahassee-based Mr. Odita paints hard-edged, gridded, beautifully color-coordinated abstractions with intimations of landscape and African textile design. They are a pleasure to look at, and the wedding of Modernism and traditionalism is something to ponder.  JOHNSON    RICHARD KERN/LILY VAN DER STOKKER, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through Dec. 11. These separate solo shows could be presented under the single title ''Innocence and Experience.'' Mr. Kern's voyeuristic, snapshot-style pictures of women -- staged using attractive models -- are uncommonly visceral instances of the so-called male gaze. Ms. van der Stokker's aggressively charming pastel-colored wall paintings of abstract blobs, cartoon flowers, plaid patterns and quirky texts project a childlike sweetness, wholesome family values and mischievous ironies.  JOHNSON    'SELECTIONS FROM THE E. BUK COLLECTION OF TECHNOLOGY AND INVENTION,' Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212) 462-2668, through Dec. 18. This fascinating assortment of curious old machines displayed in an old-fashioned, wood-framed glass cabinet will interest contemporary sculptors as well as history of technology buffs. Among the more than 70 objects are a wooden perpetual motion machine; a ''Violin Vibrophone'' that transmits therapeutic sounds from a violin body through earpieces; an electrical machine designed to enable painless dentistry; and a 1929 television.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    ARCHIE RAND: 'THE 19 DIASPORA PAINTINGS,' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205, through Jan. 12. The mercurial Mr. Rand has created a series of canvases representing the Biblical history of Israel using imagery copied in a loose, colorful style from various sorts of adventure comic books. Each is captioned by Hebrew words of a traditional prayer. The paintings are unconvincing visually, but the effort to wed traditional religion and Postmodernist art is interesting.  JOHNSON    SHI CHONG: 'RADICAL REALISM,' Ethan Cohen, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, through Dec. 18. Said to be one of China's leading realist painters, Mr. Shi here presents two approaches to the female nude. Photorealist paintings of models who have been slathered in paste and have objects attached to them look so much like big photographs it is hard to believe they are hand-made. Other paintings, apparently done from direct observation and made with a tender, slightly brushy touch read as empathic meditations on the mortality of the flesh.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, closes tomorrow. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored-pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William S. Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff.  JOHNSON    IAN HAMILTON FINLAY, UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 52nd Street, (212) 713-2885, closes today. Mr. Finlay, a Scottish poet, artist, gardener and rebel, born in 1925, aches for the past and feels its impact on the present. His graphic works are inspired by the French Revolution, classical art and literature, boats, World War II and his renowned garden. An expert typographer, he often fashions images from words or combinations of letters alone, placing them in punchy arrangements. Best are his images of ships, which occasionally take wry turns. Type fanciers and concrete poetry buffs will have a picnic; others may want to take along a cryptograph to fathom his buried meanings.  GLUECK    GEORGE GROSZ: 'NEW YORK DRAWINGS,' Nolan/Eckman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 925-6190, closes tomorrow. This fascinating exhibition presents a series of ink drawings made to illustrate a 1941 collection of writings by the journalist Ben Hecht called ''1001 Afternoons in New York.'' Grosz, who moved to New York in 1933, may have done his best work during his Weimar years, but this show of never-before-exhibited drawings shows he did not leave behind his extraordinarily prehensile draftsmanship or his incisively satiric imagination.  JOHNSON    SEONNA HONG: 'ANIMUS,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-0979, closes tomorrow. This Los Angeles-based artist won an Emmy this year for her animation work on an episode of the television cartoon series ''My Life as a Teenage Robot.'' Her first solo gallery exhibition in New York presents retro-style illustrations beautifully painted on wood panels for a yet-to-be-published picture book about a little girl and a vicious black dog.  JOHNSON    CILDO MEIRELES: 'DESCALA' AND 'STRICTU,' Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 315-0470, closes tomorrow. Concerned with changing the spectator's role from passive to active, Mr. Meireles, a Brazilian environmental artist, offers a heavy-breathing account of how spaces can be used to control mind and body. On a wooden interrogation table in a dark room is a statement condemning societal authoritarianism. The viewer is invited to don handcuffs attached to a ball and chain while viewing the second work: flat ladders and runged poles line the walls of a smaller gallery, creating a handsome compositional surround, Mondrianesque in its reductive effect.  GLUECK    BEATRIZ MILHAZES: 'SUMMERTIME,' James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-9500, closes tomorrow. This Rio de Janeiro-based painter continues to produce large abstractions that teeter on the divide between the expressive and the decorative. Ms. Milhaze layers radiating blossoms, target patterns, stripes, hearts, butterflies and peace signs onto gridded patchworks of rich color. With their sensuously textured, gold leaf-accented surfaces and neo-hippie exuberance the paintings promise but don't quite deliver something really over the top.  JOHNSON    SITE, Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, closes tomorrow. A cool new addition to Madison Square Park is the ''Shake Shack,'' a fast-food kiosk designed by the architecture firm Sculpture in the Environment (SITE) that was founded in 1970 by James Wines. It is partly a Postmodern hot dog stand, partly green architecture with its vegetation-covered roof and partly a way to generate revenue for the park. The small show of models and drawings at Senior & Shopmaker gives some background on Mr. Wines's inventive and admirable effort to integrate form, function and environment.

Theater    Broadway    + 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories, from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95.  BEN BRANTLEY    * 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly half a century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in 'The Little Shop of Horrors,' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous. This show, as Edna sings, is ''all about me.'' It's a joy to be with a Broadway diva who doesn't pretend otherwise (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BRANTLEY    * 'DEMOCRACY.' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters. It may take you 15 minutes or so to become oriented as to the rules and players on the drama's fragmented political field. But as you watch the well-oiled, highly polished 10-actor ensemble, led by James Naughton and Richard Thomas, you're likely to find yourself echoing the sentiments of a government functionary caught up in the surge of tension and relief in a closely fought voting session. ''Never mind football!'' he exclaims. ''Try parliamentary democracy!'' (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Today at 2 and 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    + 'THE GOOD BODY' In her tremendously popular ''Vagina Monologues,'' Eve Ensler exposed the connections between taboos about the discussion of female sexuality and women's oppression. Ms. Ensler has now moved on -- to her belly button. As she relates in ''The Good Body,'' ''I said the word vagina vagina vagina a million times. I thought I was home free. I had finally come to like my vagina. Until one day I realized the self-hatred had just crept up into my stomach.'' Like ''Vagina Monologues,'' ''The Good Body'' aims to uplift and to empower as it entertains. Ms. Ensler wants to soften the ever-fraught relationship between American women and their bodies. In between reflections on her own uncertain journey toward finding the beauty in imperfection, Ms. Ensler offers the perspectives of women she turned to for enlightenment. But the stylish production, directed by Peter Askin, can't obscure the fact that Ms. Ensler's new material is less compelling than the ''Vagina'' testimonials. Truly fresh insights are in short supply. Where ''Vagina Monologues'' broke new ground, ''Good Body'' mostly sticks to well-trodden pathways (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performances today at 2 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $81.25; a limited number of $26.25 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the performance.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    + 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows heading to a Broadway theater near you this fall, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 2 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25.  ISHERWOOD    + ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother,'' directed by Michael Mayer. Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage, folding towels, making cocoa: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these two first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. No matinee tomorrow. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    + 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she's met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to the Lyceum Theater on Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. The movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago, the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49, Ms. Goldberg is now an established performer, and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg remains an engaging presence, but this sluggish show desperately needs a stringent theatrical intelligence. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen different characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing. ''Whoopi'' is still good company, to be sure. And yet, as anyone who has observed her eclectic career knows, she is perhaps not always the best judge of material. ''Whoopi'' offers further evidence that, innately incandescent though she may be, Ms. Goldberg's gifts shine brightest when they are strictly harnessed (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25.  ISHERWOOD    *+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 2 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    'BELLE ÉPOQUE' The poque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. As in their prior collaboration, ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' the authors seek to strip away the sentimental varnish that has congealed around popular depictions of the milieu they are exploring. Ms. Clarke and Mr. Mee are intrigued by the gloom beneath the gaiety. ''Belle Époque'' focuses on the painter who immortalized the denizens of Montmartre in his art. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. And Ms. Clarke's staging has a bustling freedom that is a fine theatrical metaphor for the restless speed of Toulouse-Lautrec's acute eye, forever settling on unexpected moments and awkward poses. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle Époque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $70.  ISHERWOOD    * 'DOUBT: A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. (Think ''The Children's Hour'' crossed with ''Agnes of God.'') But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m.  BRANTLEY    'FIVE BY TENN' This selection of Tennessee Williams one-acts offers little cause for excitement. The four recently discovered plays are of some academic interest, but sparkling gems they aren't. The director Michael Kahn employs an actor portraying Williams himself to introduce the plays, a faintly apologetic gesture. ''Summer at the Lake,'' written in 1937, features principal characters who prefigure the combative mother and son in ''The Glass Menagerie.'' The play is just a fragment truncated by a melodramatic ending, but the voice already bears the hallmarks of Williams's style. But elsewhere, the voice is diluted, distorted or disguised. In ''The Fat Man's Wife,'' from 1938, Williams is trying on a faux-urbane manner that fits him like a rented tuxedo in the wrong size. The major disappointment is ''And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens,'' from around 1959, a sour story of a transvestite's degradation at the hands of a sailor, and one of a very few plays in which Williams dealt directly with homosexuality (3:00). Manhattan Theater Club, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. No matinee tomorrow. Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $48; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets available at the box office up to an hour before the performance.  ISHERWOOD    'THE FOREIGNER' The Cinderella schlemiel has clearly become Matthew Broderick's most trusted onstage alter-ego. Having buffed this persona to a high sheen as the inhibited accountant Leopold Bloom in the hit Broadway musical ''The Producers,'' Mr. Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There's no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, which includes Frances Sternhagen and Kevin Cahoon, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.  BRANTLEY    * 'THE GOD OF HELL' Sam Shepard's robust new farce, which he has described as ''a takeoff on Republican fascism,'' is neither a smooth nor subtle play. But at its best it has a punch-drunk paranoia that brings to mind Mr. Shepard's salad days as the ultimate wild young dramatist of several decades ago. Directed by Lou Jacob, this 90-minute portrait of an old-time America invaded by a cruel new breed of Americans starts off much more satisfyingly than it finishes. And what it has to say about a nation forced to march in regimental lockstep is pretty standard agitprop. But unlike, say, the more literal-minded ''Embedded,'' Tim Robbins's satire about the invasion of Iraq, ''The God of Hell'' pokes fun at its own righteous self as well as its broad political targets. The show's top-of-the-line cast is led by Randy Quaid and J. Smith-Cameron, who are priceless as a politically naïve farming couple in rural Wisconsin (1:20). Actors Studio Drama School Theater, 151 Bank Street, (212) 279-4200. Mondays, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'GUANTÁNAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: you are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60.  BRANTLEY    'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  ISHERWOOD    * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Mr. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousness of Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, (212) 925-1900. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    'PEOPLE ARE WRONG!' A Manhattan couple seeking relief from city stress finds country living more treacherous than expected in this good-natured but ragged rock musical at the Vineyard Theater, a co-production with the Target Margin Theater. A lively young cast infuses the proceedings with comic high spirits even when the musical begins to spin its wheels, or spin out of control. John Flansburgh, one-half of the popular rock duo They Might Be Giants, makes his Off-Broadway debut as one of the luckless country weekenders. He is married to Robin Goldwasser, who wrote the musical with Julia Greenberg. Ms. Greenberg and Ms. Goldwasser are rock songwriters who have never before attempted a full-scale musical. They know their way around a catchy guitar riff and slip comfortably between lilting folk balladry, driving electric-guitar romps and rockabilly hoedowns. Unfortunately, once the musical has established the simple storyline (crazy gardener screws up wedding plans) and put across its sardonic tone, it begins to disintegrate, even as the song list stretches past the horizon (there are 30 tunes) (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Snapshots from the past reveal layers of guilt, dissatisfaction and recrimination in the family history. Emotional entrapment, and the desperation it causes, have become obsessive themes in Mr. Allen's work, and they constitute almost the whole fabric of ''A Second Hand Memory.'' Amid the pervasive aura of doom, Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors, who include Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos'' and a particularly fine Beth Fowler, provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences before our eyes, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    *+ 'SIN (A CARDINAL DEPOSED)' Sins come in assorted sizes, but it's hard to take the full measure of the misdeeds exposed in this sober play about the sexual-abuse scandal that unfolded in New England over the past decades. Michael Murphy's quietly disturbing play, drawn from documentary evidence, reveals with devastating clarity the dubious role that Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, played in a tragedy that irreparably damaged hundreds of families and destroyed more than a few lives. The play is a theatrically unadorned re-enactment of a literal deposition given by Cardinal Law in the presence of a pair of lawyers and one of the victims of abuse pursuing a civil case against the church. The play is inevitably static. But listen closely, and a chilling drama can be detected beneath the restrained talk about notes scrawled on decades-old letters. It's the exposure of the moral and bureaucratic mechanics behind the church's failure to protect its members from the destructive acts of its priests. Perhaps also visible, underneath the strained but cordial mask of propriety presented by John Cullum, who plays Cardinal Law, is another drama, the public stripping away of a man's illusions about his moral righteousness (1:30). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $51.25.  ISHERWOOD    + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 505-0700. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90.  LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    + 'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the United States attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here depicted as a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is continually affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogey. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25.  ISHERWOOD    + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudités. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.  BRANTLEY    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'AFTER THE SUNSET' Starring Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Brett Ratner (PG-13, 93 minutes). You'd have to search high and low to find screen lovers with less romantic chemistry than Mr. Brosnan and Ms. Hayek in ''After the Sunset,'' a jewel-heist frolic so stale it feels like a retread of a retread. Mr. Brosnan has finally reached the age of flab, and the sight of Ms. Hayek's extravagant cleavage spilling over his hairy paunch isn't especially pretty. Even by the fanciful rules of caper comedies, ''After the Sunset'' is a fraudulent entertainment. Except for the opening chase, its action sequences are strictly routine, and the overall tone strains after a wit and style that appear far beyond the director's grasp.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'ALFIE' Starring Jude Law. Directed by Charles Shyer (R, 103 minutes). It's the year of the monkey in the Chinese calendar and the year of the hound in Hollywood. In films as radically different as ''Sideways,'' ''Ray'' and now ''Alfie,'' men are sniffing skirts with a single-mindedness that brings to mind Warren Beatty cruising through ''Shampoo,'' a blow-dryer tucked in his jeans. Filled with womanizers who at once love too much and not quite enough, these films don't really resurrect the hound and, in truth, he never went away. They simply ask you to look deep in those puppy eyes and see the all-too-human man beneath, quivering with heartfelt need, not just animal impulse. Men often behave sexually badly in movies, but it's rare that the hound doesn't get his comeuppance. It's usually only in comedy that such beasts stay true to their baser selves, as in ''Bad Santa,'' where Billy Bob Thornton's womanizing is a self-consciously nasty piece with his boozing and cursing. The comedy in ''Alfie'' is plentiful but bittersweet, and the character's bad behavior pleases more than it repels, principally because Mr. Law's beauty and easy charm go a long way to softening the edges.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'ALEXANDER' Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 173 minutes). There comes the moment in the career of many directors when they are compelled to tell the story of a great man in whose life they seem to see a glimmer of their own image. Francis Ford Coppola had Preston Tucker, the automotive innovator who tried and failed to challenge Detroit in much the same way as the filmmaker took on Hollywood, while Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson each had Jesus. Now, Oliver Stone has Alexander the Great, the Macedonian tyrant who cut a bloody swath through the ancient world to no obvious end other than, if Mr. Stone's big, blowsy movie is to believed, get away from his kvetch of a mother. And what a kvetch she was! Mad of eye and teased of hair, Olympias, played with nose-flaring gusto by Ms. Jolie, was the mother of all monstrous mothers, a literal snake charmer whose love for her only son had the stench of incestuous passion and the tedium of the perpetual nag. For Alexander (Mr. Farrell, upstaged by an epically bad dye job), the oedipal plot would only thicken because he also loved Olympias's most loathed enemy, her husband and his father, Philip, the King of Macedon (Mr. Kilmer). The struggle between Olympias and Philip, these primordial warring female and male forces, would be reproduced in both Alexander's bisexual desires and his rapacious conquest of the feminized East. In other words, Alexander became his dad to waylay his mom.  DARGIS    * 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael García Bernal, Fele Martínez and Javier Cámara. Directed by Pedro Almodóvar (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The great Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless film makers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almodóvar, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grace of ''Bad Education,'' which ricochets back and forth between 1964 and 1980, with a finale set mostly in 1977, is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. Once a beautiful boy soprano, he/she was abused by a priest, the principal in his Catholic boys school. As the film deepens and the characters' mistaken and multiple identities accumulate, the priest returns from the past in a new, desperate guise. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling itself and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual. It insists that stories, the stories within stories, and the fantasies they crystallize, are the best (and maybe the only) tools at our disposal for making sense of it all.  HOLDEN    'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.  A.O. SCOTT    'BIRTH' Starring Nicole Kidman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer (R, 100 minutes). A metaphysical puzzle -- part ghost story, part melodrama -- in which Ms. Kidman plays Anna, a wealthy Manhattan widow, who meets a young boy claiming to be her dead husband. The premise is strange, almost preposterous, but Mr. Glazer presents it with a hushed, solemn intensity that keeps you in a state of pleasurable disorientation. The screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière wrote many scripts for Luis Buñuel, and there is an element of arch surrealism in this tale, which might be cold and mechanical were it not for Ms. Kidman's performance. ''Birth'' doesn't just ask you to suspend disbelief, but to let go of reason, an invitation that is worth accepting if you can.  SCOTT    'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off again. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of both charm and obvious intelligence? At the screening a lot of women were cackling lustily every time the camera zoomed in on Bridget's bulbous posterior, which of course looks much like the posterior of most women who don't live for Pilates and in Beverly Hills. Ms. Kidron took obvious delight in this unhappy view, too. She either really disliked her star or thinks humiliating other women is great sport. Whatever the case, you have to wonder why all these women (you go, sister!) relish the spectacle of a normally well-coiffed, highly paid Academy Award-winning actress, who dates rock stars no less, looking so bad. Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, as plush and appealing as an Eiderdown comforter, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck. Doesn't the poor thing read fashion magazines or go shopping in London's boutiques and groovy outdoor markets? Doesn't she wash her hair?  DARGIS    'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy with a screenplay by Chris Columbus, adapted from John Grisham's novel ''Skipping Christmas.'' The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. Until he stumbles upon it in an act of giving, he doesn't realize there is only one true path to the saccharine suffocation of ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' Its name is Hemlock Street, and he happens to live on it with his wife (Ms. Curtis) and their grown daughter (Julie Gonzalo). For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community.  HOLDEN    'FEAR AND TREMBLING' Starring Sylvie Testud and Kaori Tsuji. Directed by Alain Corneau (not rated, 102 minutes; in French and Japanese, with English subtitles). Like ''Lost in Translation,'' Mr. Corneau's film, adapted from an autobiographical novel by Amélie Nothomb, concerns a young woman undergoing a painful and comical process of self-discovery in a Tokyo high-rise. The heroine, Amélie (Ms. Testud) has moved from Belgium to Japan, where she spent her early childhood, and where she takes a job working for a large corporation in the hopes of becoming ''a real Japanese woman.'' It's a doomed project, owing both the the long-standing Japanese suspicion of foreigners and to the intricate codes and hierarchies that govern Amélie's workplace. What starts as a breezy exercise in office anthropology becomes a harrowing, sometimes hilarious exploration of bureaucratic sado-masochism, a blend of ''The Office'' and ''The Story of O'' trasplanted to Asia.  SCOTT    'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Born in Scotland in 1860, Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' has been revisited numerous times, as in the splendid 1952 Disney animation, and has become an emblem for everlasting youth, both healthy and less so. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. Based on the play by Allan Knee, ''The Man Who Was Peter Pan,'' the film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children and the two adult actors exchange suitably noble looks even when Ms. Winslet's décolletage threatens to play peek-a-boo. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote.  DARGIS    'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that it has taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat going meo-o-o-ow.  DARGIS    *  'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost naïve belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging his personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight. Crisp performances by Ms. Linney, as Kinsey's wife, and Mr. Sarsgaard, as his first research assistant bring the complexities of Kinsey's life into sharp relief.  SCOTT    'LA PETITE LILI' Starring Nicole Garcia, Bernard Giraudeau, Jean-Pierre Marielle and Ludivine Sagnier. Directed by Claude Miller (not rated, 104 minutes; in French, with subtitles). In dragging ''The Seagull'' into the age of cellphones, digital video and hip-hop, the ingeniously freewheeling adaptation of Chekhov's 1895 play stirs up a fascinating and contradictory mixture of the eternal and the transitory. But there are hurdles that ''La Petite Lili'' cannot overcome. Abridged and abbreviated, Chekhov's leisurely philosophic reflections evoke a musty aroma of pressed flowers in a scrapbook that's out of tune with the times. The rush to abridge leaves little room for what's left to seep into your bones. In the revelatory final act, many of the original characters converge on a movie set to recreate the events we have already seen. The movie within a movie is a small coup de cinéma.  HOLDEN    * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael García Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. García Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. García Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon.  SCOTT    'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show (a Grade C ''Amazing Race'') with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine.  HOLDEN    * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. We witness, in a series of well-executed set pieces, his evolution from a Nat King Cole-style crooner into an R & B innovator, and then into a performer, arranger and composer who seemed able to span the whole range of American vernacular music. Mr. Foxx, whose speech and movement uncannily resemble Charles's, contributes much more than mimicry. You get the sense that he understands his character completely and can communicate what he knows without stooping to explanation. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances -- notably Ms. Washington as Charles's wife, Della Bea, and Ms. King as one of his backup singers -- gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out. SCOTT    'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.''  HOLDEN    'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale.  SCOTT    * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future.  DARGIS    * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.  DARGIS    Rock/Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    BLUES EXPLOSION, THE GOSSIP, Asbury Lanes, 209 4th Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732) 776-6160; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Blues Explosion, the long-in-the-tooth retro-rock band that used to be called the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, somehow failed to capitalize during the great retro-rock feeding frenzy of a few years ago, perhaps because Mr. Spencer's hammy snarl has aged less well than bandmate Judah Bauer's well-oiled guitar lines. So don't be surprised if the veterans are upstaged by the Gossip, a barebones blues-punk band led by Beth Ditto, possessed of an appealing shivery wail. Sunday night at 9 at the venerable bowling alley Asbury Lanes, with Mike Edison; tickets are $15. Monday night at 9 at Maxwell's; tickets are $15.  KELEFA SANNEH    EVAN DANDO, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. From his days with the Lemonheads to his fitful solo career, Evan Dando at his best, has been able to wrap winsome melodies around chronicles of uncertain romance and an unkempt life, in songs like ''If I Could Talk I'd Tell You.'' Tomorrow night at 10, with the Shore opening; admission is $15.  JON PARELES    * BRITT DANIEL, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Mr. Daniel leads Spoon, a great Texas indie-rock band that wastes neither time nor notes. Spoon's last album, ''Kill the Moonlight,'' was one of 2002's best, a minor masterpiece that reduced every song to a series of gestures: a dash of falsetto, a couple of keyboard notes, a swaggering ''Awright!'' When he sang, ''We could go kick down some doors together/ Stay out till morning, sharp as knives,'' it sounded like the best idea in the world. At this solo show, expect the diehard Spoon fans to feast on whatever he sees to fit to play -- including, perhaps, some previews of Spoon's new album, due to be released sometime next year. Tonight at 10; tickets are $12.  SANNEH    * DIPLO, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Riving Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com. Diplo, one half of the Philadelphia indie-crunk DJ team Hollertronix, comes to town for a Saturday night dance party. Earlier this year, he released a grab-bag solo album, ''Florida'' (Big Dada), but more exciting is his new gig as DJ for M.I.A., the Sri-Lanka-born, London-based rapper and singer and chanter whose debut album is due out early next year. Together, Diplo and M.I.A. just released a fantastic mixtape, ''Piracy Funds Terrorism Volume 1,'' which is better than most proper debut albums; don't leave Rothko without one. Tomorrow night at 11, with Spank Rock; admission is $10.  SANNEH    DISCO BISCUITS, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. The Disco Biscuits have worked their way up the jam-band circuit with blithe rock that veers toward funk and jazz, hovers in circling, hypnotic riffs and sometimes turns into a live version of electronica styles, like drum-and-bass, that are usually concocted on computers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $20.  PARELES    DR. JOHN, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and his florid piano playing not just to New Orleans funk and rhythm-and-blues but to Ellington, standards and songs with a conscience, though his latest album circles back to some New Orleans classics. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 day of the show.  PARELES    * ELY GUERRA, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Ely Guerra is one of the most intriguing songwriters in Mexican rock. Ms. Guerra sings about passion: gazing at it from a distance, then plunging into the turbulence. Her songs incorporate rock, electronica and the torchy emotion of Mexican pop in a shifting balance of poise and obsession. She has just released a new album, ''Sweet & Sour, Hot y Spicy'' (Higher Octave). Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30; admission is $20.  PARELES    ARLO GUTHRIE, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Arlo Guthrie is a master of the tall tale, whether he's singing it or spinning it between songs. He has the gift of making a casual observation both funny and telling. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $38-$65.  PARELES    HOT TUNA, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from the Jefferson Airplane, but it has now long outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis, with Mr. Casady's bass shadowing him from below. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $38.50 and $48.50.  PARELES    * JADAKISS, DON OMAR, the Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-5156. The Yonkers rapper Jadakiss has long been an underground hero, beloved for his slightly rough voice that just makes his clever, deadpan lyrics sound that much smoother. He's having his biggest year ever, buoyed by the success of his marvelous hit single ''Why?,'' and the follow-up, a thug-love duet with Mariah Carey called, ''U Make Me Wanna.'' He is to be joined by Don Omar, one of reggaeton's biggest stars, who delighted a sold-out Madison Square Garden last month with his infectious refrains and with his trouser-dropping -- expect less trouser dropping, but just as many refrains, at this concert. Tonight at 8, with the former Terror Squad member Cuban Link; tickets are $35.  SANNEH    EDDIE AND GERALD LEVERT, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, L.I., (516) 334-0800. This concert pairs Eddie Levert, who was one of the gospel-charged soul singers in the O'Jays, with his son Gerald, who plays the rhythm-and-blues Casanova with alternating promises of fidelity and bedroom skills. Tonight at 8; tickets are $56.50.  PARELES    * LUNA/PALOMAR, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Embracing the legacy of two-guitar New York bands from the Velvet Underground to Television, Luna applies the dynamics of strum, drone and build to Dean Wareham's tales of longing and decadence. As Mr. Wareham sings about high-toned parties, aimless roadtrips and creeping paranoia, the songs start out cool, but the writhing, swelling guitars reveal the obsessions within them. The band is on its final tour, to end early next year. Whimsy and sinew co-exist nicely in the lean, peppy pop-rock of Palomar, a three-woman, one-man band whose songs jump from blithe choruses to wiry guitar patterns to hefty distortion, all at the service of the lyrics' articulate ambivalence. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $18.75 in advance, $20 day of the show.  PARELES    * BOB MOULD, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. As the main songwriter for Husker Du, Bob Mould wrapped troubled thoughts in blaring, unstoppable guitars. Since then, he has veered between melodic punk-rock with Sugar and more introspective songs under his own name. Tonight at 9, with Alex Dezen of the Damnwells opening; admission is $17.  PARELES    O.A.R., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224 . A little reggae, a little folk-rock, a lot of word-of-mouth and O.A.R., an Ohio band whose initials stand for Of a Revolution, has become a college-circuit favorite. Despite its name, O.A.R. is more concerned with romance than politics; it plays easy-strumming three-chord songs suitable for dorm parties, calling for audience participation on choruses like ''Naked with you all night long.'' John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. Tonight and tomorrow at 6:30, with the John Butler Trio opening tonight and the Virginia Coalition opening tomorrow; tickets are $30.  PARELES    * STRAYLIGHT RUN, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. An emo concert headlined by Straylight Run, the Long Island piano-rock act that includes a pair of former Taking Back Sunday members. The band's self-titled debut album (released last month by Victory Records) has a few too many mild ballads, but the members have a knack for writing big choruses that are just unpredictable enough to keep you listening. Expect a roaring sing-along to ''Existentialism on Prom Night,'' which includes a shameless -- and clever -- refrain that begs for crowd participation: ''Sing like you think no one's listening.'' Sunday night at 7, with Hot Rod Circuit, Northstar and Say Anything; tickets are $13.  SANNEH    * CHRIS WHITLEY, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Chris Whitley is steeped in the blues: not good-timey bar-band music but steely, tormented reflections on sin and self-destruction, betrayal and redemption. As he sings about a world of uncertainty and pain, his voice slides while his slide-guitar moans along. Tomorrow night at 8, with Paul Brill opening; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    * ANDREA MARCOVICCI, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Authentic glamour may be an oxymoron. But Ms. Marcovicci becomes its embodiment when she performs. In her new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire,'' she suggests a latter-day hybrid of Audrey Hepburn, the most gracious, elegant and beautifully spoken of Hollywood princesses, and Mabel Mercer, that ruefully witty, all-wise, healing muse of a thousand romantic sorrows. Like Mercer's, her singing is really speech-song executed with an elocutionary flourish and stylized acting. The show weaves music, biography and analysis of Astaire iconography into a definitive career summary. It focuses, in particular, on his relationships with the composers who wrote for him. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $60, with a $55 dinner required at the early shows and a $20 minimum at the late shows.  HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. The trumpeter Steven Bernstein leads his nine-piece mini-big band through Midwestern and Southwestern music of the 1930's with a revisionist, excitable cast of mind. Sets are tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $10.  BEN RATLIFF    * SASHA DOBSON/CHRIS BYARS OCTET, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369. The young singer Sasha Dobson performed a lot with the saxophonist Chris Byars at the old jazz club Smalls, whose owner changed locations and called his new place the Fat Cat. With the recent launching of Small Records and her own release on the label, ''The Darkling Thrush,'' Ms. Dobson returns to her old audience in a new setting. She's a canny improviser with classic Ella-and-Sarah tastes and good pitch; Mr. Byars's arrangements of standards fit her handsomely. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 10; cover charge is $10.  RATLIFF    LOU DONALDSON QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The saxophonist Lou Donaldson reminds you of the earthiness inside jazz. He is also a wild, funny character who always plays better than you expect on an average night. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    STAN GETZ BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. The ubiquitous pianist Bill Charlap, along with the singer Claudia Acuña and the Brazilian jazz band Trio da Paz, play alongside the tenor saxophonist Harry Allen in honor of Getz's New York-to-Rio recorded legacy. Sets tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10, and 11:30, with sets at 8:45 and 10:30 on Sunday; cover charge is $32.50; minimum, $10.  RATLIFF    RUSSELL GUNN AND ETHNOMUSICOLOGY, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Russell Gunn, from St. Louis, is a young hard-core jazz trumpeter who has worked behind R & B stars; logically, he seems to want his work to build a sensible bridge between the jazz and neo-soul audiences. He has a separate, mainstream jazz band, but with Ethnomusicology, he wants to relax you with soul ballads, then to challenge you with crunching dissonance and hard funk. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    * COLEMAN HAWKINS CELEBRATION WITH ERIC ALEXANDER AND GEORGE COLEMAN, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. This is the centennial of the great Coleman Hawkins's birth, and the tribute concerts have been going strong; this one might be particularly good because it's essentially a working group, with Harold Mabern on piano, rather than an ad-hoc confection. The young tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander is probably more indebted to 50's- and 60's-era models like John Coltrane and George Coleman, who appears alongside him in this band. But he and his muse will surely sound good playing ''Body and Soul'' and other Hawkinsiana. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $30; $10 at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    * MARK HELIAS'S OPEN LOOSE, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. The bassist Mark Helias has been a reliable part of a lot of groups around New York for the last few decades, but his own trio is the best setting in which to hear him, as it engages his compositional sense as well as his convincing bounce. With the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby and the drummer Tom Rainey, he steams through winding themes and great ostinato grooves. Tonight at 8:30; cover charge is $10.  RATLIFF    VICTOR LEWIS GROUP, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Victor Lewis is a marvelous drummer, known in the 80's for associations with Stan Getz and Bobby Watson and in the 90's for freelancing and playing with his own band. This one includes the saxophonist Seamus Blake and the trumpeter Terrell Stafford. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20; $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    * BRIAN LYNCH AND SPHERES OF INFLUENCE, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. With a recent Doris Duke Foundation grant, Mr. Lynch wrote new music for his band Spheres of Influence, expanding the group in the process; it's now a nonet, with some of the most exciting musicians in the new Latin-jazz scene including the saxophonist Miguel Zenon, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the percussionist Pedro Martinez. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue near 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 427-0253. The saxophonist Houston Person's background is in the 1950's, when a good deal of jazz was completely submerged in rhythm-and-blues, and he is one of the few mainstream jazz performers today who can routinely find access to the deep language of pleasure from that time. (Many of the others became session musicians, going deeper into the studiousness of jazz or into the meat and potatoes of rock 'n' roll, or they disappeared.) Mr. Person has an elastic, sequential solo-building style that links him to Sonny Rollins, and a fat, breathy tone that links him to Ben Webster. Enjoy him. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $20, and there is a one drink minimum.  RATLIFF    TOOTS THIELEMANS-KENNY WERNER-OSCAR CASTRO-NEVES-AIRTO MOREIRA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. A Belgian-American-Brazilian configuration of jazz musicians with big ears and great songbook knowledge on, respectively, harmonica, piano, guitar and percussion. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $35 at the tables with a $15 minimum, and $20 at the bar with a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    STEVE TURRE QUINTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. The trombonist Steve Turre has knocked around jazz, Latin music, funk and all kinds of professional situations, including a long-standing place in the ''Saturday Night Live'' band; he was also an associate of the great, eccentric saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk and pays tribute to him on a new record, ''The Spirits Up Above'' (Highnote). Sets tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20; there is a $10 minimum.

Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera can excel on occasion in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in Verdi's ''Aida,'' which was originally conceived as grand opera. Lots of different singers have wafted through this revival this season; this afternoon's cast includes Norma Fantini as Aida, Irina Mishura as Amneris and Ambrogio Maestri, who made his company debut this month, as Amonasro. When he's on, Franco Farina is a ringing Radames, and the excellent Marcello Viotti conducts. Add a few armies of dancers and horses and you could have a fine old time. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145 to $315; returns may be available at the box office.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'LA BOHÉME' The ascent of the golden-voiced Russian soprano Anna Netrebko has been so rapid that no doubt many local opera fans are yet to hear her live. This weekend provides another opportunity as she sings Musetta at the Met in Franco Zeffirelli's outsize production of this Puccini favorite. At her side will be Ruth Ann Swenson as Mimi. It's a heftier and more dramatic role for Ms. Swenson, who is better known for her beautifully nimble coloratura soprano, but she held her own last month at the first performance. Elsewhere in the cast, Peter Mattei sings an impressive Marcello, with rich, deep colors in his baritone. Frank Lopardo has replaced Marcelo Alvarez as Rodolfo. Daniel Oren conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.  JEREMY EICHLER    'TANNHÄUSER' At 50, the German dramatic tenor Peter Seiffert, who has a major career in Europe, has finally made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the daunting title role of Wagner's ''Tannhäuser,'' a revival of Otto Schenk's handsomely realistic 1977 production. For Met fans it was worth the wait. Mr. Seiffert has all the power and stamina you could want from a Wagnerian tenor, and, rarer, true tenorial colorings and impressive vocal agility. Though he has a barrel-chested physique, he gives a charismatic, physically nimble and sympathetic portrayal of the medieval knight and song minstrel torn between the erotic pleasures of Venus and the idealized love of Elisabeth. As Elisabeth the soprano Deborah Voigt, who has shed weight and looked splendid, sings with gleaming sound and effortless power. Thomas Hampson brings the elegance of the fine German lieder singer he is to his distinguished and vocally robust portrayal of Wolfram. The mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung is a striking and vocally impassioned Venus, though she is still finding her way into the role technically. Mark Elder conducts a lithe and vividly colored performance. Tonight at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $315.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    Classical Music    FERRARA ENSEMBLE The valuable Music Before 1800 series is presenting this Swiss vocal and instrumental ensemble in ''Très Riche Heures: Gothic Music for the Valois Dukes,'' a program of French courtly love songs from the 14th and 15th centuries. The group, directed by Crawford Young (who also plays the lute in the ensemble), is an outgrowth of a 1984 recording project at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, where it is now an ensemble in residence. Its program includes ballades, rondeaus and instrumental pieces by Machaut, Caserta, Paullet, Foliot, Vaillant and Grenon. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Manhattan, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+.  ALLAN KOZINN    ANDRÉ WATTS This pianist has been an uneven player in recent years, but a chamber music concert at the Metropolitan Museum last week found him in fine shape. For his recital on Sunday, Mr. Watts is performing a varied program that includes a group of Scarlatti Sonatas, Haydn's Sonata No. 58 in C, Schubert's Klavierstücke (D. 946), Debussy's ''Estampes,'' Lizst's ''Hungarian Rhapsody'' No. 13, as well as selections from ''Musica Ricercata,'' a 1951 suite by the great contemporary Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti. Sunday at 3, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $12 to $54.

Museums    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    'ASIAN GAMES: THE ART OF CONTEST,' Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 327-9211, through Jan. 16. What's your game? Chess, go, pachisi, polo? These and many other recreational pursuits are saluted in a jampacked but beguiling show that pegs Asia as the continent of origin for more than a few of the sophisticated games we play today. On view are 200 games and game-related objects covering 2,000 years. They involve games of chance; memory and matching; strategy and physical skill. Elaborate boards for dice-propelled contests like pachisi, backgammon and snakes and ladders; different varieties of dice; intricately carved chessmen; lively examples of playing cards, and intriguing paraphernalia for outdoor sports like polo, are all part of this sumptuous display, enhanced by paintings, prints, sculptures and decorative accessories. A playground for the eye, even a non-gamesman's. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+.  GRACE GLUECK    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.  COTTER    * 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with triggering the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold Böcklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield, and places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.  ROBERTA SMITH    'MANNY FARBER: ABOUT FACE,' AND 'KATHARINA SIEVERDING: CLOSE UP,' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; through Jan. 16 and Jan. 23, respectively. P.S. 1's two major fall shows are about identity defined through two different approaches to self-portraiture. Mr. Farber's show is a 40-year retrospective of work by a California artist well known as a film critic, who since the 1970's has been producing large, highly detailed still lifes. The pictures are dense with autobiographical data, from images of movie-house candy bars to handwritten notes-to-self to flowers picked fresh from the garden. The work of Ms. Sieverding of Germany could hardly be a greater visual contrast. Her series of colossal head shots suggesting film advertisements are mostly of her own face. The results are both an exercise in self-celebration, and the simultaneous creation and undermining of a personal-is-political icon. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+.  COTTER    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. This show, presenting about 40 works, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  GLUECK    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. There are problems with the new Museum of Modern Art, starting with its egregious $20 ticket price. The fairly inchoate assemblage of paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films from the last 30 years in the suite of double-height galleries for contemporary art on the second floor spells trouble, too. The Modern clearly still has to deal with the conflict between its historic authority when it comes to art of the first 60 or so years of the 20th century and the indeterminacy of its taste in recent art. But the building is exquisite, a great gift to the city, and you would have to be either comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that the Modern virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., now retold in an installation that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. The mobs will inevitably congregate on that floor, so a good alternative for visitors is to explore the museum within the museum: the suites of galleries for prints, drawings, photographs and design -- mostly intimate places to peruse some of the greatest of all works of modern art. Prints provide a sublime survey of the medium up to the present. Drawings, packed in like sardines, concentrate on the period 1880 to 1945, with installations in coming months to focus on more recent eras. Photographs, skewed to the present, demonstrate how diverse that medium has become. And design is divided between two spaces, one a dense hodgepodge of objects, new and old, including chairs, pitchers, posters and automobiles, the other a mix of architectural models and drawings. With its stress on everyday objects, the design collection represents the core philosophy of the museum as it evolved in its early days: to extend modernism into the lives of ordinary people. As a 1949 museum Bulletin put it, ''Modern art is an intrinsic part of modern living.'' The new Modern, adopted already into the hearts and minds of New Yorkers, is itself the best proof how true that is. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  KIMMELMAN    'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Aveune, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 16. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. But the show highlights other important areas of his achievement, not least of them the products of his early days in Paris (1927-28) where he turned out a wonderful series of abstract drawings that integrate biomorphic and geometric shapes with line, signaling his embrace of modernist art. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, which are displayed in the last gallery. Hours and admission: see above.  GLUECK    * 'PERSONAL AFFECTS: POWER AND POETICS IN CONTEMPORARY SOUTH AFRICAN ART,' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700) and St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 111th Street, through Jan. 3 and Dec. 5, respectively. This two-part exhibition traces what its curators call a ''post-identity'' development in South African art since the end of apartheid, with issues of class, race and gender subsumed under other personal or abstract concerns. For the occasion, the museum commissioned new pieces from 17 artists, some specifically for the cathedral. The installation there is more than just effective. It's the strongest group show of new art anywhere in the city so far this season. But certain artists are seen to better advantage in the smaller-scale spaces of the Museum of African art itself. All in all, the show's two halves are forcefully complementary. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students and 65+.  COTTER    * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, a 14-piece pocketknife, silk doublets trimmed in silver and gold, a brass horn and several automatons, which move about on hidden mechanized wheels, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours and admission: see above.  KIMMELMAN    'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL,' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, through Feb. 6. The 40 artists here are all residents of the city's most cosmopolitan borough, though nearly a third were born outside the United States. In line with current curatorial trends, overt displays of ethnicity are played down and a certain blandness prevails. But there is some interesting work, including paintings by the Japanese-American Hideo Date, now 97 and a Queens citizen for more than half a century. His two soft-grained figurative paintings from the 1930's and 40's emanate from a distant stylistic world, one that looks fine right now. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 55+.  COTTER    'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, through July 10. Think of cave murals and Renaissance altarpieces used to contextualize examples of modern and contemporary painting and you've got the equivalent of this exhibition, a mixed bag of old and new, quality and special pleading. Here examples of jewelry and other small objects that date back to prehistoric times lend credence to late 20th and 21st century works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Enough recent efforts stand out to make the show a valuable essay on the very notion of traditions, how they are formed, perpetuated, renewed, exploited or exhausted. But claiming to follow the beliefs or crafts of one's ancestors does not guarantee a special purchase on spirituality. All art is essentially a faith-based initiative. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $13; children, $7.50; students and 62+, $10.  SMITH    Galleries: Uptown    BRYAN HUNT: 'AIRSHIPS,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through Dec. 11. Mr. Hunt became known in the mid 70's for beautiful sculptures in the form of miniature dirigibles made with balsa wood interior framing and paper skins covered with metal leaf or paint. Eight of these works, ranging in length from 40 to 64 inches, are on view here. Attached to the wall at one end, they hover mysteriously overhead.  KEN JOHNSON    ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although primarily thought of today as a realist painter, Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points.  GLUECK    * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism.  SMITH    A. R. PENCK: 'CONSTRUCTIONS,' Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Dec. 18. Mr. Penck's primitivistic paintings featuring stick figures and pictographic signs became internationally visible during the triumph of German Neo-Expressionism in the 1980's. This exhibition features something different: compact, slapdash constructions mostly from the early 70's made of found objects and materials like bottles, cardboard boxes, wire, fabric, tape and newspaper. Displayed on a single table that almost fills the gallery, they create a vaguely comical theater of the absurd.  JOHNSON    * 'PICASSO-BECKMANN/BECKMANN-PICASSO,' Richard L. Feigen, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 31. This wonderfully illuminating exhibition brings together two great 20th-century artists who are not ordinarily closely associated. It includes significant as well as interesting minor works by both. Picasso's colorful, thickly painted late-30's picture of a bull goring a horse is worth a visit all by itself, and so is Beckmann's ''Soldier's Dream'' from 1942, a darkly comical allegory of lust and death with bird-man and bird-woman lovers.  JOHNSON    'SO FAR SO CLOSE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM GUADALAJARA,' The Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 277-8343, through Jan. 21. This five-artist exhibition is intended to show that Mexico City is not the only scene of serious contemporary art in Mexico. It includes a Delftware motorcycle helmet by Agustin Solórzano; gold-glazed ceramic tacos by Luis Miguel Suro; an absorbing video showing puzzling crowd behavior by Gonzalo Lebrija; Fernando Palomar's mural-scale silhouette of a Dutch landscape; and Rem Koolhass's book ''S,M,L,XL'' cut up into four different size pieces by José Dávila.  JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    WAYNE THIEBAUD, 'JUST DESSERTS,' Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331, through Dec. 18. No one did more to reanimate the tired old genre of still life painting in the last half century than did Mr. Thiebaud with his paintings of industrially regimented food products. His prints, sampled here in a 50-year retrospective, are less exciting than his paintings. Most are in black and white and on the small side. But they still convey the artist's wry vision of modern consumerism with forthright graphic efficiency, and the full-color prints of cans of paint, a row of lipsticks and a white rabbit are lovely.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Dec. 4 . This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored-pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William S. Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff.  JOHNSON    CARMEN CICERO, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 226-1660, through Dec. 14. Mr. Cicero's cartoonish, easel-size narrative paintings combine humor, gothic mystery and Magritte-style surrealism. In some, men in trenchcoats and fedoras walk through landscapes of dreamlike desolation or drive old cars on nocturnal country roads; in others emblematic images like a knight's helmet or a locomotive hover like mystical signs. Mr. Cicero is not an Outsider -- he has been exhibiting his art since the early 50's and earned a M.F.A. degree in 1991 -- but his work has the hair-raising feeling of a self-taught visionary's.  JOHNSON    GEORGE GROSZ: 'NEW YORK DRAWINGS,' Nolan/Eckman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-6190, through Dec. 4. This fascinating exhibition presents a series of ink drawings made to illustrate a 1941 collection of writings by the journalist Ben Hecht called ''1001 Afternoons in New York.'' Grosz, who moved to New York in 1933, may have done his best work during his Weimar years, but this show of never-before-exhibited drawings shows he did not leave behind his extraordinarily prehensile draftsmanship or his incisively satiric imagination.  JOHNSON    * 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown.  COTTER    Galleries: Chelsea    SEONNA HONG: 'ANIMUS,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0979, through Dec. 4. This Los Angeles-based artist won an Emmy this year for her animation work on an episode of the television cartoon series ''My Life as a Teenage Robot.'' Her first solo gallery exhibition in New York presents retro-style illustrations beautifully painted on wood panels for a yet-to-be-published picture book about a little girl and a vicious black dog.  JOHNSON    RICHARD KERN/LILY VAN DER STOKKER, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through Dec. 11. These separate solo shows could be presented under the single title ''Innocence and Experience.'' Mr. Kern's voyeuristic, snapshot-style pictures of women -- staged using attractive models -- are uncommonly visceral instances of the so-called male gaze. Ms. van der Stokker's aggressively charming pastel-colored wall paintings of abstract blobs, cartoon flowers, plaid patterns and quirky texts project a childlike sweetness, wholesome family values and mischievous ironies.  JOHNSON    CILDO MEIRELES: 'DESCALA' AND 'STRICTU,' Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, through Dec. 4. Concerned with changing the spectator's role from passive to active, Mr. Meireles, a Brazilian environmental artist, offers a heavy-breathing account of how spaces can be used to control mind and body. On a wooden interrogation table in a dark room is a statement condemning societal authoritarianism. The viewer is invited to don handcuffs attached to a ball and chain while viewing the second work: flat ladders and runged poles line the walls of a smaller gallery, creating a handsome compositional surround, Mondrianlike in its reductive effect.  GLUECK    BEATRIZ MILHAZES: 'SUMMERTIME,' James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, through Dec. 4. This Rio de Janeiro-based painter continues to produce large abstractions that teeter on the divide between the expressive and the decorative. Ms. Milhaze layers radiating blossoms, target patterns, stripes, hearts, butterflies and peace signs onto gridded patchworks of rich color. With their sensuously textured, gold leaf-accented surfaces and neo-hippie exuberance the paintings promise but don't quite deliver something really over the top.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    * 'AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY: 1945-1980 [DEBATING MODERNISM],' Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, (718) 631-6396, through Jan. 13. Recently reopened after a two-year renovation, this gallery is being promoted as a showplace, and justly so: it looks spiffy and its opening show is an ambitous one that rethinks canonical accounts of American modernism. Gold-standard artists like Pollock are joined by less successful contemporaries, and Photo Realism, a movement until recently out of favor, is reconsidered. Is the show cohesive? No, but it's stimulating and fun, with some terrific underknown works by familiar artists.  COTTER    IAN HAMILTON FINLAY, UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 52nd Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 3. Mr. Finlay, a Scottish poet, artist, gardener and rebel, born in 1925, aches for the past and feels its impact on the present. His graphic works are inspired by the French Revolution, classical art and literature, boats, World War II and his renowned garden. An expert typographer, he often fashions images from words or combinations of letters alone, placing them in punchy arrangements. Best are his images of ships, which occasionally take wry turns. Type fanciers and concrete poetry buffs will have a picnic; others may want to take along a cryptograph to fathom his buried meanings.  GLUECK    'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life. COTTER    'JAMAICA FLUX: WORKSPACES AND WINDOWS,' Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, (718) 658-7400, through Jan. 8. Although some of the work in this ambitious show is in the gallery, much is embedded in the surrounding environment, a major shopping strip. A local branch of North Fork Bank yields sculptures on the themes of wealth and illusions. Street posters adapt corporate marketing strategies to ecourage the use of libraries. The collective called Center for Urban Pedagogy planted models for urban architecture among footwear displays in Sneaker Mart Plus, and the artist Liselot van der Heijden's places a pointedly edited version of George W. Bush's 2004 State of the Union address in a shop among tapes of speeches by Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  COTTER    ARCHIE RAND: 'THE 19 DIASPORA PAINTINGS,' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205, through Jan. 12. The mercurial Mr. Rand has created a series of canvases representing the Biblical history of Israel using imagery copied in a loose, colorful style from various sorts of adventure comic books. Each is captioned by Hebrew words of a traditional prayer. The paintings are unconvincing visually, but the effort to wed traditional religion and Postmodernist art is interesting.  JOHNSON    SITE, Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Dec. 4. A cool new addition to Madison Square Park is the ''Shake Shack,'' a fast-food kiosk designed by the architecture firm Sculpture in the Environment (SITE) that was founded in 1970 by James Wines. It is partly a Postmodern hot dog stand, partly green architecture with its vegetation-covered roof and partly a way to generate revenue for the park. The small show of models and drawings at Senior & Shopmaker gives some background on Mr. Wines's inventive and admirable effort to integrate form, function and environment.
