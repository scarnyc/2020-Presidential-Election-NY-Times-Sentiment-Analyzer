Some prisoners may be released early for completing drug or education programs. Part of the plan includes changing how the state handles parolees, many of whom, at the moment, return to prison on technical violations, according to criminal system experts. California is the only state that places all prisoners on parole at release, but now hundreds of low-level offenders will be released without close supervision from their parole officers. The effort represents a “seismic shift,” said Joan Petersilia, a criminologist at Stanford Law School and a longtime scholar of the state’s prisons. The prison system costs the state $8 billion annually, about 11 percent of the state budget.

On the game’s final play, with Notre Dame trailing by 7 and on the 4-yard line, Weis said that the intended Notre Dame receiver, Duval Kamara, slipped coming out of his turn. He said Kamara would have been open because U.S.C. had double-teamed Golden Tate.
