0," Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'AROUND THE BEND' Starring Michael Caine, Josh Lucas and Christopher Walken. Written and directed by Jordan Roberts (R, 85 minutes). This heavily padded, thinly conceived, well-meaning movie about four generations of men stars Josh Lucas as Jason, a single parent raising an only son, Zach (Jonah Bobo), and caring for his querulous, sickly grandfather, Henry (Mr. Caine). Decades earlier, Jason's father, Turner (Mr. Walken), had abandoned his son and delivered him into Henry's loving care. Then one day Turner materializes on the front door. Jason initially rejects his father, but because blood is thicker than water, if only in the fantasy worlds of mainstream fiction and self-help books, reconciliation looms. Will Jason learn to trust Turner? Will Turner explain why he abandoned Jason? Will Mr. Walken deliver one of his patented eccentric performances? Will the screenplay explain Mr. Caine's on-and-off Cockney accent? The answers, in order, are yes, yes, yes and no.   MANOHLA DARGIS    * 'CELLULAR' Starring Kim Basinger, Chris Evans and William H. Macy. Directed by David R. Ellis (PG-13, 89 minutes). In this improbable, improbably entertaining action thriller, a Los Angeles science teacher (Ms. Basinger) is kidnapped by a squad of baddies, who lock her in an attic with a telephone that works just well enough for her to connect, at random, with the cellphone of a surfer (Mr. Evans), who spends the rest of the movie trying to rescue her. In an age of self-important, bloated blockbusters, this movie, directed with breeziness and rigor by Mr. Ellis, is a refreshing rarity: an honest, unpretentious B picture, with enough decent jokes, crackerjack car chases and plot convolutions to make the price of the ticket seem like a reasonable bargain. Mr. Macy adds a wry, touching note as the weary L.A.P.D. veteran who helps the surfer in his effort to save the science teacher.   A. O. SCOTT    'A DIRTY SHAME' Starring Tracey Ullman and Johnny Knoxville. Written and directed by John Waters (NC-17, 89 minutes). A crashing bore is more like it. Mr. Waters's latest movie once again pits unruly, life-affirming sex maniacs against uptight prudes, here known as neuters. The line between them is blurry: the heroine, Sylvia Stickles (Ms. Ullman), starts out as a repressed suburban mother and, after suffering a concussion, goes on a libidinous rampage. She joins a sex-addict cult (led by Mr. Knoxville), which is devoted to discovering a hitherto undreamed-of kink that will unlock the erotic secrets of the universe. The movie, an anarchic catalog of perversions, sounds like more fun than it is, but Mr. Waters, after more than 35 years of moviemaking, remains a determined amateur, with little interest in acting, storytelling or visual creativity. If his jokes were still funny or his attitudes still provocative, the crudeness of the picture would be less bothersome, but the net effect of all the energetic naughtiness is like that of being in a room full of 8-year-old boys who have just learned some new swear words.   SCOTT    'THE FORGOTTEN' Starring Julianne Moore, Dominic West and Gary Sinise. Directed by Joseph Ruben (PG-13, 100 minutes). In this preposterous thriller, a pseudo-spiritual, mumbo-jumbo, sciencefiction-inflected mess, Mr. Ruben does not just fail to tap into the talent of his luminous star, Ms. Moore; he barely gets her attention. As Telly, a Brooklyn mother in mourning, Ms. Moore delivers a performance that has all the emotional commitment of a bored kid playing with a light switch. Even after Telly discovers that all the images of her dead son have been erased from the photographs scattered around her home, Ms. Moore keeps flipping the switch: sad, not sad, sad, not sad. Initially, the disappearing images are explained away by Telly's creepy psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Mr. Sinise), who insists that the boy never existed and that after suffering a miscarriage, she invented him out of thin air. Telly finds this hard to believe (she isn't the only one) and embarks on a Search for the Truth involving cheap thrills, emotional uplift and some nonsense about the eternal mother.   DARGIS    'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganze in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke, as the team's star runner, and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback.   SCOTT    * 'I   HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer up solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, says Mr. Russell, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I   Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope.   DARGIS    'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism.   DARGIS    * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc√≠a Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952, Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon.   SCOTT    'RAISE YOUR VOICE' Starring Hilary Duff. Directed by Sean McNamara (PG, 97 minutes). Ms. Duff, as Terri Fletcher, redefines the word ''pep.'' But when tragedy strikes her family, Terri loses her voice (her great joy is singing) and her love of life. The only thing that might snap her out of it would be attending a very hard to get into summer-music program in Los Angeles, but her hardheaded father (David Keith) objects. It takes deception and the help of a free-spirited aunt (Rebecca De Mornay) to get her there. Predictably, the big city lives up to its bad reputation at first, but chances are good that Terri will find her voice again, teach her parents a lesson and get the guy (Oliver James). Thinking adults won't find much of ''Raise Your Voice'' worth their time, but this piece of fluff's infectious high spirits will appeal to young moviegoers without conveying any sinister messages, beyond the suggestion that soul-crushing grief can be ''cured'' in the short space of a summer.   ANITA GATES    'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren√©e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale.   SCOTT    'SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW' Starring Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi. Written and directed by Kerry Conran (PG, 107 minutes). In this movie's elegant murk, Mr. Law and Ms. Paltrow slip into comic-book archetypes of the dashing aviator and the intrepid girl reporter with supreme confidence. But can the movie establish a swashbuckling franchise as commercially potent as the Indiana Jones movies? When Mr. Conran's remarkable filmmaking debut remembers that storytelling and characters matter more than design and special effects, the movie charms as well as impresses. If nothing else, it is a landmark of computer-generated images, with actors cavorting through an entirely synthetic, retro-styled future world that fuses Art Deco, Futurism, Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis'' and the spirit of the 1939 World's Fair into an all-purpose eve-of-World War II environment extrapolated into a science-fiction limbo. But its visual elegance comes at a price. Its ethereal evocation of a pulp-fiction future-past eclipses almost any other sci-fi franchise in subtlety and imagination, but shadowy washed-out color is a far cry from the robust hues of a movie like ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.''   STEPHEN HOLDEN    'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who speciallizes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a sludgy Sunday-brunch score and a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women.   SCOTT    'TAXI' Starring Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah. Directed by Tim Story (PG-13, 97 minutes). With his driver's license revoked, a New York cop (Mr. Fallon) teams up with a taxi driver (Queen Latifah) -- whose Yellow Cab has a supercharged engine under the hood -- to track down a gang of bank robbers, composed of leggy Brazilian models led by the leggy Brazilian model Gisele B√ºndchen. A tired, clich√©-ridden remake of a 1998 French production of the same name, Mr. Story's film ends abruptly, as if he'd walked out on his own picture -- something many viewers will be tempted to do as well.   DAVE KEHR    * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.   DARGIS    Pop/Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. CMJ shows are noted. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent pop and jazz performances: nytimes.com/music.    * MARC ANTHONY, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Marc Anthony pines for romance with one of the most ardent voices in pop: a tenor that starts out seeming hesitant and rises to pealing, sobbing notes that hold on to their gentleness even at full power. His songs in English have been more awkward than his salsa hits in Spanish. His most recent album, ''Amar Sin Mentiras'' (Sony), leans heavily on the ballads, but there's no denying his combination of boyish charm and supercharged supplication. Sunday night at 6; tickets are $99.50.   JON PARELES    CLAUDIA ACU√ëA, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street,West Village, (212) 255-3626. Ms. Acu√±a, a young jazz singer from Chile, is committed to the idea of a jazz singer as an inseparable part of the band -- or, better yet, as a bandleader. She is working with a great crop of New York musicians, and they play around with mambos, Middle Eastern scales and improvising that goes far beyond mere accompaniment. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.   BEN RATLIFF    * EVA AYLLON, TownHall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824. Afro-Peruvian music, which imported African rhythms into Spanish and Andean song, became popular in Peru during the 1970's and 80's, when many South American countries were discovering their cultural roots. Eva Ayllon is one of the best musicians to come out of it, a strong and outrageously good singer whose songs move between waltzes and the Afro-Peruvian rhythms called lando and festejo. Her music also has the dramatic temper of out-and-out romantic pop, and at the heart of her band are three drummers. Her repertory is filled with references to black and Peruvian pride; the first song on her new album, ''Eva! Leyenda Peruana'' (Times Square), is a semi-autobiographical lando called ''Negra Presuntuosa'' (''The Presumptuous Black Woman''). She is internationalizing herself; this is her first North American tour that isn't playing specifically to Peruvian communities. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25 to $45.   RATLIFF    * RAY BARRETTO 75th BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. After a long career playing with jazz and salsa bands and various other bands in between, the great conga player Ray Barretto will tell you that he plays jazz, full stop. But here he is, for a significant birthday-week gig, connecting with conga players who represent 60 years of Afro-Cuban roots music and Latin jazz: Candido Camero, Patato Valdes and Giovanni Hidalgo. Kenny Garrett, a jazz alto saxophonist who has nothing to do with Latin music per se, will be another guest. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $30 and there is a $5 minimum.   RATLIFF    CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN/CRACKER, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Camper Van Beethoven, the California band that played deadpan mixtures of folk-rock, reggae, klezmer and anything else its songwriters felt like toying with, spawned so many offshoots that the band itself may not be able to keep track of them. After leading Cracker for much of the 1990's, David Lowery reconvened Camper Van Beethoven, which has made a new album, ''New Roman Times'' (Pitch a Tent), that's a rock opera about a soldier. Camper and Cracker are both gathered tonight, with Johnny Hickmen of Cracker at 6:30, Cracker at 6:40, Jonathan Segel and Victor Krummenacher from Camper at 7:50 and Camper Van Beethoven at 8. A CMJ show; tickets are $15.   PARELES    BILLY COBHAM CULTURE MIX, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. Mr. Cobham, drummer extraordinaire for the old Mahavishnu Orchestra, long ago decided to use a wide canvas: jazz, rock and funk. This week he plays with a group that includes the percussionist Airto Moreira and the trumpeter Randy Brecker. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, and there is a $10 minimum.   RATLIFF    THE CRAMPS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The Cramps have been scrambling punk, goth, twang and B-movie memories into their own frenzied psychobilly music since the mid-1970's. Sunday night at 8, with the Chesterfield Kings and Dead Combo; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 Sunday.   PARELES    * DR. JOHN/SHEMEKIA COPELAND/CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE, Bardavon Opera House, 35 Market Street, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (845) 473-2072. Three very different takes on the blues. Dr. John is the growly-voiced New Orleans piano wizard who splashes barrelhouse flourishes over songs that could hold voodoo secrets. Shemekia Copeland sings in a gutsy but girlish voice about men and their many flaws, from indifference to infidelity. Charlie Musselwhite has been a celebrated harmonica player since the 1960's, and on his most recent album, ''Sanctuary'' (Real World), he lets his conversational voice contemplate memories and mortality before reaching for deep blues with his harmonica. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $42.50.   PARELES    ELIANE ELIAS, Le Jazz Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 308-9455. Ms. Elias, the Brazilian pianist who fuses the main line of postwar jazz with Latin American rhythms and song forms, has been one of the more interesting crosscultural musicians on the New York scene; her group can hit hard, escaping the languidness of so much Brazilian jazz. Sets are tonight at 8 and 10 and tomorrow night at 11; cover charge is $40.   RATLIFF    FANTCHA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Fantcha sings mornas, the lilting, wistful, piquantly mournful songs from the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Senegal. As a prot√©g√©e of the best-known Cape Verdean singer, Cesaria Evora, she has learned some of the secrets of morna's amiable melancholy. Tomorrow night at 10; tickets are $18 in advance, $20 tomorrow.   PARELES    DAVE FRISHBERG AND JAY LEONHARDT, Birdland, 131 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 581-3080. Two jazz performers with clever senses of humor, who have compiled a body of sly songs -- many of them about playing jazz and living the jazz life. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40 and there is a $10 minimum.   RATLIFF    'THE JAZZ MASTERS,' Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Flushing, Queens, (718) 463-7700. Barry Harris, Jimmy Heath, Percy Heath, Clark Terry, Benny Powell, Winard Harper -- all but Mr. Harper are among the most venerable living jazz musicians. A concert involving all six will involve bonhomie and some secrets of the old-school performance style. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30; $24 for members.   RATLIFF    * JIMMY EAT WORLD, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-5252. Jimmy Eat World was an early standard-bearer for emo, adding emotional and musical complications to punk-rock while never resisting a good hook. It's about to resist its next album, ''Futures'' (Interscope). Tonight at 8, with Robbers on High Street and the Oranges Band; tickets are $22.   PARELES    JON LANGFORD'S SHIP AND PILOT, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. Jon Langford of the Mekons brings one of his many side projects, Ship and Pilot, backing him as he bawls his way through songs full of history, surrealism and twang. Tonight at midnight, headlining a CMJ show that also includes Meat Purveyors at 11, the Fandanglers at 10, Carolyn Mark at 9 and the Cobble Hillbillies at 8; admission is $8.   PARELES    RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Malone, who played guitar with Diana Krall, brings the virtuosity of a stricter, older period in jazz; he can play a slow blues beautifully and then play ridiculously fast four-bar breaks. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25 tonight and tomorrow night, $20 on Sunday.   RATLIFF    * BETTE MIDLER, Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street, (212) 247-4777. This voracious, wildly energetic entertainer blows into town for two performances of ''Kiss My Brass,'' her clever, freewheeling current show. Shameless dirty jokes, tear-jerking ballads, sly political digs and -- of course -- mermaids in wheelchairs: she rarely seems any more (or any less) than half serious, even when she's crooning about that famous wind beneath those famous wings. (Has there ever been a more mean-spirited tribute to a friend?) Ms. Midler makes other, more single-minded performers seem stodgy by comparison. Tomorrow night and Sunday night at 8; tickets are $70 to $255.   KELEFA SANNEH    ALEXI MURDOCH/MIKE DOUGHTY, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Alexi Murdoch's songs seek quiet revelations, harking back to folky, introspective songwriters like Nick Drake and John Martyn. Mike Doughty, whose wisecracking neo-Beat rapped lyrics were the core of Soul Coughing, is on his own now, still droll and rhyming. A CMJ show, tomorrow night at 7, with Hotel Lights opening; admission is $12.   PARELES    DAVID FATHEAD NEWMAN QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. Mr. Newman, the saxophonist, is one of the figures who led jazz toward pop in the 1960's, as Ray Charles's right-hand man in Charles's band's greatest years and a maker of consistent solo records for Atlantic. He has maintained his smoothness, and he is also a master of the blues. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.   RATLIFF    ONE NIGHT WITH LITE, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, 7th Avenue at 32nd Street, (212) 465-6741. An eminently risible concert, sponsored by Lite 106.7 FM, starring Josh Groban, John Ondrasik of Five for Fighting and Celine Dion. (Wasn't she supposed to be safely sequestered in Las Vegas? And how could her high-carb ballads possibly qualify as ''lite''?) But if you should somehow find yourself in the Theater at Madison Square Garden tonight, take heart: the lineup includes the nimble and elegant country singer Martina McBride, who should easily steal the show, even though her music isn't ''lite'' at all. Tonight at 8; tickets are $79.50 to $354.50.   SANNEH    * OUTPUTMESSAGE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. An emerging electronic producer who has released a handful of suave but angular tracks, letting jagged, asymmetrical rhythms collide with fizzy bits of melody; expect to hear disjointed pop songs and dry rhythm tracks seeping out of his laptop. Tonight at 9, as part of the CMJ Music Marathon; tickets are $10.   SANNEH    * ERIC REED QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The pianist Mr. Reed has been working on increasingly sophisticated versions of small-group jazz over the last 10 years or so; he has written a ton of original compositions, with precise arrangements, in styles ranging from ragtime to gospel to uptempo swing. His band includes the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonist Seamus Blake, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Billy Drummond. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.   RATLIFF    STAN RIDGWAY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212  239-6200. A Hollywood film-noir sensibility runs through Stan Ridgway's rock songs, which are full of characters in trouble and smoky ambience. Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $25.   PARELES    SASHA, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. A top-dollar club night starring Sasha, a D.J. who pleases huge crowds without (for the most part) pandering to them: eschewing both the obvious and the unusual, he tops his steady, thumping beats with complicated electronic patterns that slowly decay and mutate. Tonight after 10, with D.J. Three; tickets are $40.   SANNEH    SINGAPORE SLING/LOW FLYING OWLS, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. Singapore Sling, a band from Iceland, has been listening to glam-rock and Jesus and Mary Chain; it's devoted to drones overlaid with late-night decadence. Low Flying Owls, from California, revive psychedelia with all its drones and feedback, adding a little punk bite. Tomorrow night, Low Flying Owls at 9:30 and Singapore Sling at 11:30, on a CMJ show with Looker at 7:30, Another Blue door at 8:30, Benzos at 10:30 and Viva K at 12:30 a.m.; admission is $10.   PARELES    SOCIAL DISTORTION, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Social Distortion came out of the Southern California punk explosion of the late 1970's and stuck around. By now, its buzzsaw chords and minor-key melodies have taken on a tinge of roots-rock, and Mike Ness has moved from singing about youthful frustrations to pondering adult choices and consequences. Tonight at 7, with two younger punk bands, Tiger Army and Explosions, opening; tickets are $30.   PARELES    SONIC BOOM'S E.A.R., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street between Richards and Columbia Streets, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007. Sonic Boom, formerly of Spacemen 3, loves the trippy sounds of echoes and distortion and the swoops of synthesizers and theremin; his Experimental Audio Research takes its time with long, abstract jams. Tomorrow night at midnight, on a CMJ bill with Landing at 10 and Paik at 9; admission is $10.   PARELES    * REGINA SPEKTOR/THE MENDOZA LINE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)  358-7503. Regina Spektor plays spare, precise piano and sings in the voice of a very wise child: one who knows about sex, guns, despair and euphoria. She can come across as a sly combination of Rickie Lee Jones, Meredith Monk and Bjork. The Mendoza Line brings touches of country to the disheveled collegiate-rock of Pavement, ending up somewhere near Wilco in the realm of tarnished roots-rock. Unlike Wilco, the Mendoza Line focuses on the ways relationships crumble, summing them up in lines like ''We're all in this alone.'' Tomorrow, with Ms. Spektor at 10 and the Mendoza Line at 11, preceded by Zykos at 8 and the Fontaine Toups at 9. A CMJ show; admission is $12.   PARELES    * SUFJAN STEVENS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Last year, this captivating singer-songwriter released ''Greetings From Michigan: The Great Lake State'' (Asthmatic Kitty), which he claimed was the first in a series of albums about all the states. Having completed 2 percent of his task, he switched directions and released the stripped-down ''Seven Swans'' (Sounds Familyre), a gorgeous, hushed CD full of glowing songs of love and faith. Tonight at 12:30 a.m., as part of the CMJ Music Marathon; tickets are $14.   SANNEH    * THE THERMALS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. This gleeful but squint-eyed punk trio bashes out deceptively simple songs, wriggling and wriggling as if trying to escape a very small box. Visit http://www.thethermals.com/videos.html to watch the addictive, low-concept video for ''How We Know,'' a recent single. Tomorrow night at midnight, at the Sub Pop Records CMJ Showcase, a sure-to-be-packed concert that also stars Low, the Helio Sequence, Frausdots and Sam Jayne; tickets are $12.   SANNEH    MARY TIMONY, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. Tonight at 10:15, on a CMJ bill that also includes Manhunter at 8, Food for Animals at 8:45, Channels at 9:30, El Guapo at 11 and Q and not U at midnight; admission is $12.   PARELES    * ROKIA TRAORE, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Rokia Traore, from Mali, has a voice that's both delicate and impassioned. Her songs are cat's-cradles of circling guitar lines, marimba patterns and rhythms tapped on a calabash; her new album, ''Bombwoi'' (Nonesuch) also uses a string quartet. Ms. Traore subtly updates traditional styles while holding to their intricate clarity. Tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $28 to $35.   PARELES    TV ON THE RADIO/SALLY TIMMS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. TV on the Radio is a New York art-rock band to the core, reaching back to the frenzied minimalism of the Velvet Underground and adding its own eerie, poetic overlay. Sally Timms, the longtime vocalist of the Mekons, has a matter-of-factly melancholy voice and a repertory that extends from quasi-country to the songs about masculinity from her new album, ''The World of Him'' (Touch and Go). Tonight, TV on the Radio at 12:45 and Ms. Timms at 9:30, along with Tara Jane O'Neil at 8, Whirlwind Head at 8:45. Battles at 10:20 and Pinback at 11:25. A CMJ show; admission is $22.50.   PARELES    THE TWILIGHT SINGERS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Greg Dulli led the Afghan Whigs before he started the more introspective Twilight Singers, who help him wallow in loneliness and romantic insecurity as he confesses all in his smoky voice. The group's new album, ''She Loves You'' (One Little Indian Us), is a collection of other people's songs, from Bjork to Mary J. Blige to Gershwin. Tomorrow night at midnight; tickets are $20.   PARELES    ADAM ROGERS QUARTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Mr. Rogers is easily one of the best jazz guitarists in New York, the next step in the tradition of swinging mainstream players -- in the line of Pat Martino and George Benson, though he can rock and play country as well. This weekend he appears with the pianist Edward Simon, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Clarence Penn. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15.   RATLIFF    VON BONDIES, Plaid, 76 East 13th Street, Manhattan, (212) 388-1060. Throwbacks and proud of it, the Von Bondies play garage-rock songs that are all riff and muscle: just three or four chords, a brawny beat, and something for Jason Stollsteimer to howl. Tonight at 11, in a CMJ show that also includes Idiot Pilot at 8, the Crimea at 8:45, the Sun at 9:30, Rolling Blackouts at 10:15 and Mean Reds at midnight. Admission: $25.   PARELES    THE FAINT -- This weekend, the CMJ Music Marathon invades the downtown nightclubs, bringing together enough indie-rockers from around the country to repopulate Williamsburg several times over. (Visit http://www.cmj.com/marathon/showcase.php for the full schedule.) The Faint, new-wave revivalists from Omaha, come to town to play two of the weekend's most eagerly anticipated concerts -- a CMJ showcase tonight and a concert tomorrow night that's not affiliated with the Marathon. The band's new album is ''Wet From Birth'' (Saddle Creek), an inventive, sometimes awkward CD driven by saw-toothed bass lines and flat, uneasy vocals. On ''How Could I Forget'' and ''Paranoiattack,'' the band explores a jagged, mutated version of house music, but elsewhere, the singer Todd Baechle often adds lyrics that are either too ridiculous or not ridiculous enough. (It's hard to tell; what's clear is that the phrase ''tunnel of mucus'' should never have been committed to tape.) Still, expect a propulsive, theatrical show, with the band members wobbling their knees in time to the beat as patterns and icons flicker on the huge screens behind them. (Tonight at 6 with the Good Life; Beep Beep; Son, Ambulance; and Broken Spindles. Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Tickets are $20; a limited number of CMJ badge holders will also be admitted. Tomorrow night at 7:30 with TV on the Radio and Beep Beep; tickets are $20, no CMJ badgeholders will be admitted.)   KELEFA SANNEH    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blas√© but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.   STEPHEN HOLDEN    ELIANE ELIAS, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212) 308-9455. The Brazilian pianist and singer Eliane Elias commands the keyboard with a forceful two-handed muscularity that belies her image as a blonde older sister of the mythical Girl From Ipanema. The more percussive her pianism becomes, the more she opens up a song and re-positions it in what might be called a romantic carnival groove. The more aggressively she and her band (Marc Johnson on bass, Rubens de la Corte on guitar and Paulo Braga on drums) rub up against the formal structures of pop samba, the better they sound. Tonight at 8 and 10:30 and tomorrow night at 11. Cover $40; no minimum.   HOLDEN    PHILLIP OFFICER, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. Mr. Officer is a font of optimism. Even when the storm clouds are dumping buckets of rain on his head, he would rather peer into the distance and discern the hazy outlines of a rainbow on the horizon. What keeps the singing of this light but steady baritone from becoming insistently cloying is his musicality and connoisseurship of songs from many decades, which he likes to weave into odd but smart combinations (e.g. Van Morrison's ''Moondance'' with Irving Berlin's ''Let Yourself Go''); Barry Levitt charges behind on piano. Sunday at 2 p.m. Cover: $20; two-drink minimum.   HOLDEN    SANDY STEWART AND BILL CHARLAP, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. There are moments when the singer Sandy Stewart resembles the great French actress Simone Signornet in her later years. Life's heartbreaks and tragedies have been absorbed and folded into a maternal persona that exudes comfort, wisdom and a humming serenity only rarely interrupted by moments of alarm. Her son, Mr. Charlap, who accompanies on piano and takes his own brief solo set, is a brilliant jazz whiz who shares his mother's no-frills sense of musical discretion. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $50; $50 prix-fixe dinner requred at the early shows; two drink-minimum at the late shows.   HOLDEN    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'AIDA' The character's an innocent teenage maiden, but the role requires a voice that can run the gamut from limpid to stentorian, all at considerable volume. By the end of the evening it's usually pretty clear who's won: tomorrow night's contender, taking on Verdi's Ethiopian slave girl in the Metropolitan Opera revival, is Fiorenza Cedolins. She's appearing with other singers capable of mighty if not always accurate sounds, Franco Farina (as Radam√®s) and Juan Pons (as her father Amonasro); while the redoubtable Dolora Zajick will reprise one of her signature scene-stealing Verdi mezzo roles, Amneris. Marcello Viotti conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $40 to $215.   ANNE MIDGETTE    'LA BOH√àME' You can do almost anything to Puccini's best-loved opera -- even move it to the East Village (see ''Rent''). James Robinson's production at City Opera doesn't go that far; but it does nudge the action up to the eve of World War I, so that Grant Youngblood's full-bodied Marcello adorns the walls of the Bohemians' garret with bright Fauve-like colors, and Colline (Matthew Burns) demonstrates against the war. In this revival (which ends its run tonight), Jorge Antonio Pita's Rodolfo sounds strained; Angela Marambio is a warm Mimi, and, although the production has lost some of its starch over the years, Mimi's death remains an effective tear-jerker. Steven White conducts. Tonight at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27.50 to $105.50.   MIDGETTE    'CARMEN' Over the years, Bizet's gritty op√©ra-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers especially from bloat and stiffness, dealing in archetypes rather than living, breathing figures. Some extra motion comes into the picture tomorrow as new singers step into the lead roles: Maria Domashenko takes on Carmen, and Fabio Armiliato sings Don Jos√©. An additional tenor joins the cast, but in the pit: Pl√°cido Domingo, tending his second (or is it third) career as a conductor. Rounding out the cast are Hei-Kyung Hong, a lyrical Mica√´la, and the worthy newcomer Ildar Abdrazakov as Escamillo. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.   MIDGETTE    'DIALOGUES OF THE CARMELITES' The New York City Opera's new production of Poulenc's tragic opera continues its run at the New York State Theater. From a career of composing filled with the shrewd, the witty, the tender and the generally lighthearted, Poulenc has also left us this deeply serious opera and the questions it asks about faith and revolution. Definitely worth a trip. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50.   BERNARD HOLLAND    'FALSTAFF' Diminutive it may be, but you can't say it's not ambitious: the Dicapo Opera, in an underground theater in a church basement, is staging Verdi's final opera, a comic masterpiece that happens to be fiendishly difficult, as its first production of this season. Just to make it more difficult, Michael Capasso, the company's co-founder, is updating the action to Brooklyn and evoking the spirit of 1950's sit-coms: such updating either works or really, really doesn't. Amanda Winfield, David Malis and Richard Byrne lead the cast; Pacien Mazzagatti conducts. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Sunday afternoon at 4, Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, (212) 288-9438. Tickets: $47.50.   MIDGETTE    * 'PLAT√âE' There is an element of meanness in Rameau's ''Plat√©e,'' the French baroque com√©die-lyrique, which has returned to the New York City Opera in Mark Morris's enchanting production. Mr. Morris, who directed and choreographed the work, does not shy away from the cruelty in the story, which surely is just as Rameau intended. To teach his jealous wife Juno a lesson, Jupiter pretends to fall in love with Plat√©e, a homely, part-amphibian marsh nymph who carries on like the grand dame of the swamp creatures. As costumed by Isaac Mizrahi, Plat√©e may look ridiculous, with her frog skin, webbed feet and hands, and a sagging breast and tummy disguised by a sheer greenish gown. But as played by the diminutive and riveting tenor Jean-Paul Fouch√©court, Plat√©e is an endearing diva. It's funny, yes, but heartbreaking to see her so blithely duped. The winning cast includes members of the Mark Morris Dance Group, wildly costumed as frogs, snakes, nymphs and such. Daniel Beckwith conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50.   ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'LA TRAVIATA' Verdi's drama is so well written that a singer who can manage to get through the difficult title role is virtually guaranteed a success. At City Opera, Maria Kanyova attacks Violetta with a will and negotiates the role's hurdles with a kind of fierce vivacity, down to a brief but solid high E-flat at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in Act I. She's joined tomorrow by some new men in her life: Grant Youngblood, who should be a fine strong Germont, and Eric Fennell as Alfredo. The matinee will also mark the company debut of a young conductor named Ari Pelto. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50.   MIDGETTE    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA When Bruno Walter (born in 1876) and Hans Pfitzner (born 1869) were leading young figures in German music, each was a composer and a conductor. Walter left composing behind as conducting took over his life. Eventually Walter left Pfitzner behind as well when he emigrated to America, never forgiving his former colleague for his Nazi sympathies. ''A Complicated Friendship'' is the title of the program Leon Botstein will conduct tonight in which this relationship is explored. Performances of Pfitzner's ''Palestrina'' Preludes and his Violin Concerto (with Alexander Markov as soloist) will be followed by the first performance in half a century, according to Mr. Botstein, of Bruno Walter's Symphony No. 1, which dates from 1907. Tonight at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53.   TOMMASINI    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight, the pianist Olga Vinokur offers an all-Russian program of works by Tchaikovsky, Scriabin, Medtner and others. Tomorrow night and Sunday will bring chamber music programs, including Smetana's smoldering G-minor Trio and Cindy McTee's ''Circle Music I,'' a work designed like a choose-your-own-adventure novel with the performers deciding individually which route to take through the music. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $20.   JEREMY EICHLER    LEONARDO CAPALBO As part of its important work supporting young singers in recital appearances across the United States, the Marilyn Horne Foundation offers a series of intimate and popular voice recitals in New York. This season's series begins on Sunday afternoon with the tenor Leonardo Capalbo, a graduate of Juilliard and the Music Academy of the West (where he studied with Ms. Horne). Mr. Capalbo, who enjoyed recent success in appearances with Opera North in England, will perform songs by Bellini, Mascagni, Liszt, Quilter and others, accompanied by the pianist Jonathan Kelly. Sunday at 3 p.m., the Chapel at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue and 50th Street, (212) 378-0248. Tickets: $20,$15 for 65+ and free for students   TOMMASINI    * FLOATING WORLDS: GEORGE CRUMB/FERNANDO VELAZQUEZ With its striking colors, bold gestures and brilliant use of extended instrumental techniques, George Crumb's music has always invited a level of visual engagement. So perhaps it's not surprising that a contemporary painter has accepted the invitation. The London-based artist Fernando Velazquez has responded to Mr. Crumb's music with an 8-by-12-foot painting that will be presented for the first time this evening as accompaniment to an all-Crumb program performed by the enterprising International Contemporary Ensemble and the soprano Tony Arnold. Among the works featured will be the ''Vox Balaenae'' (1971), inspired by whale song, and a more recent solo piano work ''Eine Kleine Mitternachtmusik.'' Tonight at 8:30, Thalia Theater, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $21; $18 for students and 65+.   JEREMY EICHLER    WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR If, for whatever reason, Lincoln Center declares it a Brahms season, it's a Brahms season. The big guns will be the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and the Dresden Philharmonic in the four symphonies. But the Great Performers series ''The Classical Romantic'' begins more modestly with the excellent Austrian baritone Wolfgang Holzmair presenting an array of Brahms songs, including some of the exquisite settings of German folk songs, too seldom heard. As in all Brahms songs, Russell Ryan, the pianist, will play a crucial role. Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $48.   JAMES R. OESTREICH    GREAT MUSIC FOR A GREAT CITY One measure of a city's greatness may be the amount of free music available on any given night, and in those terms, New York scores high, especially with all the concerts at local conservatories. Even so, this free series in Midtown is a welcome addition to the city's wallet-friendly offerings. Many of its fall concerts are devoted to American music, including tomorrow night's program of works by Gershwin, Ellington, Copland and Bernstein. Tomorrow night at 7:30, CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, (212) 817-8215. Free; paid reservations are available.   EICHLER    GUARNERI STRING QUARTET This ensemble, founded in 1964 and long a pillar of the American chamber music world, has been renovating its sound in recent years. When the group's original cellist, David Soyer, retired in 2001, the remaining players -- the violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John Dalley and the violist Michael Tree --- brought in the cellist Peter Wiley, who, though considerably younger, had a broad range of chamber music experience. Any personnel change in a chamber ensemble of long standing will inevitably have an effect on the group's energy, and so far the results have been promising. On Saturday, Guarneri players are also likely to draw some electricity from Peter Serkin, who joins the group for Dvorak's Piano Quintet in A. The program also includes Mozart's String Quartet in B flat (K. 589) and Frank Bridge's String Quartet No. 1. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $45.   ALLAN KOZINN    EMMA KIRKBY AND FRETWORK The recital series at the Frick Collection offers a broad range of repertory, but early music played on period instruments has long been one its strengths. Fretwork, an English viola da gamba quintet that has made some superb recordings, is presenting a program of works by English composers, among them Taverner, Dowland, Byrd, Gibbons, Wilbye and Purcell. All wrote magnificent consort works, but they also contributed some of the most magical music in the English vocal repertory. The soprano Emma Kirkby, whose recordings of Dowland and Purcell songs are incomparable, will join the group to offer a sampling. Sunday at 5, Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. Free, but tickets are required.   KOZINN    MAURIZIO POLLINI The Italian pianist Maurizio Pollini takes his music seriously, and he often takes it on the road. On Sunday he makes one of his regular calls at Carnegie Hall, and as usual his repertory rarely strays far from Chopin. The first half of this recital brings familiar favorites, including the Third Ballade and the B-flat minor Sonata. The 12 Preludes, Book II, of Debussy come after intermission: music whose seeming haze and indeterminacy hides a musical mind of great precision. Mr. Pollini's elegance and respect for texts should make the second half more interesting than the first. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $27 to $97.   HOLLAND    'RUDDIGORE' For outlandish plot twists and clever complications, this 10th operetta in the Gilbert and Sullivan canon is not quite at the level of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' or ''The Pirates of Penzance.'' Still, the most crucial Savoyard trademarks are there, from romantic mixups and light strains of social satire, to catchy chorus and inspired silliness. Albert Bergeret's New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, founded in 1974, has this repertory virtually to itself. Normally, Mr. Bergeret conducts the company's productions, but for this staged concert version, he will turn over the baton to Jan Holland, and will sing the role of Richard Dauntless. The cast also includes Del Bourree Bach, Richard Holmes, Stephen O'Brien, Megan Friar, Victoria Devany and Elizabeth Hillebrand. Sunday at 3 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $41 to $51.   KOZINN    RIVERSIDE CHURCH CARILLON In 1991, on a gorgeous summer Sunday, I went to review a recital on the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon at Riverside Church and -- amid the noise from boom-boxes, traffic and general neighborhood mayhem -- heard next to nothing. Now Milford Myhre, a renowned carillonneur, applies his hand (more properly, his fists) to the huge instrument, and he may have a fighting chance of being heard. This recital celebrates the reopening of the instrument after a five-year refurbishment, presumably including improvements in the church tower to give the sound surer direction and better projection toward street level. Sunday at 1 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 870-6784. Free outdoor listening in the area.   OESTREICH    WARSAW PHILHARMONIC Town Hall used to be a hot spot for debuts, so it is somehow appropriate that Antoni Wit makes his New York debut as music director of the Warsaw Philharmonic there. On the other hand, what will a big international orchestra sound like in fairly intimate confines? Brahms's First Symphony should pack a wallop. The program also includes Krzysztof Penderecki's ''Polymorphia'' and Chopin's First Piano Concerto, with Olga Kern as soloist. Ms. Kern, a co-winner of the Van Cliburn competition in 2001, made a big impression at Zankel Hall in May: big enough that she was invited into Carnegie Hall soon after to substitute for an ailing Krystian Zimerman. Sunday at 3 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824. Tickets: $15 to $35.   OESTREICH    NATHANIEL WEBSTER An impressive baritone voice, programming that's both intriguing and appealing and smart career-building: these are all nice attributes for a young singer to have, and Mr. Webster seems to have them. In his Carnegie Hall recital debut tonight, he offers songs with a wide range of folk and popular overtones, from Schumann settings of Robert Burns to Gershwin's ''Oh, Lady Be Good!'' The program also includes Purcell, Ravel, Wolf and a final set of rather disparate ''contemporary'' songs in English, from Bernstein to Rufus Wainwright to a single song from Ned Rorem's 9/11 cycle ''Aftermath,'' which Mr. Webster sang at its premiere and has kept in his repertory. His accompanist is Peter Murphy. Tonight at 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $32.   MIDGETTE    IAN BOSTRIDE AND LEIF OVE ANDSNES Few song cycles are as wrenching and powerful as ''Winterreise,'' Schubert's bleak portrait of a lovelorn young man who leaves his town, on foot, on a winter's night. The texts, drawn from the final part of Wilhelm M√ºller's ''Poems From the Posthumous Papers of a Traveling Horn Player,'' capture the protagonist's changing emotional state, from disappointment and nostalgia to brief flowerings of self-deceived hopefulness, and back through multiple shades of despair. But it is Schubert's music -- both his shapely vocal lines and his evocative, almost pictorial piano writing -- that gives M√ºller's scenes their flesh and blood. Ian Bostridge (above right), a young English tenor, has established himself in recent years as an astute and sensitive lieder singer with a particular affinity for Schubert. Among his current projects is a series of Schubert recordings with the Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, who proves a thoroughly sympathetic collaborator. The latest installment, as it happens, is a recording of ''Winterreise'' in which youthfulness and world-weariness are finely balanced. Given that Mr. Bostridge has generally proved even more affecting live than on disc, his concert version should not be missed. (Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $25 to $84.)

BAX GRANT SHOWCASE PERFORMANCE The little engine that could of dance institutions, the Brooklyn Arts Exchange has encouraged some very good young modern-dance choreographers to spread their wings in free rehearsal sessions. The results will be seen in dances and performance pieces by Zina Camblin, Catherine Dill and Alyse Rothman this weekend and in programs in mid-November. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 832-0018 or www.bax.org. Tickets: $15.   JENNIFER DUNNING    COMPAGNIE 111 AND PHIL SOLTANOFF A French dance troupe from Toulouse and a New York director collaborate on ''Plan B,''a mixed-media production that sets dancers balancing and tilting on an ever-shifting topsy-turvy plane that they try to conquer with the aid of kung-fu fighting, bungee cords, Velcro suits and suction cups. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New Victory Theater, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $10 to $30.   JACK ANDERSON    COMPANHIA PORTUGUESA DE BAILADO CONTEMPOR√ÇNEO From Portugal, the Companhia will make its North American debut in the Martha Graham-trained Vasco Wellenkamp's ''Amaram√°lia Abandono,'' an evocation of the Portuguese fado and Am√°lia Rodrigues, one of the most famous interpreters of this style of folksong. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $38.   DUNNING    EVERETT DANCE THEATER In ''Home Movies,'' company members put their family histories onstage in a 75-minute production in which true stories are choreographically told, cut up, intertwined and connected in an attempt to comment on life in a multicultural world. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $20.   ANDERSON    BIMBAVATI DEVI & COMPANY Ms. Devi, who teaches at the Manipuri Nartanalaya institution in India, is touring the United States with her dancers in lecture-performance programs on the devotional Manipuri style of Indian dance. Tomorrow at 4 p.m, Lotus Music and Dance Studios, 109 West 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 627-1076 ext. 16 or www.lotusarts.com. Tickets: $15; $12 students and 65+.   DUNNING    DURA MATER Kriota Willberg founded the company, whose name translates to ''tough mother,'' and her new ''The Bentfootes'' sounds as interestingly oddball. The piece tells the story of an American family of dancers from 1796 to today, incorporating recreations of period dances. It also asks the question: How could anyone be in the dance business for 200 years and not be famous? Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org. Tickets: $12; $10 for students and 65+.   DUNNING    'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85.   DUNNING    KITT JOHNSON Although Kitt Johnson heads a company called X-act in Copenhagen, this Danish choreographer has also achieved acclaim as a solo performer. In ''The Mirror'' she depicts an individual's quest to realize herself, and her complex solo journey toward self-perception takes place with the aid of mirrored reflections, some of which are only sporadically legible. Tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.   ANDERSON    ISABEL GOTZKOWSKY AND FRIENDS Ms. Gotzkowsky's work has been described as theatrically assertive. Here, this German-born modern-dance choreographer presents dances that address public and private worlds as well as loss, memory and the stillness of isolation in a dance inspired by the terrorist attacks of 9/11. In a third piece, four women interact with five set elements. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793 ext 11. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+ with identification.   DUNNING    HELLENIC FESTIVAL This ambitious festival focuses on the impact of ancient and classical Greek culture on contemporary thinking and art. The dance component begins this weekend with a performance by the Greek-American Folklore Society. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Bruno Walter Auditorium, New York Public Library of the Performing Arts, Lincoln Center, Manhattan, (212) 870-1630 or www.nypl.org. Free.   DUNNING    KOOSIL-JA In her new mixed-media ''deadmandancing Excess,'' the choreographer formerly known as Kumiko Kimoto examines the fear and fantasy of dying. The set includes dozens of television monitors and the media includes film, specifically footage from movie death scenes. It all sounds pretty grim, but this Bessie Award-winning choreographer often offers new perspectives on the great themes. Tonight and tomorrow night (and Thursday through next Saturday nights) at 9, Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 375-0186. Tickets: $15.   DUNNING    HENNING RUBSAM'S SENSEDANCE Melissa Morrissey, Akua Parker, Sonny Robinson and Ramon Thielen, of Dance Theater of Harlem, are guest artists in a program featuring three premieres. Mr. Rubsam introduces dances on point into his repertory with ''Chorale,'' a work for three couples that features unusual partnering to an original score by Ricardo Llorca, and ''Django,'' a tribute to the jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. ''Herman Sherman'' is a virtuosic solo by Shizu Yasuda set to Woody Herman's music. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 868-4444. Tickets: $22 and $30.   ANDERSON    * STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow (and Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 20) at 7 p.m.; Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 21) at 3 p.m. S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15.   DUNNING    WHITE WAVE 2004 D.U.M.B.O. DANCE FESTIVAL More than 85 companies and choreographers and more than 350 dancers will perform in a series of marathons featuring work by new and newly familiar dance artists -- like Tina Croll, Tom Pearson, Sue Bernhard, Zvi Gotheiner and Young Soon Kim. We can't vouch for the general level of the choreography and performance, but if this festival is anything like the neighborhood it celebrates, the results should be yeasty. Tonight from 7 to 10; tomorrow from 2 to 4 p.m., 5 to 7 p.m. and 8 to 10 p.m.; Sunday from 4 to 7 p.m, White Wave John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street at the waterfront, Brooklyn. There will also be an outdoor performance on Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m. at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, on the waterfront, between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, (718) 855-8822 or www.whitewavedance.com. Free, but donations are encouraged.   DUNNING    Theater    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Broadway    * 'AVENUE Q' (Tony Award winner for best musical, original score and book of a musical). The inspired brainchild of the songwriters Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx, this canny toy chest of a musical takes its stylistic cues from ''Sesame Street,'' from its cheery urban set to its singing puppets of assorted colors and dispositions. And in doing so it becomes the first mainstream musical since ''Rent'' to coo with such seductive directness to theatergoers on the fair side of 40 in their own language, in which irony is less a mind-set than a loosely worn style. Directed by Jason Moore, with a book by Jeff Whitty, the show applies the coaxing, learning-is-fun attitude of children's educational television to the R-rated situations of postcollegiate life in the big city. Featuring a pitch-perfect ensemble of live performers and oversize hand puppets, ''Avenue Q'' is to ''Sesame Street'' what Mel Brooks's ''Producers'' is to vintage Broadway musicals: a connoisseur's tribute to what it only seems to send up (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 and $96.25, with a limited number of $21.25 rush tickets available by lottery at the theater at 5:30 p.m. for the evening show and at 11:30 a.m. for the matinee.   BEN BRANTLEY    + ''DRACULA, THE MUSICAL'' And here it is, looming like a giant stuffed bat on a stick, the easiest target on Broadway. This show, which sets the familiar tale of old snaggletooth to the familiar music of Frank Wildhorn, bristles with all the animation, suspense and sex appeal of a Victorian waxworks in a seaside amusement park. Take your shots. Say something, if you must, about toothlessness or bloodlessness or the kindness of hammering stakes into the hearts of undead shows. But you may concede that it isn't much fun to trash something so eminently trashable. ''Dracula, the Musical,'' which features a book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton and is directed by Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''), isn't simply bad, which is an aesthetic state of being that is kind of fun if you're in the right mood. It is bad and boring. Among the talents wasted here are Melissa Errico, Kelli O'Hara, Stephen McKinley Henderson and, looking like a butler's butler in the title role, Tom Hewitt (2:10). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6000. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25.   BRANTLEY    *+ 'I AM MY OWN WIFE' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Mois√©s Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (n√© Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives Among the play's resonant assertions is that lives themselves are narratives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show.   BRUCE WEBER    Off Broadway    *+ 'GUANT√ÅNAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: You are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire, like Tim Robbins's Bush-bashing ''Embedded'' (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60.   BRANTLEY    * 'HEDDA GABLER' Ivo van Hove's strange, and strangely enthralling, new production of Ibsen's much-mounted drama about a dangerously frustrated housewife may not necessarily illuminate the play as a dramatic text. His sights are set considerably higher: he is an artist seeking, as Ibsen once did, to illuminate the world around him. The set, designed by his longtime collaborator Jan Versweyveld, is not a reasonable representation of the handsome, expensively appointed home spoken of more than once in the course of the play; the empty, echoing space represents an interior landscape, the cold, underpopulated expanses of Hedda's mind. In a performance that is a major achievement for this adventurous actress, Elizabeth Marvel evokes this process with captivating clarity, tracing the disjointed trajectory of an intellect devouring itself. The rest of the cast is also superb (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.   CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'LAST EASTER' The unofficial anthem of Bryony Lavery's abrasively sentimental comedy is Irving Berlin's ''Easter Parade.'' But as you watch this tale of a terminally ill lighting designer and her terminally madcap friends, you may think of another Berlin standard, the one in which theater folk are hymned for being able ''to smile when they are low.'' The author, who made a smashing New York debut this year with ''Frozen,'' chronicles an antic trip to Lourdes undertaken by June (Veanne Cox), a lighting designer with second-stage cancer, and her three best friends. They all face down doom with the typically British stiff upper lip, though here it acquires a curl of flashy bravado. The attitude is adorned with bright, shrink-wrapped eccentricities and desperate jokes. Directed by Doug Hughes, the cast members are as winsomely brittle as the script demands that they be. But the pained, reflective lyricism at the play's center is overwhelmed by its brave, quippy flippancy (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theatre, 121 Christopher Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 p.m.. Tickets: $60; $15 student rush tickets available 30 minutes before performances.   BRANTLEY    * 'MRS. FARNSWORTH' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. Though it deals with revelations that are the stuff of smear campaigns, ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth,'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. As delivered by Ms. Weaver, this turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60.   BRANTLEY    'RICHARD III' Ascending the throne has never been more of a struggle for Shakespeare's most Machiavellian monarch than it is in this production. Peter Dinklage (of the film ''The Station Agent''), who portrays the title character, is 4 foot 5 inches, and the throne of England was obviously designed with a taller man in mind. That means that for this Richard, physically placing himself in the seat of power requires strenuous and gymnastic exertions, an image that would be comic except for the determination and harsh sense of absurdity with which he invests it. And once this Richard is seated, he owns that throne. The hard blue ice of his eyes is enough to deflect any challenge. It is even almost enough to make you forget the overheated amateurishness of the show. Peter DuBois's production doesn't drag, but its high spirits are those of an overcaffeinated adolescent, all flailing limbs and whooping voice. See it, though, for Mr. Dinklage's refreshingly direct and purposeful Richard, whose fierce, effortful will power translates into extraordinary charisma (2:45). Public Theater, 525 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at noon; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50.   BRANTLEY    + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns led by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is, as Mr. Polunin, with his baggy yellow romperlike costume, his red ball of a nose, his tufts of white hair and his shaggy red bulbous shoes, teams with his cutup colleagues. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90.   LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    + 'STRING OF PEARLS' It's that old one-object-through-the-years gimmick, but Michele Lowe's one-act drama makes it fresh, funny and poignant. The stellar four-woman cast includes Ellen McLaughlin, the Tony Award-winning angel from ''Angels in America,'' and Mary Testa, the Tony-nominated alcoholic voice teacher from ''On the Town.'' Along with Antoinette LaVecchia and Sharon Washington, they create more than two dozen characters in a highly satisfying, often hilarious blend of sex, satire and absurdism, with an emphasis on women's relationships and the inevitability of both loss and happiness. The play, directed with knowing sparkle by Eric Simonson, is the tale of a necklace bought by a New York man for his wife just before he dies, its loss and its travels over the next three decades. That involves a lot of women, including a divorced landlady who is kind to a woman with cancer, a Tunisian hotel housekeeper with a greedy husband, a Riverside Drive swimmer who pretends not to be rich and a 300-pound lesbian gravedigger. Even the minor characters are memorable (1:30). Primary Stages at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.   ANITA GATES    + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker magazine, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and the inimitable Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.   BRANTLEY    Last Chance    'THE BALD SOPRANO' AND 'THE LESSON' Works of art have a way of regaining currency as the years pass. The Romanian-born Eug√®ne Ionesco, writing in 1950, surely did not envision the 21st-century American political landscape, but his ''Bald Soprano,'' a dark comedy about the vacuity of language, seems eerily apposite today. This is true despite the flaws in Carl Forsman's production, which domesticates and slightly sentimentalizes Ionesco's corrosive vision, generating plenty of silly humor but failing to penetrate to the play's icy core. In ''The Lesson,'' the problem doesn't arise, since this more macabre comedy is clear-cut, at least in its emotional dynamics. It, too, could easily be seen by the politically minded as a grim cautionary tale for today. Beneath the play's preposterous comic surfaces, Ionesco makes unsettling connections between the corruption of means of communication and the unleashing of man's basest, most violent instincts; he seems to suggest that the destruction of language leads inexorably to the destruction of life. The new translations by Tina Howe are clever, crisp and generally similar to previous versions (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50.   ISHERWOOD    'ROSE RAGE' This is not, as you might imagine, a comedy about dueling florists. It's a hefty slab of Shakespeare: all three parts of ''Henry VI,'' trimmed of fat and put through a meat grinder, then garnished with generous doses of directorial panache. A freshly sharpened cleaver is the weapon of choice in Edward Hall's flashy, eminently accessible production, which presents 15th-century England as a slaughterhouse doing big business. The three plays are compressed into less than four hours of stage time. (With a generous dinner break and two intermissions, ''Rose Rage'' requires about five and a half hours.) The overriding metaphor, equating war with butchery, is manifested in various arresting ways. A cleaver snaps down on a jiggling pile of organ meat, signifying the fated end of an earl. Globs of flesh drip from plastic bags flung up on meat hooks. Red cabbages, symbolizing traitorous heads, are splintered beneath wooden clubs. But metaphors are by their nature limiting, and Mr. Hall's has worn a bit thin by the end of the long evening. More problematic: Characters emerge only in broad outline here, and a real sense of humanity is largely missing from the production (5:30). The Duke on 42nd Street Theater, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tonight and tomorrow night at 6; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $75.   ISHERWOOD    KRISTIN LINKLATER ''Hecuba'' seems to be this season's Greek tragedy of choice, on both sides of the Atlantic. This fall London is host to not one but two productions of Euripides' tragedy, with Clare Higgins (''Vincent in Brixton'') and Vanessa Redgrave playing the role of the captive Trojan queen. Here, in a production running through Oct. 30 at 45 Bleecker Street Theater, the role has been undertaken by Kristin Linklater (above foreground). Ms. Linklater's name may not have the box-office ring of a Redgrave, but she's an immensely revered figure in the acting community, renowned for her voice coaching. The author of the book ''Freeing the Natural Voice,'' she's currently the head of acting at Columbia University's theater department. The list of boldface-worthy actors she's worked with includes Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Bernadette Peters and Alfre Woodard. But even a natural voice as studiously freed as Ms. Linklater's presumably has been might be challenged by the role of Hecuba. She begins the play in despair, a prisoner of the Greeks in the aftermath of the Trojan War. Her anguish turns to rage when her daughter Polyxena is led off to be sacrificed by Odysseus. But wait, there's more! Before the play's conclusion Hecuba will also see the body of a son brought before her, setting the stage for a sanguinary finale. Even Ms. Linklater may want to keep a bag of throat lozenges handy. (This weekend's schedule: tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 7 p.m., 45 Below, at 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. Tickets: $15.)   CHARLES ISHERWOOD    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through Nov. 13. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off camera. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3.   KEN JOHNSON    * 'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This enlightening, quietly excellent show is the first to juxtapose the design efforts -- his furniture, her textiles -- of two remarkable artists who happened to be married to each other. Instead of Josef's paintings of glowing nesting squares, which presage Minimalism, we get his 1927 nesting tables with the same meticulous sense of color, proportion and geometry that he would later apply to canvas. Anni brought a similarly intelligent structure to fabrics and tapestries that make every thread, texture and color count, at once exposing and exalting her medium's basic grid. She was the Sol LeWitt of weaving. Reflecting design moving toward art by dint of formidable concentration on its own purposes and potentials, this show may rearrange some ideas about early modernist design as well as Minimalist art and furniture. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7.   ROBERTA SMITH    * 'AUSTRIA WEST: NEW ALPINE ARCHITECTURE'' AND ''NEW ALPINE RESIDENCES,' Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through Oct. 30. An exciting survey of more than 70 structures -- from hotels to factories -- produced by what amounts to a thriving school of young architects working in the Austrian provinces of Tirol and Vorarlberg. Their historical pedigree reaches back to the International Style and the Bauhaus but has been relaxed by postmodernism and inspired by recent advances in building materials, techniques and systems. Nothing helps the new Alpine architecture like the grandeur of the old Alpine landscape, but this show confirms the point so often lost on American builders: that elegance, sustainability, innovation and respect for the environment are not antithetical. A show within a show of 40 residences by the same architects reflects more intimate applications of their ideas. One can come away with the inspiring realization that old history can be taught new tricks, and that even in these global, postmodern, pluralistic times, there can still be such a thing as a coherent style that accommodates individual sensibilities. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free.   SMITH    * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely rivetting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel short-changed. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.   HOLLAND COTTER    * 'COLONIAL ANDES: TAPESTRIES AND SILVERWORK, 1530-1830,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Dec. 12. This sumptuous, groundbreaking show examines the fruitful cultural collision triggered by the Spanish conquest of the highly developed Incan empire in 1532. Their forced mixing resulted in a third hybrid culture that reached its zenith in two indigenous crafts: metalwork and, especially, tapestry weaving, which the Andean people perfected over 100 years. Beginning with the gorgeously geometric pre-Colonial tunics and mantels worn by the Inca elite, this exhibition traces the progressive absorption and adjustment of Renaissance and Baroque styles from Europe. The silverwork has an astounding roiling energy that seems to reflect the metal's abundance. Hours and admission: see above.   SMITH    * 'DESIGN IS NOT ART: FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS FROM DONALD JUDD TO RACHEL WHITEREAD,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This bracingly contentious but spatially challenged and cursory show is worth seeing, if only because it is the first in an American museum to survey the functional and semifunctional objects designed during the last three decades by artists, in this case 18 well-known Minimalists, post-Minimalists and post-post-Minimalists. The show is overdue, which also makes it seem late, as it ignores many younger artists. It also resembles a high-end home furnishings store. Points of interest are few: Richard Tuttle's lamps, John Chamberlain's carved foam couch, Joel Shapiro's side tables, crystal tumblers by Sol LeWitt and, above all, Franz West's decorate-it-yourself table and chairs. The only designs that seem likely to last are those of Donald Judd, who presides over the exhibition as Picasso would over a survey of Cubism. By default the show reminds us that design is a pressing social issue, which makes it slightly revolting to see successful artists indulge themselves at society's expense. Hours and admission: see above.   SMITH    'DON'T CALL IT PERFORMANCE,' Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, through Nov. 7. Performative seems to be the preferred term now for performance art, to distinguish it from theater. Whatever, it's alive and kicking here where short videos by 30 artists, mostly Latino or Latin American but including some North American and European colleagues, are on view. They are grouped in five categories, dealing with behavior; meditative and spiritual explorations; pop culture; social and political views; and sound, including language and music. The work is uneven, but you do get a sense that a younger generation is keeping performative work a vital presence in the art world. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.. Admission: $6; $4 for students and 65+.   GRACE GLUECK    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting some 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how his likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show with its catalog is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on first Saturday of every month). Admission: $6; students and 62+, $3.   GLUECK    * 'LOOKING AT LIFE,' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, Manhattan), (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 28. From its start in 1936 until its demise as a weekly publication in 1972, Life was the country's archive of public memory, supplying millions of Americans, most of them educated, white and middle class, with a collective visual inventory of the world as imagined for Main Street, U.S.A. This entertaining show reminds of many memorable photographs the magazine published, from Robert Capa's pictures of the landing at Normandy Beach and Larry Burrows's bloodied G.I.'s in Vietnam to W. Eugene Smith's Spanish village and Carlo Bavagnoli's shot of Jane Fonda as Barbarella. The big idea is how Life and, by implication, all forms of popular journalism package news, but in the end the photographs, looked at one by one, speak for themselves. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+.   MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    * 'MEMORIALS OF WAR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 28. The Whitney reveals a little-seen aspect of its collection and some interesting new acquisitions in this small but powerful show of works inspired by the war in Vietnam. Vic Muniz's recent photographs are ghostly recreations of three of the era's most indelible news photographs. Edward Kienholz and Robert Morris are represented by proposals from around 1970 for unexecuted memorials that emphasize the hard truths of armed combat. Chris Burden restages five of America's ''Darker Moments,'' in tableaus whose toy-soldier scale in no way diminishes shocks and aftershocks of these events. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.   SMITH    Galleries: Uptown    * BEN NICHOLSON, Jacobson Howard, 19 East 76th Street, (212) 570-2362, through Oct. 23. The best pieces in this show of paintings and drawings by one of the best painters to emerge in England between the world wars are a half-dozen Cubist-style pictures from the 1940's and 50's. They are notable for their exquisite draftsmanship, suave colors, delicately tactile surfaces and lively, syncopated play with flat shapes and planar layering.   JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    KATHERINE BOWLING, ''Divide,'' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, through Oct. 30. To plain vanilla countryside, Ms. Bowling's softly brushed works bring a touch of soul. Concentrating on the landscapes surrounding her home in upstate New York, she responds to the roads, trees and fields that she experiences daily and the light that falls on them at various times of day and night. Her spirit is derived from the great landscapists of the past but she uses thoroughly modern compositional and painting devices.   GLUECK    PETER GREAVES, ''Reverie,'' Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through Oct. 23. Mr. Greaves's miniature portraits of attractive young women, each a bit larger than a postage stamp, are marvels of fastidious technique. With a slightly hazy focus and not a single visible stroke of pencil or brush, his tiny, pensive heads seem to emerge as if conjured by sorcery from the dark backgrounds.   JOHNSON    PAUL HENRY RAMIREZ, ''In Fluent Form,'' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, through Oct. 23. The stylized parsings of the body in these impeccably mannered canvases are accomplished by dividing flat, pristine white grounds with arrangements of thin vertical and horizaontal lines, often rooted in rounded blocks of brilliant color. The lines support bright, fleshy blobs in candy hues and occasionally end in hearts that flower into symmetrical bursts of wiry, wiglike curls. Elegant splatters of drops in the shape of eyeballs dance cheerily around these conceits. The high-finish paint surface is nothing short of perfection. The body as an 18th-century drawing room or a Vivaldi composition might work as a description of these pretty but sterile paintings.   GLUECK    Galleries: SoHo    'COVER GIRL: THE FEMALE BODY AND ISLAM IN CONTEMPORARY ART,' Ise Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 925-1649, through Oct. 23. Islam is a monolithic word in the West, though there is every reason to know it shouldn't be. The five women in this show were born in Islamic countries or raised in Islamic households. Yet no two of them take the same approach to the theme -- at once a stereotype and a reality -- of the veiled female body in Islamic culture. A wall text by the Indian artist Rummana Hussain, who died in 1999, captures the prevailing refusal to deal in easy answers: ''Have you defined her? Does she have any options? Are her beliefs an escape? Or a security? Or a habit? Or a choice?'' The complete text is quite long, and it is composed entirely of questions.   COTTER    * 'LEON FERRARI: POLITISCRIPTS,' The Drawing Room, 35 Wooster St., (212) 219-2166, through Oct. 23. Born in Argentina in 1920, Leon Ferrari is one of a group of Latin American modernists who, in the 1960's, created an intensely politicized art that ran in parallel to, and sometimes anticipated, trends in Europe and North America. The ink-on-paper pieces in this small show may best be understood as a response to the repressive political of environment of Argentina in 1960's, when censorship was common. A few are inflammatory statements by the artist written in a twisting script at once amusingly ornate and next to impossible to read. And even those that look entirely abstract are executed with care, so that they all convey the impression of carrying coded and encrypted information known only to the artist. In short, they are like taunting gestures of counter-censorship. Through its very opaqueness abstraction becomes a political tool.   COTTER    ROBIN HILL, Lennon Weinberg, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012, through Oct. 23. Second-generation Process artists don't fade away, they just keep marshalling orderly accumulations of this or that material as if Eva Hesse never existed. The works here employ cotton batting, wax, plaster and string, as well as hundreds of tiny circles of mica that are pinned to the wall in buoyant circling lines. Beautiful, but also familiar.   SMITH    * DONALD JUDD, Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through Oct. 23. This show features an unknown work: the only triangular piece in captivity by the generally four-square Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd. It is large, equilateral, made of raw plywood mad open at the top, with its interior and exterior unexpectedly opposed. The only other triangular Judd is an outdoor work in concrete in Australia.   SMITH    'TALESPINNING: SELECTIONS FALL 2004,' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through Oct. 23. The work of 14 artists whose imagery flirts with narrative in one way or another fills this wide-ranging show, which exposes some intriguing talents. Some manipulate texts and even whole books; others play with fairy tales and folklore; still others base figments on literary characters and a few address social, political and other worldly topics. It all adds up to an uneven show, but one in the center's tradition of invigorating experiment.   GLUECK    Galleries: Chelsea    AN-MY LE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through Oct. 23. ''Theater of war'' refers to the geopolitical area that any war actively encompasses. But battles are staged and choreographed, troops deployed in units, like corps de ballet. All of this requires rehearsal, and rehearsal for war is the subject of these photographs, shot at the Marine Corps Air Ground Control Center in California, a desert outpost where marines train for future combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The terrain has a John Ford-ish grandeur. The marines act out cowboy-and-Indian roles: some play Americans; others play Iraqis. The pictures are dramatic and gorgeous, as combat photography often is. They are also apt documents of a war which, some people argue, is based on a fiction and, at least as originally scripted, staged for the media.   COTTER    * NALINI MALANI, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074, through Oct. 23. Ms. Malani, based in Mumbai, has been seen here only sporadically, with paintings in museum group shows and an intensely theatrical video installation at the New Museum two years ago. Both media play a role in this strong gallery solo show, her first in Manhattan, that draws on mythology, religion and history, both Western and Indian. In paintings, she dovetails the figures of Sita from the ''Ramayana'' and Medea -- the one an ideal of submissive self-sacrifice, the other an emblem of destructive fury -- to propose a complex female persona beyond controlling stereotypes. A video installation addressing sectarian violence and a magic lantern-style shadow play complete the exhibition, which finds a political artist of impressive visual range at the height of her power.   COTTER    * PIPILOTTI RIST, Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through Oct. 23. This relatively uncluttered video installation offers full-blown Rist World along with further proof that the artist's dizzying, slipping, sliding conflation of sound, color, scale and spatial illusion has few equals in video. The subversive (feminist) tensions of Ms. Rist's best works are absent here, but the work makes the brain so fuzzily relaxed you may not notice.   SMITH    Other Galleries    'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life.   COTTER    * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 13. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses.   SMITH    TERESA HUBBARD AND ALEXANDER BIRCHLER, ''Single Wide,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through Oct. 22. ''Single Wide'' is a technically sophisticated, six-minute video loop that revolves around the nighttime event of a distraught woman crashing her pickup truck into her rural ''single wide''-size trailer home. Shot in one long circulating pan, it is like a film version of a Gregory Crewdson photograph with the vividly amplified sound effects of a Janet Cardiff production.   JOHNSON    Last Chance    STEPHEN ANDREWS/JERRY MORIARTY, Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-3583, through tomorrow. Mr. Moriarty paints poignant autobiographical fantasies in a brusquely simplified realistic style. Voyeurism, women's underwear, leaking body fluids and a beloved dog named Fella are among his subjects; the paintings have the mundane, sometimes comically embarrassing weirdness of dreams. Mr. Andrews translates images of events in Iraq into soft-focus crayon drawings.   JOHNSON    HERNAN BAS, ''Sometimes With One I Love,'' Daniel Reich, 537 A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, through tomorrow. Mr. Bas, who lives in Miami and was in the 2004 Whitney Biennial, paints formally modest but unabashedly sentimental narratives of adventure, sexual intrigue and mystical experience starring slender, fine-featured adolescent boys. Made in an expressionistic style that calls to mind paperback book covers of the 1940's, his easel-size paintings are exciting mainly for the possibly more ambitious future of painterly story-telling they promise.   JOHNSON    KRISTIN CALABRESE: EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER, Leo Koenig Inc., 249 Centre Street, SoHo (212) 334-9255, through tomorrow. The large paintings in this New York debut espouse an unlikely combination of Photo Realism, Process Art and political critique. Every image has been made or arranged by the artist and then painted, whether it is a mound of her students playing dead (''The Price of Oil'') or a tangle of colored tape (''Oh What a Tangled Web We Weave''). Clever, well-made and brightly colored, they offer cheerful protest in an uncheerful time.   SMITH    * ON KAWARA, ''Paintings of 40 Years,'' David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea,(212) 727-2070, through tomorrow. Along with the Rackstraw Downes show at Betty Cunningham and Giorgio Morandi at Lucas Schoormans, this radiant mini-survey ranks among the three most beautiful shows of painting in Chelsea right now. It is certainly the best chance to be won over by the seemingly relentless monochromatic date paintings that the artist has been making since 1966. They turn out to be remakrably varied, and almost perfect in their balance of mind and matter -- also known as the Conceptual and the Minimal.   SMITH    ROY LICHTENSTEIN, City Hall, City Hall Park and the Tweed Courthouse, Lower Manhattan, through today. Rising five stories under the octagonal skylight of the Tweed Courthouse's fabulous Italianate rotunda, Lichtenstein's clunky tower of giant cartoon brush strokes is an impressive sight, the centerpiece of a Public Art Fund installation of four sculptures in and around City Hall. Its sly commentary on Modernist myths of freedom and spontaneity is enhanced by its insertion at the core of New York City's bureaucratic control center. You can't just spontaneously walk in to see it, though. You can call 311 to sign up for a Friday-only tour.   JOHNSON    'NO RETURN,' Momenta Art, 72 Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058, through Monday. Circulation -- of wealth, information, organic matter -- is the theme this shrewd group show. Where some artists make money from art, Jed Ela makes art from money. He weaves baskets from $1 bills, then sells them for the dollar amounts used. Peggy Diggs stamps dollar bills with conscience-probing one-line questions. The Conceptual artist Rainer Ganahl mails postcards using handmade stamps with politically loaded inscriptions. Rutherford Chang scrambles words and images from The New York Times into abstraction. Pawel Wojtasik's short film ''Dark Sun Squeeze'' documents the workings of a sewage treatment; filtered through technology and art, excrement gleams and shines.   COTTER    'PAINTING WITH WORDS,' Koichi Yanagi Oriental Fine Arts, 58A East 66th St., (212) 744-5577, through Sunday. Koichi Yanagi's gallery is small; so are his exhibitions, even when their themes are spacious, as is the case in this bouquet of literary images. Handwritten poems trickle down sheets of paper that glint with powdered mica. A 17th century lacquer writing box alludes to the classic ''Tales of Ise,'' The centerpiece, a six panel screen attributed to Kano Takanobu (1571-1618), has a scene from ''The Tale of Genji'' will end in an amorous pursuit, though its hard to imagine any passion discomposing this courtly universe of 14-carat clouds, roofless rooms and origami-crisp gowns.   COTTER    THOMAS SCHEIBITZ, ''Brot & Spiele,'' Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea,(212) 414-4144, through tomorrow. Mr. Scheibitz, who will represent Germany at the 2005 Venice Bienale, absorbs all kinds of sources -- from centuries-old maps to contemporary bar graphs -- into semi-abstract, semiotically suggestive paintings and constructions. What his allusive works mean is hard to say, but with their sharp edges and strident colors, they offer an interesting mix of raw clunkiness and stylish retro-modernism.   JOHNSON    'SEMI-LUCID,' White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 924-4212, through Sunday. Lauren Ross, who recently resigned as director and chief curator of White Columns, has organized an engaging show about a prevalent tendency in contemporary art: the reshuffling of familiar graphic conventions into pictures that are teasingly illusory yet indecipherably abstract. Aaron Noble's muscular wall paintings and Robert Medvedz's compressive ink drawings recycle comic book graphics; Jiha Moon mixes Eastern and Western sources with a delicate touch; and Julian Pozzi draws spacey configurations of finely hatched boxes inspired by patio furniture.   JOHNSON    WOLFGANG STAEHLE, ''2004,'' Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323, through tomorrow. An entrancing paradox animates Mr. Staehle's real-time video projections. Mural-scale images in the darkened main gallery show a view of Manhattan and a bucolic upstate view of the Hudson River, delivered by on-site cameras. A third, on a laptop screen, shows the Grand Tetons in Wyoming. Nothing could be more artificial, yet as you study the slight changes that happen with each 10-second digital update, you feel as if you are truly in the spiritually uplifting presence of nature.   JOHNSON    'SQUINT,' Jack the Pelican, 487 Driggs Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 782-0183, through Sunday. This aptly titled group show challenges the eye with effects both minuscule and manic. In the latter category is Deborah Sperber's actual-size replica of Jackson Pollock's ''Autumn Rhythm,'' accomplished with 165,000 pipe cleaners. As for tiny, there is Mark Shetabi's peephole version of Mary Boone's SoHo gallery. The thrills are mostly cheap, but they're still thrills.   SMITH    DAVID WOJNAROWICZ We don't have artists like David Wojnarowicz these days. Or if we do, they're lurking out there around the edges of the mainstream art world, which is pretty much where Wojnarowicz stayed before he died of AIDS in his 30's in 1992. He came to New York as a runaway kid, worked as a street hustler and settled on the Lower East Side, where he wrote voluminously and made art. He shot a series of photographs, ''Rimbaud in New York,'' between 1978 and 1979, when the city was on the skids. Each picture shows a man wearing a cut-out mask of the face of the precocious French poet Arthur Rimbaud, taken when he was in his teens. The man in Wojnarowicz's photos -- or men; it's uncertain whether he posed for all of them or asked others to as well -- appears in Times Square and Coney Island, in subways and on the abandoned West Side piers known as trysting places for gay sex. He smokes, shoots-up, masturbates or just stares; in two pictures he brandishes a gun. These are romantic images, and political images. They're young, lonely, erotic, cast-a-cold-eye tough. They're about disaffection, and about intense, hard-wired attachment, deep love and deep anger mixed. The gallery is also displaying pages from Wojnarowicz's notebooks; he was at least as good a writer as he was an artist, and maybe better. We sure could use his likes again. (Roth Horowitz, 160A East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 717-9067, through Oct. 30. Another show, ''Out of Silence: Artwork With Original Text,'' by Wojnarowicz appears at P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1044, through Nov. 13. Both are free.)

4," A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.    AHMED ABDULLAH, Sistas' Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, entrance at Jefferson Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766. The trumpeter Ahmed Abdullah had a memorable niche in New York's underground jazz scene during the 1980's, as a free-jazz musician intrigued by rhythmic vamps that gave his work a cohesion. (He played briefly with the great drummer Ed Blackwell and with the tenor saxophonist David S. Ware.) Sets are tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $20 (Ben Ratliff).    MONTY ALEXANDER TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)  864-6662. Mr. Alexander, a jazz pianist originally from Jamaica, has often refitted reggae songs and steel-drum sounds for a jazz-trio context; it's breezy, amiable stuff. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $25 (Ratliff).    * RYAN ADAMS/OLLABELLE, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212)  496-7070. Ryan Adams is steeped in the right 1960's songwriters -- Van Morrison, Neil Young, Gram Parsons, Bob Dylan -- and lately he has punched up his music with a touch of 1980's indie-rock. He's an unpredictable and ornery performer, but his songs can distill heartbreak, longing and rancor. Ollabelle, which gives bluesy updates to old gospel songs like ''John the Revelator'' and ''Jesus on the Mainline.'' Tonight at 8; tickets are $36.50 (Jon Pareles).    ASYLUM STREET SPANKERS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Sex, drugs, booze, unplugged instruments and anachronistic swing are the makings of the Asylum Street Spankers, who bring an absurd sense of humor to songs that update the spirit of vaudeville. Sunday at 8:30 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Pareles).    JELLYBEAN BENITEZ/LITTLE LOUIE VEGA, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, Manhattan (212) 239-2672. Latin rhythms have always been a foundation of house music. Now a pair of disc jockey-producers -- Jellybean Benitez, whose most famous client may be Madonna, and Little Louie Vega of Masters at Work -- take over the dance floor at this Latin Club, with Judy Torres adding some live vocals. Tonight from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.; admission is $25 (Pareles).    THE BLACK KEYS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)  533-2111. The Black Keys claim they never heard the White Stripes before starting their own blues-rocking, guitar-and-drums duo. They're far more of a throwback to straightforward 1970's boogie and blues outfits, like Savoy Brown or Ten Years After, than the White Stripes are. Tomorrow night at 1:30, with the Cuts at 11:30; tickets are $13. Sunday night at 11, with the National at 10 and the Cuts at 9; tickets are $13 in advance, $15 on Sunday (Pareles).    * CRISTINA BRANCO, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The Portuguese songs called fado (fate) balance sorrowful melodies and lyrics about tragic destiny in a gleaming cat's-cradle of fingerpicked Portuguese guitars. It's music that frames a singer's voice while it mercilessly exposes every nuance of sorrow and determination. Cristina Branco is one of Portugal's most celebrated young fadistas. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 (Pareles).    VINICIUS CANTUARIA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Vinicius Cantuaria, whose songs have been recorded by major Brazilian hitmakers including Caetano Veloso, has lived in New York City since 1995 without leaving Rio de Janeiro behind. He is steeped in the bossa nova, and he knows it well enough to stretch the form without losing its essence. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $23 (Pareles).    COLONEL CLAYPOOL'S BUCKET OF BERNIE BRAINS, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)  777-6800. That's Les Claypool from Primus on bass and vocals, Buckethead from (briefly) Guns N' Roses on guitar, Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic on keyboards and Brain on drums, in swampy, deep-riffing funk jams with some grim cackling about the state of the world. Tonight at 7, with Gabby La La opening; tickets are $32 (Pareles).    RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)  582-2121. With a slightly withdrawn, low-affect style, making his way expertly through his band's rhythmic twists, the saxophonist Mr. Coltrane has grown a great deal as a bandleader in the last few years. The band includes Luis Perdomo on piano, Drew Gress on bass, and E. J. Strickland on drums. Sets tonight at 9, 11 and 12:30; tomorrow night at 8, 10 and 11:30; and Sunday at 9 and 11 p.m. Cover charge, $30; minimum, $10 (Ratliff).    DEAD MOON, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side (212) 260-4700 and Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. In ''Sorrow's Forecast,'' on an album Dead Moon released last year, Fred Cole sings ''I could have made the right moves/been a smooth pop singer.'' That seems unlikely. His voice quavers and swoops like that of Pere Ubu's David Thomas, and the three-piece band he started in 1987 -- with his wife, Toody, on bass -- plays songs that sound as if they came from 1966, when garage-rock was turning psychedelic. At Mercury Lounge tonight at 11:30, with Antietam at 10:30, Blood on the Wall at 9:30 and Dynasty at 8:30; admission is $12. At Maxwell's tomorrow night at 9:30, with the Little Killers and the Ribeye Bros. opening; admission is $12 (Pareles).    RAMATAOU DIAKITE, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Ramatou Diakite is a singer from the Wassoulou region of Mali, where women have a tradition of singing to entertain and instruct. The songs mix elements of Arabic and sub-Saharan Africa, with driving triple-time rhythms behind her fervent voice. Tomorrow night at 10, with disc jockeys playing African music till 4 a.m.; admission is $20 (Pareles).    * FRANZ FERDINAND, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. A sly, stylish Scottish band in love with well-tailored bass lines and stiletto-sharp guitars. The group's self-titled debut album (which recently won Britain's prestigious Mercury Music Prize) is full of taut, trebly songs that reduce new-wave to its skin-and-bones essentials. A highlight of the album -- and of the band's live show -- is ''Michael,'' a raucous (and not-exactly-earnest) gay love song, where singer Alex Kapranos gasps, ''Michael, you're the boy with the leather hips/Sticky hair, sticky stubble on my sticky lips.'' Sunday night at 6:45, with the Delays; tickets are $22.50 (Kelefa Sanneh).    * ROBERT GLASPER TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Glasper, from Houston, is a young pianist with an excellent trio that's been gathering strength in New York clubs over the past five years. He brings out student enthusiasms: big Errol Garner chords, Herbie Hancock harmony, Keith Jarrett group-improvisation tactics, Oscar Peterson speed. But his group has its own crisp, skittering cooperation, with hiphop in its bounce, reaffirming swing and destabilizing it in equal measures. Sunday night at 8 and 10; cover charge is $15 and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).    * COLEMAN HAWKINS CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION WITH LEW TABACKIN, ERIC ALEXANDER, JOE LOVANO, DEWEY REDMAN, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Coleman Hawkins is the other titan having a 100th birthday this year, and as the starting place, more or less, for the tenor saxophone in jazz, he's directly responsible for a lot of the best players we hear today. An excellent crew will do him honor: Mr. Lovano, gusty and discursive; Mr. Alexander, blues-edged and Coltrane-inspired; Mr. Redman, a musician with a poetic, smoky style; and Lew Tabackin, a super-elegant narrative improviser and the most Hawkinslike of the lot. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $$30 at the tables with a $15 minimum, $20 at the bar with a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).    KISS-FM CLASSIC SOUL, Manhattan Center, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan; Ticketmaster, (212) 307-7171. Soul oldies from Cuba Gooding (of the Main Ingredient), the Intruders, the Persuaders and Force MD's. Tomorrow night at 7; tickets are $45 to $75 (Pareles).    JASON LINDNER'S JLECTRIC, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)  242-1063. A new band for a young pianist whose projects have ranged around from big bands to Latin music to electric fusion; the band includes the bassist Avishai Cohen, the saxophonist Jacques Schwartz-Bart, and the singer Claudia Acu√±a. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 a set, members, $10 (Ratliff).    LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO DAVID BOWIE, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. The many guises and huge song catalog of David Bowie are grist for the fond and sardonic pop archivists in the Loser's Lounge, returning to one of their favorite repertories. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20 tonight, $25 tomorrow (Pareles).    STEVE MCKAY'S RADON/BARBEZ/NIK TURNER AND SPACESEED, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)  358-7503. Steve McKay was the free-jazz saxophonist who honked wildly through the 1970 album by Iggy and the Stooges, ''Funhouse,'' and he's leading his current band. Nik Turner, also a saxophonist, was a founding member of Hawkwind. Barbez, a group that includes a theremin and a marimba, brings a whiff of tango and cabaret to a repertory that encompasses Kurt Weill and the Residents. Tonight at 8; admission is $10 (Pareles).    * BRAD MEHLDAU QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Mehldau's trio is one of the quintessential jazz groups of the day; it goes a long way in defining the current devices for group improvisation, and the music has a neat aesthetic frame around it, consistently offering a streamlined sound, full of precise dynamics. This week the group is joined by the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, whose command of harmony and astringent, focused improvising has created many admirers over the last decade. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $30 (Ratliff).    TIFT MERRIT, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111 and Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn (718) 230-0236. Somewhere between Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams, Tift Merritt sings country-rock that can be plaintive and compassionate or dip into Rolling Stones riffs; she knows her way around heartache. At Bowery Ballroom tonight at 11, with the Damnwells at 10 and Chris Stamey at 9; tickets are $15. At Southpaw Sunday night at 8:30, with Chris Stamey opening; tickets are $10 (Pareles).    * DANILO P√âREZ TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. P√©rez is one of the most rhythmically and harmonically sophisticated pianists in jazz, and his collaborations in the last few years with Wayne Shorter and Steve Lacy, as well as his own ambitious solo records, have been worth hearing. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday (Ratliff).    RJD2, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, (718) 599-5103. As a disc jockey and producer, RJD2 has made a mark in underground hip-hop with productions and remixes for Aceyalone, Aesop Rock, El-P and Cannibal Ox, as well as his collaboration with the rapper Blueprint in Soul Position. He likes crisp funk drum breaks overlaid with brooding chords for a mixture of heft and introspection. He's billed on his own tomorrow night at 9, with Diplo and Rob Sonic opening; tickets are $13 in advance, $15 tomorrow (Pareles).    * PATTI SMITH/TELEVISION, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Harking back to CBGB circa 1976, this concert pairs the punk-rock pioneers who didn't repudiate hippie memories. Love, death, transfiguration and pushy guitars have been Patti Smith's staples in the quarter-century since she turned her poetry into punk-rock. Always unpredictable, she still seeks shamanic revelation with every gig. Television revolves around Tom Verlaine's imagistic lyrics, the entwined guitar riffs he shares with Richard Lloyd and modal jams that can lead to places punk-rock never returned to. Tomorrow night at 6:45 ; tickets are $35 in advance, $40 tomorrow (Pareles)    SUPERGRASS, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village (212) 353-1600. Glam-rock yearning meets some punk propulsion in the songs of Supergrass, an English band now celebrating its 10th anniversary that can often sound like it was formed in 1972. Tomorrow night at 7, with the Twenty Twos opening; tickets are $25 (Pareles).    GRADY TATE, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)  255-3626. Grady Tate has been a swinging, audience-pleasing jazz singer since the 1960's, and a drummer as well. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).    * THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. They Might Be Giants, the songwriting team of John Flansburgh and John Linnell (est. 1982), are masters of the bouncy tune and the unlikely, nerd-friendly topic: presidents, palindromes, thermostats, loud clubs, Dr. Evil. Their latest works, once available by extremely low-fi answering machine, are now on www.dialasong.com. With their television themes, movie songs, albums, commercials, concerts and children's book, they are among the busiest acts in pop, and they are playing two different sets for their two-night stand. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, with Demetri Martin opening tonight and Travis Morrison opening tomorrow; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 on the day (Pareles).    * VIA TANIA, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. Last year, this South Africa-born, Australia-based singer released ''Under a Different Sky'' (Chocolate Industries), laying breathy, insinuative songs atop filigreed beats and shimmering textures. For ''In the Deep,'' she chose a diffracted jazz groove to match her murmurs; ''I Dream Again,'' with the alt-hip-hop producer Prefuse 73, starts with an angular beat that slows and stops just before she starts singing. Tonight at 8, with Astronauts of Antiquity, Kristeen Young and Heidi Saperstein; tickets are $8 (Sanneh).    LIZZ WRIGHT, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8770. The singer Lizz Wright is only in her mid-20's, and her repertory, as of now, includes some originals, some songs by the drummer and composer Brian Blade, and some spirituals, theater songs and jazz standards. You can find her first album, ''Salt,'' in the jazz department of record stores because it's on a jazz label (Verve) and because jazz musicians (including the pianist Jon Cowherd, her musical director) play in her band. But she doesn't show much evidence of being any sort of traditional jazz singer -- rhythmically, gesturally, technically. She's a pop-gospel-folk-R & B kind of person, with a voice that abhors overstatement. Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30; cover charge is $30 (Ratliff).    * YERBA BUENA, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn (718) 230-0236. Yerba Buena meshes rumba rhythms, and other Afro-Cuban and Caribbean styles, with gutsy, distorted guitars to create pan-American party music with deep roots. Tonight at 8:30, with Pacha Sound System featuring DJ Nova and DJ Greg Caz; tickets are $15 (Pareles).
