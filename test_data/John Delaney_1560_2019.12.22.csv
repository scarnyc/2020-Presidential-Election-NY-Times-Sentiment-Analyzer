(Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prize winner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BACH AT LEIPZIG' Itamar Moses's comedy is an ardent but hollow literary homage to Tom Stoppard stuffed with arcana about religious and musical squabbles in 18th-century Germany and knowingly feeble jokes. Despite the nimble gifts of a first-rate cast, the play never works up the farcical energy to lift us over the puddles of book-learning (2:15). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'BROKEN JOURNEY' A gripping production of a modern-day rendering of ''Rashomon'' by a British poet and playwright who employs clever wordplay to define the characters and delve into their psyche. A solid cast manages to hold the tension taut for most of the 110 minutes. Theater Three, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is pleasantly fluffy, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way, but lots of laughs (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Genzlinger)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE GENTLEMAN DANCING-MASTER'  The Pearl Theater Company is having way more fun than a company specializing in classics ought to have with this 17th-century comedy by William Wycherley. Marsha Stephanie Blake is terrific as a young woman betrothed to her cousin but hot for someone else; the loons who surround her are great, too (2:50). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)    'HAMLET' Michael Cumpsty gives a forceful, intelligent reading of the title role in the Classic Stage Company's likably intimate production of Shakespeare's tale of doom-struck Danes. Brian Kulick's production is heavy on the directorial gimmickry (smell the spray paint! watch the set be shredded!), leaving psychology and philosophy to fend for themselves (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HILDA' Marie Ndiaye's play is a psychodrama from which most of the psychology seems to have mysteriously evaporated, taking a lot of the drama with it. Ellen Karas stars as a bourgeois housewife whose obsession with her maid eventually unhinges her (1:20). Part of the Act French Festival. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but all others will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'DOÑA ROSITA LA SOLTERA (DOÑA ROSITA THE SPINSTER)' Watching Repertorio Español's ''Doña Rosita the Spinster'' is a bit like finding a dried flower pressed in a book: charming, archaic and just a bit musty, even though the lead is played by Denise Quiñones -- Miss Universe, 2001. Federico García Lorca's poetic play has a predictable premise: a beautiful young woman waits in vain for the handsome cousin to whom she is engaged. Luckily, the tragicomedy has some laughs (2:00). In Spanish with live simultaneous translation via headsets. Repertorio Español, at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Phoebe Hoban)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley)    'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whitehead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clichés of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley).    'JUNIE B. JONES'  A spirited entertainment (1:30). Theaterworks/NYC, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'THE RUBY SUNRISE' Rinne Groff's period drama explores the country's growing pains during the early years of television. Directed by the new Public Theater chief, Oskar Eustis, the play casts glancing looks at a large subject, namely the country's failure to harness advances in technology to socially progressive ends. But it is essentially a deftly structured but heavy-treading drama about the dashed dreams and tarnished ideals of two generations of spirited Midwestern women (2:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'SEE WHAT I WANNA SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsuke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)     * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)      'DERAILED' (R, 110 minutes) A glossy and often risible bit of trash about an adulterous affair gone bad, bad, bad, starring the invaluable Clive Owen and an uncomfortable-looking Jennifer Aniston. (Dargis)    * 'DOWN TO THE BONE' (No rating, 105 minutes) ''Down to the Bone,'' which won the Special Jury Prize at last year's Sundance Festival, is the kind of movie most independent films strive in vain to be: a small, beautifully faceted gem. Vera Farmiga gives a pitch-perfect performance as Irene, a mother of two whose life is precariously built around a cocaine addiction. (Dana Stevens)    * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter Off Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife and a young screenwriter. (Holden)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warm-hearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'IN THE MIX' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This predictable, one-dimensional romantic comedy is all about its star, Usher, who plays a New York D.J. beloved by one and all. Beautiful women lust after him, but when a Mafia princess (Emmanuelle Chriqui) joins their number, her mobster father (Chazz Palminteri) disapproves. Even though Darrell (Usher) once took a bullet for him. (Anita Gates)     'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the 1991 Persian Gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'JUST FRIENDS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) In this crude, clobbering comedy, a former geek who has reinvented himself as a Hollywood smoothie (Ryan Reynolds) returns to his New Jersey hometown to win his high school dream girl (Amy Smart). (Holden)     'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)      * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'PRIME' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Actually, pretty mediocre. A thin romantic comedy that nonetheless has its charms, most of them provided by Uma Thurman as a divorced 37-year-old who falls for a 23-year-old who happens to be her therapist's son. (Scott)     'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    'SEAMLESS' (No rating, 75 minutes) Four upstart fashion designers toil with fabrics and finances as they compete for a career-making award in this genial documentary from Douglas Keeve, the maker of ''Unzipped.'' (Nathan Lee)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)     * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    '39 POUNDS OF LOVE'  (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Hebrew) Afflicted by a rare disease that keeps his weight at 39 pounds and allows him to move only one finger, the 34-year-old animator Ami Ankilewitz still dreams of riding a Harley-Davidson. In this lighthearted yet forthright documentary, the director Dani Menkin presents a bracingly honest portrait of a man refusing to be defined by the limitations of his body. (Jeannette Catsoulis)       'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)     'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)     'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    BRIGHT STARS, BIG CITY: CHINESE CINEMA'S FIRST GOLDEN ERA, 1922-1937 (Through Dec. 22). The Museum of Modern Art begins its celebration of Chinese film and Shanghai's movie stars tonight.

Museums    ASIA SOCIETY: 'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -- THE ART OF DINH Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'EDWARD BURTYNSKY: MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck)     * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. (See above.)(Michael Kimmelman)     * MET: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Kimmelman)      * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: BEYOND THE VISIBLE: 'THE ART OF ODILON REDON,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)      * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART : 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,'  through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * THE MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'LASTING FOUNDATIONS: THE ART OF ARCHITECTURE IN AFRICA,' through Jan. 9. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. An evocative film of the annual replastering of the great Mosque of Djenne, the largest adobe building in the world, is an inspired bonus: a vision of an architectural monument as love object. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)    * NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY: 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS,' through Feb. 12. Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069. (Smith)        * P.S. 1: 'THE PAINTED WORLD,' through Jan. 30. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)     * RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS HIMALAYAN ART?,' This museum, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, is a oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and mid-size New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)      * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    GLENN KAINO An installation by this West Coast conceptualist features a big chessboard made of wooden squares taken from gun ammunition boxes and bronze playing pieces made from casts of the artist's hand signaling friendly and unfriendly intentions. On the walls hang grisaille portraits of famous chess players, each painted in one hour. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)    TOM WESSELMANN: 'WORKS ON PAPER, RETROSPECTIVE'  Typed as a Pop artist early on for his portrayals of commercial foodstuffs as well as of stylized women's bodies (or parts thereof) that mingled classic odalisque and sexy pinup, Tom Wesselmann (1931-2004) had other strings to his bow, among them an interest in landscape and, later in his career, large abstract cutouts in metal. His provocative nude icons are here in abundance, but also evident is his interest in Matisse, Picasso and Mondrian. Maxwell Davidson Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 759-7555, through Dec. 23. (Glueck)    * 'THE WOMEN OF GIACOMETTI' This museum-quality show of paintings and sculptures focuses on Alberto Giacometti's curiously asexual representations of his mother, sister, wife and other women in his life. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through Dec. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea     POLLY APFELBAUM: 'CARTOON GARDEN' Give Ms. Apfelbaum credit for trying one of her signature fabric floors without color. Still, though the wide rectangular plot of cartoon blossoms drawn with black dye on pieces of white velvet is graphically lively, the aesthetic payoff as a whole is not worth the sacrifice of color. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Dec. 23.(Johnson)    * JEREMY COMINS While neither especially original nor current, Mr. Comins's small carved wood sculptures evoke the history of the medium with assured sophistication, impeccable craft and that unmarketable commodity called integrity. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Dec. 10. (Smith)    * 'DANUDO: RECENT SCULPTURES OF EL ANATSUI' In this truly stunning two-gallery show of recent work by an artist who lives and works in Nigera, each sculpture is made from thousands of crushed aluminum liquor-bottle caps and seals, stitched together with copper wire. The results are supple, fabriclike hangings that look like a cross between Kente cloth, abstract paintings and magic carpets. At Skoto Gallery in Chelsea, the work glows like gold on plain white walls; at Contemporary African Art on the Upper West Side, which is open only on Saturdays from noon to 6 p.m., it generates its heat with a more intimate kind of magic in an apartmentlike space. Skoto Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fifth floor, (212) 352-8058, through Jan. 21, and Contemporary African Art Gallery, 330 West 108th Street, (212) 749-8848, through April 30. (Cotter)    MONA HATOUM: 'MOBILE HOME' The playful side of this often politically motivated sculptor prevails. The centerpiece, ''Mobile Home,'' is an arrangement of domestic objects strung on fine cables between metal traffic barriers; it takes a moment to realize that the toys, chairs, suitcases and other items are slowly rolling back and forth on tiny wheels. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 367-7474, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)  Julie Langsam: 'From Here to Modernity' and Gary Petersen: 'Colossal Youth' In Ms. Langsam's landscape paintings -- which mourn the demise of Modernism -- Breuer's Whitney Museum and Wright's Guggenheim and other monuments of 20th-century architecture are isolated far away on empty plains under gloomy, toxically colored skies. On the other hand, while Mr. Petersen's jauntily suave, geometric paintings are hardly revolutionary, they still exude an infectious optimism about the aesthetic and spiritual delights that Modernism still makes possible. Michael Steinberg, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 924-5770, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    * 'MFENGU' The power of female creativity courses through this exquisite show of South African garments at Axis Gallery. All but one of the skirts and capes was made for, and by, women of the Mfengu cultural group. In every case, the surfaces are ornamented with lines of beadwork, as fine and taut as compass needles. Agnes Martin would have adored the elegant probity of this work, and its message of strength in restraint. Axis Gallery, 453 West 17th Street, fourth floor, (212) 741-2582, through Dec. 22. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    ELSA MORA: 'BIRTH' A Cuban-born New Yorker, Ms. Mora creates paintings, drawings, collages and sculptures of lyrical and seemingly antique surrealism. One series consists of 50 small bottles, each containing a photographic transparency and sporting a colorful sculptured bird head and a pair of baby-doll legs. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1200, through December. (Johnson)    RICHARD TUTTLE: 'CONSTRUCTED RELIEF PAINTINGS' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28.(Johnson)    Last Chance    * JEREMY BLAKE: 'SODIUM FOX' The best animated video of this innovative artist's career is a dense, briskly based fusion of formalism and underbelly, both indubitably American, propelled by the words and voice of the poet David Berman. Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-0500, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    * OPEN WALLS In the main gallery, six emerging artists each make impressive and quite different use of one wall for displays of painting, photography, video or installation; the exemplary ancillary shows and debuts include ''The Early Show,'' a survey of childhood and teenage efforts by 40 contemporary artists. The total confirms White Columns as the liveliest of Manhattan's revitalized veteran alternative spaces. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street) ,West Village (212) 924-4212, closing tomorrow. (Smith).     * NANCY SPERO: 'CRI DU COEUR' Mixing paint and silkscreened images on paper, a low-lying friezelike work follows a procession of female mourners borrowed from an Egyptian tomb into inky obscurity, suggesting a world declining into violence, chaos and bottomless grief. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 315-0470, closing tomorrow. (Smith).    * JOHN WESLEY: 'DON'T EAT MY EAGLE' A beautiful show of comical and erotic paintings from the 1960's by an American Surrealist who has been mistaken for a Pop artist. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, closing tomorrow.

Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley).    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a storyline poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). The August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prize winner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp and at over two hours, it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200.(Neil Genzlinger)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Genzlinger)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'HAMLET' Michael Cumpsty gives a forceful, intelligent reading of the title role in the Classic Stage Company's likably intimate production of Shakespeare's tale of doom-struck Danes. Brian Kulick's production is heavy on the directorial gimmickry (smell the spray paint! watch the set be shredded!), leaving psychology and philosophy to fend for themselves (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HILDA' Marie Ndiaye's play is a psychodrama from which most of the psychology seems to have mysteriously evaporated, taking a lot of the drama with it. Ellen Karas stars as a bourgeois housewife whose obsession with her maid eventually unhinges her (1:20). Part of the Act French Festival. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'JUNIE B. JONES' A spirited entertainment (1:30). Theaterworks/NYC, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200. (Van Gelder)    'MEDEA'  The Jean Cocteau Repertory's cliché-ridden modern translation strains to be relevant (1:30). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 the Bowery, near East Second Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    'THE RUBY SUNRISE' Rinne Groff's period drama explores the country's growing pains during the early years of television. Directed by the new Public Theater chief Oskar Eustis, the play casts glancing looks at a large subject, namely the country's failure to harness advances in technology to socially progressive ends. But it is essentially a deftly structured but heavy-treading drama about the dashed dreams and tarnished ideals of two generations of spirited Midwestern women (2:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SEE WHAT I WANNA TO SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsoke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WAITING FOR GODOT' (2:30). In this solid production, it is Sam Coppola (Vladimir) and Joseph Ragno (Estragon) who are waiting for the world's most famous no-show. It's been 50 years since Samuel Beckett's play was first staged on Broadway, and the changes in the world since then give the never-changing world of Didi and Gogo some interesting new resonance. Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton,(212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'BROKEN JOURNEY' A gripping production of a modern-day rendering of ''Rashomon'' by a British poet and playwright who employs clever wordplay to define the characters and delve into their psyche. A solid cast manages to hold the tension taut for most of the 110 minutes. Theater Three, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton)    'PAUL ROBESON'  Paul Robeson's voice remains his most enduring legacy, so it makes sense to cast Phillip Hayes Dean's play about him with an opera singer. Kevin Maynor, a resonant bass, gets some of the impact of Robeson's singing voice, but his monologue tends to blur together the many vignettes that Mr. Dean tried to cram into this rather simplistic reduction of a major figure. (The play originally ran on Broadway with James Earl Jones.) Robeson deserves better, but this is better than nothing (2:00). Henry Street Settlement's Abrons Arts Center/Recital Hall, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200.(Anne Midgette)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

(Brantley)    * 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, closing Sunday. ( Midgette)    'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, closing Sunday. ( Jefferson)    * 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prizewinning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, closing Sunday.(Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis)    'BLACKMAIL BOY' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Greek) A doctor is sleeping with a younger man, who is having an affair with an older woman, and another character is having sex with her son-in-law. At times, Michalis Reppas and Thanassis Papathanasiou's film has the welcome feeling of farce, but mostly it just seems determined to shock. And to turn violent. (Anita Gates)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)       * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)    'CLASSE TOUS RISQUES' (No rating, 103 minutes, in French and Italian) Claude Sautet's 1960 gangster melodrama was lost in the shuffle of the new wave; now it is back, in a restored print, with soulful, vivid performances by Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo as a pair of honorable thieves on the run. (Scott)      * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter Off Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife and a young screenwriter. (Holden)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warm-hearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the first gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of Los Angeles. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)     'NAKED IN ASHES' (No rating, 108 minutes) This documentary provides an intimate, yet ultimately unsatisfying glimpse into the everyday lives of several Indian yogis, the Hindu mystics who smear their bodies with ash, live in improvised dwellings on the margins of society, and subject their bodies to extreme ascetic. Paula Fouce has gained unprecedented access to her subjects, but her own admiration for them makes this documentary more heartfelt than it is rigorous. (Dana Stevens)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'PRIVATE' (No rating, 90 minutes, in English, Hebrew and Arabic) This movie distills the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into a nightmarish microcosm when a midnight raid by Israeli soldiers on the house of a peaceful, well-educated Palestinian family turns their home into an occupied territory. (Holden)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)    '39 POUNDS OF LOVE'  (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Hebrew) Afflicted by a rare disease that keeps his weight at 39 pounds and allows him to move only one finger, the 34-year-old animator Ami Ankilewitz nevertheless dreams of riding a Harley-Davidson. In his lighthearted yet forthright documentary, ''39 Pounds of Love,'' the director Dani Menkin presents a bracingly honest portrait of a man refusing to be defined by the limitations of his body. (Jeannette Catsoulis)      'UNVEILED' (No rating, 97 minutes, in German and Farsi) Angelina Maccarone's film occasionally suffers from a self-conscious artiness, but at its center is an extraordinary performance by Jasmine Tabatabai as a young woman whose expectations from life have been lowered by a lifetime of systematic mistreatment, but who still holds out hope for the possibility of both justice and love. (Stevens)    'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)      'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    FOREVER GARBO: A RETROSPECTIVE (Through Dec. 17) The American-Scandinavian Foundation's program honoring Greta Garbo's centennial continues on Wednesday with ''Mata Hari'' (1931), in which Garbo plays the World War I spy.

(Gates)    Pop  Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ASHLEE SIMPSON (Sunday) With her engaging demeanor and rock-star pluck, Ashlee Simpson is, despite her early lip-synching woes, fast leaving her sister Jessica behind in the tabloids. As a vocalist, Ashlee can pout, howl and sass it up, which allows her a dimension beyond the spun sugar of teenage pop. 7 p.m., North Fork Theater, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800; $39.50. (Laura Sinagra)    BON JOVI (Monday and Tuesday) Jon Bon Jovi's band conquered the airwaves in the 1980's and 90's by sticking together everything catchy about 70's rock: Bruce Springsteen's earnestness, Led Zeppelin's crunch, Boston's harmonies and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. 7:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741; $49.50 to $99.50. (Jon Pareles)    BRIGHT EYES, FEIST, MAGIC NUMBERS (Tonight and tomorrow) The singer-songwriter Conor Oberst is still perhaps too jittery to resonate as a New Dylan to Old Dylan fans. But his emphatic wisdom, candid political indignance and nuanced wine-soaked laments make him one of the best songwriters of his generation. The warm-voiced Feist is a collaborator of the electroclash queen Peaches and the indie collective Broken Social Scene. Her best songs are quirky, plucked jazz numbers that make her sound like a hipper Norah Jones. London's Magic Numbers, with their diffuse take on 60's harmonies, round out the bill. 8 p.m., Landmark Loews Theater, 54 Journal Square, Jersey City,(866) 468-7619; $25. (Sinagra)    MARSHALL CRENSHAW (Sunday) Marshall Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all, the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Avenue, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Pareles)    RAY DAVIES (Monday) The Kinks singer Ray Davies performs here in connection with a couple of minireleases, one a benefit five-song EP pegged to Thanksgiving Day, reportedly inspired by recent attempts to better understand the United States. One assumes he will also play classics from his band's catalog and tell some stories, too. 8 p.m., Supper Club, 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-1940; $65. (Sinagra)    ROBERTA FLACK (Tomorrow) Behind the gentle, tremulous voice that confided hits like ''The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face'' is long knowledge of the continuum of blues, gospel, soul and jazz. Ms. Flack can use just a touch of rawness to make her songs hit home. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $65.

(Sinagra)    HOT TUNA (Tomorrow) The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from Jefferson Airplane, but it has now long outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis, with Mr. Casady's bass shadowing him from below. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $38.50 to $48.50. (Pareles)    B. B.

(Pareles)    KORN (Tuesday) This band helped popularize a brand of late-90's rock that featured chunky chords and angry raps about childhood mistreatment and the adult fallout. Korn's latest video humorously features rappers Lil Jon, Snoop Dog, Xzibit and David Banner pretending to be the band. 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $37 in advance, $42 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE MENDOZA LINE (Tomorrow) This local band has a knack for deceptively lilting songs with cutting lyrics about betrayal, jealousy and disappointment. Its best choruses turn on phrases like ''It will be the same without you.'' 4 p.m., Sound Fix Records, 110 Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-8090; free. (Sinagra)    METERS (Tonight) Hurricane Katrina could not drown New Orleans syncopation. It lives on with the reunion of the Meters, the definitive New Orleans funk band since 1967. It has backed others, but saved its snappiest, trickiest grooves for its own tracks. With Art Neville on keyboards, George Porter Jr. on bass, Leo Nocentelli on guitar and Joseph Zigaboo Modeliste on drums, they open up nooks and crannies of the beat to carry every hip into irresistible motion. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com, (212) 307-7171; $50.

(Pareles)    AARON NEVILLE (Tomorrow) Aaron Neville of New Orleans's Neville Brothers brings a resolute, pure high vocal quaver to funky R & B, jazz-pop and gospel music, swinging confidently while still conveying heartache.

(Sinagra)    BONNIE RAITT, MARC BROUSSARD (Wednesday and Thursday) Since her days following in the footsteps of blues performers like Sippie Wallace and Son House, Ms. Raitt has been comfortable playing with both rolling funk blues and blues-pop that relies on her clear, wearily emotive voice. Her latest work features stripped down songs about loss and resilience. The rootsy singer Marc Broussard opens. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $40 to $75. (Sinagra)     PATTI SMITH (Wednesday and Thursday) As resolutely pretentious as ever, the punk-poet rocker Patti Smith still has the sinewy swagger to trump young imitators.

(Sinagra)    LADY SOVEREIGN (Wednesday) Few M.C.'s ride the jerky rhythms of grime, a British mix of hip-hop and techno, quite like this adorably brash 17-year-old. Her appearance on this year's ''Run the Road'' compilation (Vice) was one of that excellent album's highlights. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Sinagra)    BILLY SQUIER (Wednesday) Who knew how important the singer-guitarist behind Zeppelin-lite 80's hits like ''Everybody Wants You'' and ''My Kinda Lover'' would be to hip-hop? B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35.(Sinagra)    TOOTS & THE MAYTALS (Sunday) Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)    WE ARE WOLVES (Tomorrow) Among the current wave of Montreal bands, the trio We Are Wolves is less drama clubby than Arcade Fire, fitting more easily into the dance-punk category. 11 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $8. (Sinagra)    Cabaret  Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

(Holden)    STEVE TYRELL (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell has one of those where-have-I-heard-it-before growls that sounds great on a movie soundtrack but loses its charm in a club as he rolls standards off the assembly line as if they were all the same song. 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight and tomorrow night, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $95 tonight and tomorrow; $85 Tuesday and Wednesday; $90 Thursday.

ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET WITH VON FREEMAN (Through Sunday) Mr. Alexander is one of the leading inheritors of a muscular tenor-saxophone style associated with the 1950's; the octogenarian Mr. Freeman, dropping in from his native Chicago, is one of that style's largely unsung but widely influential heroes. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 258-9595; cover: $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Nate Chinen)    DON BYRON PLAYS JUNIOR WALKER (Thursday) Jazz has many card-carrying eclectics these days, but none more self-assured than Don Byron, who'll favor the tenor saxophone rather than his usual clarinet in this tribute to the R & B hero Junior Walker. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover: $20, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    JASON LINDNER BIG BAND (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Lindner, a pianist and composer, is best known for this 10-year-old ensemble, which offers big band traditions with contemporary contours; its ranks include the trumpeter Duane Eubanks, the saxophonist Miguel Zenón and the trombonist-cellist Dana Leong. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover: $15. (Chinen)    * BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO (Through Sunday) With ''Day Is Done'' (Nonesuch), the pianist Brad Mehldau has renovated the sound of his longstanding trio, with considerable help from the powerfully expressive drummer Jeff Ballard; the group's luminous brand of lyricism has survived, but its repertory is more pop-inflected and its rhythmic push more pronounced. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover: $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    * MARIA SCHNEIDER ORCHESTRA (Through Sunday) Last year's ''Concert in the Garden'' (ArtistShare) was a success not only for its Internet-only distribution and subsequent Grammy win; the album bespoke this ensemble's rare cohesive precision, along with the sophistication of Ms. Schneider's compositional language. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover: $25 to $30.

Philippe Auguin conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $320. (Jeremy Eichler)    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Carmen will sell tickets no matter who is in it. Nancy Fabiola Herrera, who got to open the run at the Metropolitan Opera this season, is singing it tomorrow opposite the tenor Marcello Giordani, who should excel as Don José; on Tuesday, Denyce Graves is back in one of her signature roles opposite the tenor Eduardo Villa. Ana Maria Martinez, a young soprano with a burgeoning international career, made her company debut as Micaëla; Erwin Schrott is Escamillo; and Philippe Jordan remains the crisp and able conductor. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Tuesday night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets: $150 to $320 tomorrow, $26 to $320 Tuesday (Anne Midgette).    'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) The big news from the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Gounod's ''Roméo et Juliette,'' is the French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay's remarkable portrayal of Juliette. She sings with uncanny agility and lyrical elegance; her light, rich lyric voice shimmers throughout the house; and she affectingly embodies this tragically impulsive young woman. The tenor Ramón Vargas, though a stiff actor, delivers a vocally impassioned portrayal of Roméo. The Belgian director Guy Joosten's production gives the opera an appropriate Italian Renaissance look, though with surreal touches and some heavy-handed imagery of eternal love amid the starry cosmos. Bertrand de Billy's incisive yet refined conducting of Gounod's most sophisticated score is in every way admirable. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini)    Classical Music    ABSOLUTE ENSEMBLE (Thursday) The conductor Kristjan Jarvi and his free-spirited band invariably present innovative programs, played zestily.

(Kozinn)    BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) The big event at this much-anticipated concert is the return of the fantastic mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, who has cancelled much of her schedule this year because of a back injury, singing the first New York performance of ''Neruda Songs'' by her husband, the composer Peter Lieberson. Taking the measure of James Levine's ongoing renaissance in Boston is the other draw, and Mr. Levine will have plenty of chance to show his stuff in ''Till Eulenspiegel'' and the Mahler Fourth. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $33 to $116 (Midgette).

(Eichler)    SIMONE DINNERSTEIN (Monday) The young American pianist looks back to Bach, in a big way: to be precise, with the Goldberg Variations, a feat of endurance as well as artistry. She's been touring other cities with it and won considerable acclaim, and her unreleased recording is already attracting buzz. Her big, sure, confident playing has been praised in a range of more recent works, from Rochberg to, at this year's Bard Festival, Copland. Check it out. At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15 to $25 (sold out). (Midgette)    WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR (Monday and Tuesday) This superb baritone, with Russel Ryan at the piano, performs music by the Austrian composers Eric Zeisl and Franz Mittler. At 8, the Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, extension 222; free, but reservations are required. (Kozinn)    CHRISTIAN IMMLER (Sunday) This young German baritone makes his New York debut, with Silvia Fraser at the piano, in a program that includes Schumann's ''Dichterliebe'' (Op. 48) and works by Eisler, Ravel, Rankl and Wolf. At 5 p.m., the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700; $20. (Kozinn)    ROBERT LEVIN (Thursday) Equally nimble as a pianist and musicologist, Robert Levin hosts another installment of his ''Mozart Explored'' series of concerts with commentary. This time, it's music for wind instruments. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $40. (Eichler)    NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Lawrence Foster leads the orchestra in works by Enesco and Mendelssohn (the ''Scottish'' Symphony) as well as Beethoven's Second Piano Concerto with the elegant young pianist Jonathan Biss. At 8 p.m., Richardson Auditorium, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (800) 255-3476; $50 to $62. Program repeats tomorrow, Sunday and Tuesday in different locations. (Eichler)    THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow) Dresden's cathedral, the Frauenkirche, was bombed in the war and only restored after German reunification, and the New York Philharmonic has just played in Dresden as part of the reopening celebrations. For the occasion, the British composer Colin Matthews wrote a new piece, ''Berceuse for Dresden,'' for the Philharmonic and a Dresden-based cellist, Jan Vogler, who makes his subscription debut this weekend with this piece and the Schumann cello concerto. Dvorak's New World Symphony rounds out the concert; Lorin Maazel conducts. At 8 p.m. (a matinee of the Dvorak and Dohnanyi's piano quintet, is tomorrow at 2 p.m.), Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92 ($23 to $64 for the matinee). (Midgette)    NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY (Sunday) The concerts by this dynamic orchestra of aspiring young musicians, mostly of high-school age, are never disappointing. The orchestra had a good record of enticing major musicians as soloists, and Sunday afternoon's concert offers Carter Brey, the brilliant principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic, in Dvorak's Cello Concerto. Each concert also presents a premiere by a young composer, and this time it's Ryan Anthony Francis's ''Axiom.'' The conductor Paul Haas ends the program with Beethoven's Fifth. There is nothing like hearing a repertory staple played by thrilled young musicians, many of whom may be playing it for the first time. At 2 p.m., Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $7 to $45. (Tommasini)    PIANO TRIOS PLUS (Tomorrow) Prism Projects presents Piano Trios Plus, a concert of new and recent chamber works on Saturday night. Lots of cutting-edge contemporary concerts seem to take place in churches, especially open-minded parishes like St. Peter's in Chelsea, which has long fostered music of all kinds. On this intriguing program, with Robert Frankenberry piano; Roger Zahab, violin; David Russell, cello; and Tanya Maggi, viola, there will be trios by two of my favorite living composers, Lee Hyla and Judith Weir, more trios by David Keberle and Mr. Zahab, with a piano quartet by Ms. Weir to round out the program. At 7:30 p.m., St. Peter's Church in Chelsea, 346 West 20th Street, (212) 741-0011; $10 at the door. (Tommasini)    QUEEN'S CHAMBER TRIO (Sunday) Marin Marais was the early music flavor of the month for a while in the late 1980's, after his life was explored in the film ''Tous les Matins du Monde'' (''All the Mornings of the World''). His music still turns up regularly in concerts by Jordi Savall and other gambists, but on Sunday it will be played by this slightly updated ensemble, which uses a cello rather than a gamba. In addition to Marais, the group will perform music by Mozart. At 2 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30. (Kozinn)    EARL WILD (Tuesday) Three days after his 90th birthday, the American pianist Earl Wild will celebrate by giving a substantial recital at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Wild, long acclaimed for his nonchalant brand of virtuosity, has lost a little power and precision in recent years. But this summer at the Mannes College of Music he played a difficult program with fluidity, grace, beautiful colorings and lots of panache. For this occasion he offers works by Beethoven, Liszt, Chopin and himself, as well as his own delightful transcriptions of works by Rachmaninoff and Marcello. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15 to $90.

(Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Over all, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    ASIA SOCIETY: 'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -- THE ART OF DINH Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'EDWARD BURTYNSKY: MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck)     * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? These are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, the artists have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in rural Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Its subjects include the depths of human gullibility and the conjuring power of photography, whose technology, we may forget in the cynical day of digital manipulation and Photoshop, seemed unfathomable to so many people a century and more ago. The exhibition's deeper subject is the dreamer in all of us. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)     * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: BEYOND THE VISIBLE: 'THE ART OF ODILON REDON,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART : 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,'  through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    NEUE GALERIE: 'EGON SCHIELE: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    * P.S. 1: 'PETER HUJAR,' through Jan. 16. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter)    * P.S. 1: 'THE PAINTED WORLD,' through Jan. 30. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. (See above.) (Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and mid-size New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above) (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    EDWARD MAYER: 'DRAWING OUT' A single work designed for and occupying the entire front exhibition space of this gallery, ''Drawing Out'' looks both sturdy and fragile, a skeletal open-work modular passageway 18-feet-long, put together as if from a giant Erector set. At once disciplined architecture and intuitive sculptural drawing, the piece invites you to enter and explore it, while conveying a disturbing sense of matter out of place. How often do you get to view a drawing from the inside out? Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street (212) 752-1223, through Dec. 3. (Glueck)    TOM WESSELMANN: 'WORKS ON PAPER, RETROSPECTIVE'  Typed as a Pop artist early on for his portrayals of commercial foodstuffs as well as of stylized women's bodies (or parts thereof) that mingled classic odalisque and sexy pinup, Tom Wesselmann (1931-2004) had other strings to his bow, among them an interest in landscape and, later in his career, large abstract cutouts in metal. His provocative nude icons are here in abundance, but also evident is his interest in Matisse, Picasso and Mondrian. This lively show of 44 works on paper, arranged by his daughter, Kate, also reveals that Wesselmann was a compulsive draftsman, producing and revising many color and compositional studies for his finished works. Maxwell Davidson Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 759-7555, through Dec. 23. (Glueck)    * 'THE WOMEN OF GIACOMETTI' A museum-quality show of paintings and sculptures focuses on Alberto Giacometti's curiously asexual representations of his mother, sister, wife and other women in his life. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through Dec. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    POLLY APFELBAUM: 'CARTOON GARDEN' Give Ms. Apfelbaum credit for trying one of her signature fabric floors without color. Still, though the wide rectangular plot of cartoon blossoms drawn with black markers on pieces of white velvet is graphically lively, the aesthetic payoff as a whole is not worth the sacrifice of color. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Dec. 23.(Johnson)    'THE ART OF CHESS' Updating a historical show of chess sets by mid-20th-century artists on view at the Noguchi Museum, this entertaining exhibition presents fantastic, funky and elegant chess sets designed by, among others, Damien Hirst, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tom Friedman, Paul McCarthy and Yayoi Kusama -- whose optically ravishing set of dotted gourdlike pieces enclosed within a big, leather-clad pumpkin-shaped container steals the show. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through Dec. 23.(Johnson)    * JEREMY BLAKE: 'SODIUM FOX' The best animated video of this innovative artist's career is a dense, briskly based fusion of formalism and underbelly, both indubitably American, propelled by the words and voice of the poet David Berman. Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500, through Dec. 3. (Smith)    * JEREMY COMINS While neither especially original nor current, Mr. Comins's small carved wood sculptures evoke the history of the medium with assured sophistication, impeccable craft and that unmarketable commodity called integrity. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Dec. 10. (Smith)    TRACEY EMIN: 'I CAN FEEL YOUR SMILE' This British artist presents embroideredand stitched works about unrequited love that look as if they were made by a distracted teenage girl and also include an internally lighted tower of sticks that alludes to witch burning. Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2923, through Dec. 17. (Johnson)    BRIAN FINKE: 'MOST MUSCULAR' Whether bodybuilding is a sport, an art form or a neurosis, the physiques of people who have devoted themselves to growing their muscles are always fascinating to see. Mr. Finke's photographs of scantily clad, extraordinarily pumped-up men and women on stage and behind the scenes at competitions are riveting. ClampArt, 531 West 25th Street, (646) 230-0020, through Dec. 17.(Johnson)    MONA HATOUM: 'MOBILE HOME' The playful side of this often politically motivated sculptor prevails. The centerpiece, ''Mobile Home,'' is an arrangement of domestic objects strung on fine cables between metal traffic barriers; it takes a moment to realize that the toys, chairs, suitcases and other items are slowly rolling back and forth on tiny wheels. An installation upstairs consists of a circle of slowly pulsing light bulbs plugged into intricately interwoven cables. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 367-7474, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)    JAMES HAYWARD A veteran Los Angeles-based abstract painter selected for this show by Mike Kelley, Mr. Hayward presents a recent series of single-color paintings made of extremely thick, crisscrossing brush strokes. The optical and tactile combine to exceptionally satisfying effect. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    GARY KUEHN Since the 1960's, Mr. Kuehn has been inventively exploring material dimensions of sculpture while swerving back and forth between pure abstraction and semiabstract representation. This show features paintings that juxtapose gridded colored dots and skittery black lines made by whipping surfaces with ink-soaked lengths of rope. Esso, 531 West 26th Street, (212) 560-9728, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    MEL LEIPZIG A Trenton-based realist who began exhibiting in the mid-1960's, Mr. Leipzig paints affectionate, exhaustively detailed portraits of people in their homes or workplaces with a deliberately unpolished touch. One subject is a man with a shaved head and a goatee relaxing on his living room sofa in the midst of an amazingly extensive collection of sports memorabilia. Henoch, 555 West 25th Street, (917) 305-0003, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    * ANN LISLEGAARD: 'BELLONA (AFTER SAMUEL R. DELANY)' An entrancing animated video based on a famous science-fiction novel tours a mazelike series of empty rooms. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    * JULIA OSCHATZ: 'PARALYZED PARADISE III' A talented artist who is rare for being simultaneously German and female paints, dances and hikes (in video) her way through an impressive multimedia debut in a slyly personalized version of Northern Romanticism. Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450, through Dec. 30. (Smith)    Other Galleries    HANS HOFMANN: 'THE LEGACY' Hofmann was one of the few who made it into the art history hall of fame as both teacher and painter. Along with three works by the master himself, this exhibition presents abstract and semiabstract paintings by disciples who were either directly taught or deeply influenced by him, including Ludwig Sander, Robert De Niro, Louisa Matthiasdottir and Laurie Fendrich. Painting Center, 52 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 343-1060, through Dec. 24. (Johnson)    RAY MORTENSON: 'CEDARS/SEA AND SKY' Alternating between the land and sea of Rhode Island, this quietly gripping show of mostly small black-and-white photographs presents soft and misty images of bushy cedars and extraordinarily clear and luminous pictures of ocean waves. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, through Dec. 4. (Johnson)        * 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith)    Last Chance     * 'IF IT'S TOO BAD TO BE TRUE, IT COULD BE DISINFORMATION' Old-style political art said yes or no, told you what to do. New-style political art, as often as not, obscures its intentions, makes you wonder what it's up to and goes for confusion, as in this shrewd, dematerialized group exhibition on the subject of disinformation, a passive form of political deceit that tells lies through the omission of facts. The idea is that the less people know about what their government is doing, the less likely they are to raise a fuss. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, closing Saturday. (Cotter)    * ANDRÉ KERTESZ From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, closing Sunday. (Johnson)    KIM SIMONSSON Under the influence of Japanese manga cartoons, this Finnish ceramicist makes large, monochromatic sculptures of wide-eyed, otherworldly girls and deer. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212) 242-3013, closing Saturday. (Johnson)    'SYSTEM IN CHAOS: NEW ART BRUT FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC' Four fascinating Czech outsiders: Zdenek Kosek's small, congested bubble diagrams chart unfathomable verbal associations; Lubos Plny's expansive, finely detailed drawings offer delirious lessons in human anatomy; Zbynek Semerak's small, delicately busy works on paper convey what seems to be a medieval iconography of religion and architecture; and Leos Wertheimer's large drawings portray locomotives with mechanical precision. Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3768, closing Saturday. (Johnson)    ROBERT THERRIEN, 'TABLE AND SIX CHAIRS' In a vast corporate atrium stand a table and six chairs that are wholly ordinary-looking except for their gigantic size -- the chair backs rise to almost nine feet, and the top of the table is over six feet. Mr. Therrien transformed his own kitchen furniture into painted metal monuments that make the viewer feel like the protagonist of ''Jack and the Beanstalk.'' The Atrium of 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575, closing Monday.

Doug Hughes directs (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300.    'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Opens Dec. 4. A revival of Horton Foote's drama about a woman longing to return to her childhood home. Directed by the veteran actor Harris Yulin (2:15). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.    Broadway    'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clichés of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley).    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a storyline poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). The August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley).    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp and at over two hours, it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BACH AT LEIPZIG' Itamar Moses's comedy is an ardent but hollow literary homage to Tom Stoppard stuffed with arcana about religious and musical squabbles in 18th-century Germany and knowingly feeble jokes. Despite the nimble gifts of a first-rate cast, the play never works up the farcical energy to lift us over the puddles of book-learning (2:15). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anne Midgette)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Jason Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.( Genzlinger)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'HAMLET' Michael Cumpsty gives a forceful, intelligent reading of the title role in the Classic Stage Company's likably intimate production of Shakespeare's tale of doom-struck Danes. Brian Kulick's production is heavy on the directorial gimmickry (smell the spray paint! watch the set be shredded!), leaving psychology and philosophy to fend for themselves (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HILDA' Marie Ndiaye's play is a psychodrama from which most of the psychology seems to have mysteriously evaporated, taking a lot of the drama with it. Ellen Karas stars as a bourgeois housewife whose obsession with her maid eventually unhinges her (1:20). Part of the Act French Festival. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'JUNIE B. JONES'  A spirited entertainment (1:30). Theaterworks/NYC, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200. (Van Gelder)    'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)    'MEDEA'  The Jean Cocteau Repertory's cliché-ridden modern translation strains to be relevant (1:30). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, near East Second Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' Diminished though it may be by the absence of its orchestra in its 73rd season, it remains prime entertainment (1:30). 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    'SEE WHAT I WANNA TO SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsoke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prizewinning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'BARTLEBY, THE SCRIVENER' Herman Melville's exquisitely existential short story has been beautifully brought to life at the Blue Heron Theater. From the set, which looks like a Victorian illustration, complete with desks with inkpots and plumes, to the characters dressed in antic black-and-white (reminiscent, say, of a Phiz drawing for a Dickens novel) (1:40). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban)    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'COWBOY V. SAMURAI' This adaptation of ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' is set in a small Western town, where an Asian-American English teacher and an Anglo-Saxon gym teacher with cowboy leanings vie for the love of a sophisticated woman (1:45) National Asian American Theater Company, at the Rattlestick theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Jefferson).    'DOÑA ROSITA LA SOLTERA (DOÑA ROSITA THE SPINSTER)' Watching Repertorio Español's ''Dona Rosita the Spinster'' is a bit like finding a dried flower pressed in a book: charming, archaic and just a bit musty, even though the lead is played by Denise Quiñones -- Miss Universe, 2001. Frederico García Lorca's poetic play has a predictable premise; a beautiful young woman waits in vain for the handsome cousin she is engaged to. Luckily, the tragicomedy has some laughs (2:00). In Spanish with live simultaneous translation via headsets. Repertorio Español, at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920.

If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative.

(Brantley)    Last Chance    'CAMBODIA AGONISTES'  A musical about the Khmer Rouge? It works better than you might think in this revival of a 1992 play: Cambodia's recent history is painted in broad strokes of parody intermingled with a tragic story line. But the most vivid performer on stage is a real-life Cambodian dancer, Sam-Ouen Tes, who doesn't have a speaking role but communicates more than this slightly pale though well-meaning piece (1:30).

( Midgette)    'MANIC FLIGHT REACTION' Sarah Schulman's intermittently zingy play is an awkward mixture of cultural satire and earnest psychodrama about love and responsibility.

(Zinoman)    'THE TAMING OF THE SHREW' What could be more apt than the all-female Queen's Company tackling Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew,'' perhaps the most famous war-of-the-sexes comedy ever? But just because Petruchio (and everyone else) is played by a woman doesn't mean that this is a feminist diatribe. In this not very tame production, Bianca is played by an inflatable doll (1:50).

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AFTER INNOCENCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) Calm, deliberate and devastating, Jessica Sanders's documentary ''After Innocence'' examines the cases of seven men wrongly convicted of murder and rape and exonerated years later by DNA evidence. It confirms many of your worst fears about the weaknesses of the American criminal justice system. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis)    'BROOKLYN LOBSTER' (No rating, 90 minutes) Kitchen-sink neorealism set in Sheepshead Bay: although well acted by Danny Aiello and Jane Curtin, too much of the film plays like a tedious case history from a business school textbook. (Holden)    'CAPE OF GOOD HOPE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) Set in gorgeous Cape Town, Mark Bamford's energizing first feature revolves around a group of animal-shelter workers and their significant counterparts, as they contend with varying states of loneliness and gaping voids in their lives. A genuinely uplifting, satisfying and memorable film. (Laura Kern)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)    'DERAILED' (R, 110 minutes) A glossy and often risible bit of trash about an adulterous affair gone bad, bad, bad, starring the invaluable Clive Owen and an uncomfortable-looking Jennifer Aniston. (Dargis)    * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter Off Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife and a young screenwriter. (Holden)    'ELLIE PARKER' (No rating, 95 minutes) This corrosive deadpan comedy, crudely filmed in digital video, follows the misadventures of an aspiring actress in Los Angeles. Naomi Watts, in the title role, delivers a small, brave, acting tour de force. (Holden)    'GAY SEX IN THE 70's' (No rating, 72 minutes) Joseph Lovett's nostalgic paean to the erotic utopia of his youth might be more accurately titled ''Anonymous Gay Male Sex in the 70's in Manhattan.'' Within that narrow framework, the film is quite successful, using archival photographs, clips from pornographic films and television commercials, and interviews to evoke the period between June 1969, when the Stonewall riots brought homosexuality out of the shadows, to June 1981, when the AIDS epidemic began. (Dana Stevens)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warm-hearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the first gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of Los Angeles. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)    'THE LEGEND OF ZORRO' (PG, 126 minutes) Like most sequels, this successor to ''The Mask of Zorro'' feels obliged to outperform its forerunner by being bigger, faster and more spectacular. That translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic. (Holden)    * 'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)    'NORTH COUNTRY' (R, 123 minutes) A wobbly fiction about a real pioneering sex-discrimination case, ''North Country'' is an unabashed vehicle for its modestly de-glammed star, Charlize Theron, but it's also a star vehicle with heart -- an old-fashioned liberal weepie about truth and justice. (Dargis)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'PRIME' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Actually, pretty mediocre. A thin romantic comedy that nonetheless has its charms, most of them provided by Uma Thurman as a divorced 37-year-old who falls for a 23-year-old who happens to be her therapist's son. (Scott)    'SAW II' (R, 91 minutes) Jigsaw, the sicko known for masterminding twisted life-or-death games, returns for a sequel that doesn't really compare to its fine predecessor, though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself. (Kern)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)    'THE WEATHER MAN' (R, 102 minutes) Yet another movie about a middle-age man gazing into the void of his life; this one was directed by Gore Verbinski and features a fine Nicolas Cage.(Dargis)    'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    CHILDREN IN THE 20TH CENTURY (Through Tuesday) Symphony Space Thalia Film's international program of films focusing on problems that affect children concludes with Luis Buñuel's first international hit, ''Los Olvidados'' (1950), about a teenager in the slums of Mexico City, and Victor Gaviria's ''Rodrigo D: No Futuro'' (1990), about a teenager in the slums of Medellín, Colombia. Both films will be shown on Sunday and Tuesday, Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10. (Anita Gates)    GENA ROWLANDS: AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT (Through Sunday) This series from BAMcinématek concludes this weekend with three 1980's films. In ''Tempest'' (1982), Paul Mazursky's Shakespearean adaptation, Ms. Rowlands stars with John Cassavetes, her husband, as a modern Prospero's wife. In Woody Allen's ''Another Woman'' (1988), she plays a New Yorker who eavesdrops on psychotherapy sessions. And in ''Love Streams'' (1984), the last film in which she and Cassavetes appeared together, they play a brother and sister struggling with their lives. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    A LUMINOUS CENTURY: CELEBRATING NORWEGIAN CINEMA (Through Nov. 29) The Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Norwegian Film Institute have organized this 29-film program representing Norway's century-old movie industry. This weekend's films include Leif Sinding's ''Defenceless'' (1939), about orphans used as slave labor on farms; ''An Enemy of the People'' (2005), Erik Skjoldbjoerg's update of Ibsen's classic; Arne Skouen's ''Nine Lives'' (1957), about the World War II hero Jan Baalsrud; and ''Next Door'' (2005), Pal Sletaune's dark comedy about a young man's very strange neighbors. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    A MOVING CAMERA: KENJI MIZOGUCHI (Through Tuesday) BAMcinématek's series of seven films by Mizoguchi (1898-1956), renowned for his painterly filmmaking and his brilliant direction of women, concludes with a prewar masterpiece and Mizoguchi's last film. Monday's feature is ''The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum'' (1939), about the doomed relationship of a kabuki actor and a servant girl. Tuesday's is ''Street of Shame'' (1956), sympathetic overlapping portraits of prostitutes in postwar Tokyo. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    NO VISA REQUIRED: FILMS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST (Through tomorrow) The TriBeCa Film Institute and ArteEast's program concludes tomorrow with ''The Lizard'' (2004), an Iranian comedy about an escaped convict who disguises himself as a mullah. Cantor Film Center, New York University, 36 East Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 941-3890; $10. (Gates)    POETRY AND RIGOR: THE FILMS OF GIANNI AMELIO (Through Nov. 30) The Museum of Modern Art and Cinecittà Holding are sponsoring an exhibition of 12 films, beginning tonight with ''Stolen Children'' (1992), introduced by Mr. Amelio, the Cannes Film Festival grand jury prizewinner about a policeman transporting two siblings to an orphanage. Other films this weekend include ''Lamerica'' (1994), Mr. Amelio's neorealist drama set in post-Communist Albania; and ''The Keys to the House'' (2004), about a father reunited with his disabled son. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    RYAN ADAMS AND THE CARDINALS (Tonight) Seemingly reinvigorated by his new band, the prolific (and hotheaded) alt-country songwriter Ryan Adams has some strong new material that offers stylistic restlessness as a sign of depth and demonstrates his honky-tonk versatility. 8, TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 509-0300; free with ticket (details at www.musicdowntown.org). (Laura Sinagra)    AMERICAN ANALOG SET (Tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday) A more ethereal version of Death Cab for Cutie, this Austin band plays wistful, conspiratorial pop that's more hum than drone. The group has said this tour will be its last. Tonight at 9, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $14 (sold out). Tomorrow at 10 p.m., Sunday at 11 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sinagra)    ANIMAL COLLECTIVE (Sunday) These moody junkyard folk-poppers find a kind of romance in wails and clatter. Their cracked prog jams and urban pastoral chant-alongs map a landscape where fantastical beasts gather for ritual rocking around trashcan campfires. Excepter and Amandine also play. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    INDIA.ARIE, RAUL MIDON (Tonight) India.Arie's combination of soul and folk stylings and be-yourself uplift paved the way for groups like Floetry. The vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Raul Midon has contributed his talents to the work of many Latin pop superstars. He plays his own material here. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $45. (Sinagra)    BUJU BANTON (Tuesday) Buju Banton is possessed of one of the best voices and hit catalogs in dancehall. Unfortunately, the purveyor of the anti-gay screed ''Boom Bye Bye'' can't seem to leave the topic alone, as he proved at this summer's Reggae Carifest. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sinagra)    CLEM SNIDE (Tonight) Though Clem Snide's nasal wiseacre frontman Eef Barzelay increasingly shows his soft side with pretty tunes influenced by love and fatherhood, this Brooklyn indie rocker hasn't lost his trademark snark. Tonight, he's playing solo. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE CLIENTELE (Wednesday) This London indie-pop group fills out its sound on recent material, adding strings to its formula -- a mix of modern ironic poses with wistful nostalgia for classic rock 'n' roll and AM radio trifles. Annie Hayden opens. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $14. (Sinagra)    DONNA THE BUFFALO (Tomorrow) Donna the Buffalo is not named after its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins. Its good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country music, though it also dips into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    ECHO & THE BUNNYMEN (Sunday) Goth rock never goes out of style, but its current boost is good for the Echo and the Bunnymen frontman Ian McCulloch, one of the genre's first legitimate babes. The band has new songs but will appease black-clad fans with agitated favorites like ''The Cutter'' and ''The Killing Moon.'' Innaway opens. 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    ROBBIE FULKS, JON SPENCER (Tonight) The latest album by Chicago's country curveballer Robbie Fulks again prompts head shaking as to why this off-off-Opry wiseacre isn't a more famous songwriter (or at least a little bigger and richer). As alt-country fans know, he's a crackerjack guitarist and a charismatic performer to boot. The alt-punk bluesman Jon Spencer also plays, with his band Heavy Trash. 7:30, Housing Works Used Book Cafe, 126 Crosby Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3324; $25. (Sinagra)    GUSTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Guster, a band from Boston, has followed the Dave Matthews Band's playbook for building an audience: touring constantly and singing unabashedly earnest folk-rock songs about the painful uncertainties of friendship, love and growing up. 8, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171;$35. (Pareles)    H.I.M. (Tonight) This Finnish goth rock band's bid for Stateside success has been the pet cause of TV skate-rat Bam Margera. Now it finally gets a chance to show off its metallic riffs and the infernal majesty of the singer Ville Valo , who wears his ''heartagram'' (the band's romantically satanic heart and pentagram symbol) on his sleeve. Finch and Skindred also play. 6, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740; $28. (Sinagra)    IDA, MICHAEL HURLEY (Sunday) With their dreamy folk-pop, the trio Ida combine aching harmonies and a supple sense of play. They perform this free in-store show with one of their quirky antecedents, the folkie Michael Hurley. 7 p.m., Sound Fix Records, 110 Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-8090; free. (Sinagra)    RICKIE LEE JONES, VIC CHESNUTT (Tomorrow) Ms. Jones's Southwestern hippie roots give her urban-bohemian jazz leanings a trippy whimsy. You hope this outdoor set will cull from both the swooping multipartite reveries and the ersatz streetcorner jive of her 1970's releases, as well as the best of her songful later albums. Recent material by the Southern Gothic storyteller Vic Chesnutt leans to his darker side. 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 509-0300; free with ticket (details at www.musicdowntown.org). (Sinagra)    LCD SOUNDSYSTEM (Wednesday) With songs like ''Losing My Edge'' and ''Daft Punk Is Playing at My House,'' the Brooklyn producer and LCD leader James Murphy has proven himself a talented practitioner and master theorist of retro-chic sound, especially the current vogue for refashioning early 80's ''dance-punk.'' 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20. (Sinagra)    AIMEE MANN, KEREN ANN (Sunday) Ms. Mann's recent concept album about two addicts in the 70's who meet at the Virginia fairgrounds features the astute, sad lyrics and low-key but enduring melodic hooks that this singer-songwriter is known for. The chanteuse Keren Ann applies her velvety voice to jazz-inflected, rainy day urban valentines. Her lolling tunes ponder love and travel, admitting that the strongest memory of a visited place is often the homesickness endured there. 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 509-0300; free with ticket (details at www.musicdowntown.org). (Sinagra)    RHETT MILLER (Tuesday and Wednesday) The leader of the once cocky and speedy, then honest and rootsy rock band the Old 97's, Rhett Miller is still writing near-genius tunes though he often leans on formal craft. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200; $20. (Tuesday sold out) (Sinagra)    SHARAM NAZERI (Sunday) Mr. Nazeri holds listeners rapt as he sings Kurdish songs, Persian classical music and Sufi songs based on the poems of Rumi; his voice can take on the humble clarity of Gregorian chant, or it can leap and swoop and ululate. 7 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536; $30 to $50. (Pareles)    NEW SOUNDS FROM POLAND (Tomorrow) This glimpse into new Polish music features sets by the accordion-based group the Motion Trio, and Lautari, an improvisatory ensemble inspired by folk traditions of Poland, Romania and Macedonia. 8 p.m., Peter Norton Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)    THE NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tonight) The Southern rock band North Mississippi All-Stars plays an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the hill country near where the members grew up, then turn it into jam-band music. 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)    SAM CHAMPION (Tuesday) Local indie rock has been largely dominated by neo-formalist technicians as of late, making this quartet's looser approach, which harkens back to the slacker ennui epitomized by Pavement, a welcome addition. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    RICHARD SHINDELL, LUCY KAPLANSKY (Tonight) In Richard Shindell's character studies, finely observed details suddenly add up to a larger picture that can be compassionate or troubling; he writes about a Civil War widow, an interrogator trying to turn a witness, a fugitive phoning his family. Lucy Kaplansky shares the bill. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32 to $38 (sold out). (Pareles)    CARLY SIMON, BEN TAYLOR, SALLY TAYLOR (Tuesday) Carly Simon's hits like ''Anticipation'' and ''You're So Vain'' endure as evergreen go-girl inspirationals. She plays after opening sets by her children Ben and Sally Taylor. 8 p.m., Jazz at Lincoln Center, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Time Warner Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800; $95 to $150. (Sinagra)    TRISTEZA (Tonight) This San Diego band plays instrumental music that augments rock with electronica. 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra)    U2, PATTI SMITH (Monday and Tuesday) After 2000's thrilling ''All That You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), U2's ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope) focuses on what humans can live without: namely, intercontinental ballistic missiles and third-world debt. The punk rock icon Patti Smith convenes her band to show young acolytes like the Fiery Furnaces how it's done in this year marking the 30th anniversary of her incendiary, poetic album ''Horses'' (Arista). 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741: $54 to $169.50. (Sinagra)    UMPHREY'S MCGEE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Umphrey's McGee has twin guitars and some jam-band roots, but its songs are more elaborate than the usual head-bobbing vamps; they're full of meter-shifting convolutions and jazzy twists that move close to progressive rock. 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $22.50, $25 at the door.

Opera    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) She's back. After an initial flurry of less well-known Carmens at the Met this season, Denyce Graves is taking up one of her signature roles for a run of performances into December.

(Anne Midgette)    'THE LITTLE PRINCE' (Today, tomorrow and Sunday) Francesca Zambello's production, with bright, sure sets by Maria Bjornson, is gorgeous. And Rachel Portman's opera is opulent, with a veritably lush orchestra and a large children's chorus. All of this is an odd fit for the spareness of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's beloved book, which inspired it, but it makes for a colorful spectacle -- though it would lose nothing by being half an hour shorter. Tonight at 8, Saturday and Sunday afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $79 tonight, $25 to $65 tomorrow and $45 to $65 on Sunday.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; 65+, students and children, $25. (Midgette)    'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow) If your idea of a stimulating evening is watching a beefy and clearly none too intelligent prince devoting himself singlemindedly to winning the heart of a creepy harridan -- and, O.K., singing ''Nessun Dorma'' along the way -- the company's venerable Beni Montresor staging (now directed by Beth Greenberg) is back on the boards. Its strong cast includes Lori Phillips in the title role, Philip Webb as Calaf and Guylaine Girard as Liù. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $120.

This young soprano, an alumna of the Met's Lindemann program and already presented in New York by the Marilyn Horne Foundation, won first place in the Young Concert Artists auditions this year, and as a result is giving her Carnegie recital debut with a program of Purcell, Richard Strauss, Schumann and others.

(Kozinn)    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow and Sunday) Arguing that although public church performances of the time were sung by men, women sang sacred music in convents and secular music at court, this venerable ensemble has taken to presenting an annual concert sung and played by women.

(Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck)    * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Its subjects include the depths of human gullibility and the conjuring power of photography, whose technology, we may forget in the cynical day of digital manipulation and Photoshop, seemed unfathomable to so many people a century and more ago. The exhibition's deeper subject is the dreamer in all of us. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * Museum of Modern Art : 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,'  through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits and drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through Jan. 16. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demi-monde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still-lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter)    * P.S. 1: 'The Painted World,' through Jan. 30. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. (See above.) (Johnson)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck)    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years, Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above) (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    EDWARD MAYER: 'DRAWING OUT' A single work designed for and occupying the entire front exhibition space of this gallery, ''Drawing Out'' looks both sturdy and fragile, a skeletal open-work modular passageway 18-feet-long, put together as if from a giant Erector set. At once disciplined architecture and intuitive sculptural drawing, the piece invites you to enter and explore it, while conveying a disturbing sense of matter out of place. How often do you get to view a drawing from the inside out? Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street (212) 752-1223, through Dec. 3. (Glueck)    TOM WESSELMANN: 'WORKS ON PAPER, RETROSPECTIVE'  Typed as a Pop artist early on for his portrayals of commercial foodstuffs as well as of stylized women's bodies (or parts thereof) that mingled classic odalisque and sexy pinup, Tom Wesselmann (1931-2004) had other strings to his bow, among them an interest in landscape and, later in his career, large abstract cutouts in metal. His provocative nude icons are here in abundance, but also evident is his interest in Matisse, Picasso and Mondrian. This lively show of 44 works on paper, arranged by his daughter, Kate, also reveals that Wesselmann was a compulsive draftsman, producing and revising many color and compositional studies for his finished works. Maxwell Davidson Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 759-7555, through Dec. 23. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    Mona Hatoum: 'Mobile Home' The playful side of this often politically motivated sculptor prevails. The centerpiece, ''Mobile Home,'' is an arrangement of domestic objects strung on fine cables between metal traffic barriers; it takes a moment to realize that the toys, chairs, suitcases and other items are slowly rolling back and forth on tiny wheels. An installation upstairs consists of a circle of slowly pulsing light bulbs plugged into intricately interwoven cables. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 367-7474, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)    James Hayward A veteran Los Angeles-based abstract painter selected for this show by Mike Kelley, Mr. Hayward presents a recent series of single-color paintings made of extremely thick, crisscrossing brush strokes. The optical and tactile combine to exceptionally satisfying effect. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    Mel Leipzig A Trenton-based realist who began exhibiting in the mid-1960's, Mr. Leipzig paints affectionate, exhaustively detailed portraits of people in their homes or workplaces with a deliberately unpolished touch. One subject is a man with a shaved head and a goatee relaxing on his living room sofa in the midst of an amazingly extensive collection of sports memorabilia. Henoch, 555 West 25th Street, (917) 305-0003, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    * Ann Lislegaard: 'Bellona (after Samuel R. Delany)' An entrancing animated video based on a famous science-fiction novel tours a mazelike series of empty rooms. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    Kim Simonsson Under the influence of Japanese manga cartoons, this Finnish ceramicist makes large, monochromatic sculptures of wide-eyed, otherworldly girls and deer. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212) 242-3013, through Nov. 26. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    Hans Hofmann: 'The Legacy' Hofmann was one of the few who made it into the art history hall of fame as both teacher and painter. Along with three works by the master himself, this exhibition presents abstract and semi-abstract paintings by disciples who were either directly taught or deeply influenced by him, including Ludwig Sander, Robert De Niro, Louisa Matthiasdottir and Laurie Fendrich. The Painting Center, 52 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 343-1060, through Dec. 24. (Johnson)    * 'If It's Too Bad to Be True, It Could Be Disinformation' Old-style political art said yes or no, told you what to do. New-style political art, as often as not, obscures its intentions, makes you wonder what it's up to and goes for confusion, as in this shrewd, dematerialized group exhibition on the subject of disinformation, a passive form of political deceit that tells lies through the omission of facts. The idea is that the less people know about what their government is doing, the less likely they are to raise a fuss. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through Nov. 26. (Cotter)    * André KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)    Ray Mortenson: 'Cedars/Sea and Sky' Alternating between the land and sea of Rhode Island, this quietly gripping show of mostly small black-and-white photographs presents soft and misty images of bushy cedars and extraordinarily clear and luminous pictures of ocean waves. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, through Dec. 4. (Johnson)    * 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith)    'System in Chaos: New Art Brut From the Czech Republic' Four fascinating Czech outsiders: Zdenek Kosek's small, congested bubble diagrams chart unfathomable verbal associations; Lubos Plny's expansive, finely detailed drawings offer delirious lessons in human anatomy; Zbynek Semerak's small, delicately busy works on paper convey what seems to be a medieval iconography of religion and architecture; and Leos Wertheimer's large drawings portray locomotives with mechanical precision. Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3768, through Nov. 26. (Johnson)    Robert Therrien, 'Table and Six Chairs' In a vast corporate atrium stand a table and six chairs that are wholly ordinary-looking except for their gigantic size -- the chair backs rise to almost nine feet, and the top of the table is over six feet. Mr. Therrien transformed his own kitchen furniture into painted metal monuments that make the viewer feel like the protagonist of ''Jack and the Beanstalk.'' The Atrium of 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575, through Nov. 28. (Johnson)    Last Chance    'Eighth Annual International Juried Botanical Art Exhibition' The old-fashioned art of botanical illustration lives on, as evinced by this selection of finely made drawings and watercolors by more than 40 artists. Many are routinely competent, but some, like a small, intense picture of a gnarly root ball by Jean Emmons, are remarkable for both what and how they represent. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, closing tomorrow . (Johnson)    'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, closing on Wednesday. (Johnson)    'PLAIN OF HEAVEN' Organized by Creative Time, this show of mostly site-specific installations insinuates a reverberating, poetic Minimalism into the darkened spaces of a former meatpacking plant. The efforts of Corey McCorkle, O. Winston Link, Leandro Erlich, Helen Mirra, Gordon Matta-Clark, William Forsythe and Saskia Olde-Wolbers are noteworthy. A sound piece by Trisha Donnelly will engulf the building for the last 20 minutes of the show's run. 832 Washington Street, at Gansevoort Street, West Village, (212) 206-6674, closing on Sunday.

Broadway    'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clichés of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley).    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by pop repackager Des McAnuff (""The Who's Tommy""). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a storyline poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). The August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley).    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. The thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of ten who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anne Midgette)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Jason Zinoman)    'CAMBODIA AGONISTES'  A musical about the Khmer Rouge? It works better than you might think in this revival of a 1992 play: Cambodia's recent history is painted in broad strokes of parody intermingled with a tragic story line. But the most vivid performer on stage is a real-life Cambodian dancer, Sam-Ouen Tes, who doesn't have a speaking role but communicates more than this slightly pale though well-meaning piece (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 279-4200. Pan Asian Repertory Theater, at the West End Theater, in the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, 263 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200.( Midgette).    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Neil Genzlinger)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'MANIC FLIGHT REACTION' Sarah Schulman's intermittently zingy play is an awkward mixture of cultural satire and earnest psychodrama about love and responsibility. Deirdre O'Connell gives a warm, engaging performance as a reformed rebel with a colorful past that bleeds into the present in sensational ways (2:00). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)    'MEDEA'  The Jean Cocteau Repertory's cliché-ridden modern translation strains to be relevant (1:30). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, near East Second Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle, for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' Diminished though it may be by the absence of its orchestra in its 73rd season, it remains prime entertainment (1:30). 50th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'SEE WHAT I WANNA TO SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsoke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prizewinning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'ASHLEY MONTANA GOES ASHORE IN THE CAICOS, OR: WHAT AM I DOING HERE?' A revue of satiric songs and sketches by Roger Rosenblatt that seeks to comment on the state of the national psyche. It's not good, apparently, but what's new? A bright cast keeps things lively, but Mr. Rosenblatt's targets are mostly moldy (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101 (Isherwood)    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'THE SALVAGE SHOP' Jim Nolan's moving, old fashioned drama, about a fraught father-and-son relationship in a small coastland town in Ireland, delivers an emotional punch (2:30). The Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25).

(Brantley)    * 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' This one-hour children's musical by composer Stephen Schwartz (""Wicked"") has such terrific music and singing you almost don't mind the clumsy dialogue and dime-store sets (1:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Miriam Horn)    'CATHAY: THREE TALES OF CHINA' Joins puppetry, film and animation. The director-writer Ping Chong and the Shaanxi Folk Theater of China have created enchanting and moving theater (1:40). New Victory, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Jefferson)    'KARLA' The decks are stacked in Steve Earle's play about the death row inmate Karla Faye Tucker. It is strong on heartfelt narrative, but equally strong on preachy sentiment and wishfulness (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, closing Sunday.(Phoebe Hoban)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Jefferson)    'NORMAL' A misguided musical about a youngster's battle with anorexia and the stress it puts on her family. Gag (1:40). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)    '. . . SHE SAID' Inspired by Marguerite Duras's coldly erotic, deeply ambiguous novel ""Destroy, She Said,"" this multi-media production directed by Ivan Talijancic is a visual gem whose luster is unfortunately dulled by a needlessly frustrating textual overlay (45 minutes). Part of the Act French Festival. The Brooklyn Lyceum, 227 Fourth Avenue, Park Slope, (212) 780-3372, closing on Sunday.(Jonathan Kalb)    'SLUT'  This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AFTER INNOCENCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) Calm, deliberate and devastating, Jessica Sanders's documentary ''After Innocence'' examines the cases of seven men wrongly convicted of murder and rape and exonerated years later by DNA evidence. It confirms many of your worst fears about the weaknesses of the American criminal justice system. (Stephen Holden)    'BROOKLYN LOBSTER' (No rating, 90 minutes) Kitchen-sink neorealism set in Sheepshead Bay: although well acted by Danny Aiello and Jane Curtin, too much of the film plays like a tedious case history from a business school textbook. (Holden)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)    * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter off-Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson, and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife, and a young screenwriter. (Holden)    'G' (R, 97 minutes) The decadent world of Hamptonite hip-hop moguls is the backdrop for this somewhat faithful but not very graceful retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.'' Soapy but well acted. (Laura Kern)    'GAY SEX IN THE 70's' (No rating, 72 minutes) Joseph Lovett's nostalgic paean to the erotic utopia of his youth might be more accurately titled ''Anonymous Gay Male Sex in the 70's in Manhattan.'' Within that narrow framework, the film is quite successful. (Dana Stevens)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about Marines in the first Gulf War, waiting for action is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- -even more strangely given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of L.A. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)    'LA SIERRA' (No rating, 84 minutes, in Spanish) In their courageous documentary, ''La Sierra,'' the filmmakers Scott Dalton and Margarita Martinez take us to a small community in Medellín where an illegal right-wing paramilitary group holds power. When not fighting leftist guerrillas or settling local disputes, the young men -- ''kids with guns,'' grumbles one elderly resident -- strut their stuff for local girls whose astonishing fecundity seems like a desperate bid to replace the dead. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'THE LEGEND OF ZORRO' (PG, 126 minutes) Like most sequels, this successor to ''The Mask of Zorro'' feels obliged to outperform its forerunner by being bigger, faster and more spectacular. That translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic. (Holden)    * 'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)    'NORTH COUNTRY' (R, 123 minutes) A wobbly fiction about a real pioneering sex-discrimination case, ''North Country'' is an unabashed vehicle for its modestly de-glammed star, Charlize Theron, but it's also a star vehicle with heart -- an old-fashioned liberal weepie about truth and justice. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    'PRIME' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Actually, pretty mediocre. A thin romantic comedy that nonetheless has its charms, most of them provided by Uma Thurman as a divorced 37-year-old who falls for a 23-year old who happens to be her therapist's son. (Scott)    'SAW II' (R, 91 minutes) Jigsaw, the sicko known for masterminding twisted life-or-death games, returns for a sequel that doesn't really compare to its fine predecessor, though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself. (Kern)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'THE SWENKAS' (No rating, 72 minutes, in English and Zulu) Every Saturday night in downtown Johannesburg, a group of poor, black, South African men engage in a ritualistic fashion show known as ''swanking.'' Dressed in hats and designer suits, they compete for prizes and promote an ethic of cleanliness and self-respect. And what working stiff doesn't itch to become a peacock on a Saturday night? (Catsoulis)    'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble.

(Chinen)    * TOOTS THIELEMANS AND KENNY WERNER (Tuesday through Nov. 20) The Dutch harmonica master Toots Thielemans and the American pianist Kenny Werner have recorded fruitfully together in recent years; here they focus on Brazilian music, an area of specialty for Mr. Thielemans, in an all-star ensemble featuring the guitarist Oscar Castro-Neves and the percussionist Airto Moreira. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables and a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    * BEBO VALDÉS (Through Sunday) Mr. Valdés, a pianist, composer and legend of Cuban music, won a Latin Grammy last week for his superlative album ''Bebo de Cuba'' (Calle 54); he is making a rare club appearance with the Spanish bassist Javier Colina, who played on another recent album, ''Lágrimas Negras'' (Calle 54). 9 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum (sold out). (Chinen)    BEN WALTZER QUARTET (Tomorrow) Mr. Waltzer, the pianist, manages a thoughtful modernism that coexists more than peaceably with an unself-conscious swing; his colleagues here include the expansive tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby and the incisive drummer Eric McPherson. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'AIDA' (Tomorrow) The casting of the major roles in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Verdi's ever-popular ''Aida'' has changed completely since Sonja Frisell's production returned to the house last month. The Armenian soprano Hasmik Papian, who made her 1999 Met debut as Aida, portrays the Ethiopian princess, with the earthy Swiss mezzo-soprano Yvonne Naef as Amneris and the sturdy American tenor Franco Farina as Radames. Fans of the imposing baritone Mark Delavan, a longtime star of the New York City Opera, will be happy to see him back at the Met as Amonasro. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220.(Anthony Tommasini)    'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The Metropolitan Opera's perennial holiday favorite is back, fitted out with a cast that includes a couple of veterans -- Ruth Ann Swenson as Mimi and Frank Lopardo as Rodolfo -- and a couple of able younger singers on their way to becoming Met fixtures, Emily Pulley as Musetta and Earle Patriarco as Schaunard. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Tuesday night at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Anne Midgette)    'GIOVANNA D'ARCO' (Wednesday) Vincent La Selva is a far better conductor than the size and stature of his company, the New York Grand Opera, might lead one to infer. Verdi is his specialty: he staged all of that composer's operas in chronological order over eight summers in Central Park, recorded a fine disc of Verdi overtures and is now bringing Verdi's early Joan of Arc opera for his annual presentation in Carnegie Hall. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $65. (Midgette)    'THE LITTLE PRINCE' (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) Rachel Portman's modest and charming operatic setting gets a Francesca Zambello production at the New York City Opera. Tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Bernard Holland)    'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' (Wednesday) Britten's adaptation of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' may be his most overlooked masterpiece. This extraordinary opera, with some of Britten's most intricate, subtle and wondrous music, taps right into the dark and ominous underside of Shakespeare's deceptively fanciful play. The Juilliard Opera Center presents a fully-staged production with the British conductor David Atherton, an insightful and experienced Britten interpreter, leading the Juilliard Theater Orchestra. 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Tommasini)    'le NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Tonight and Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's airy, uncluttered production affords Mozart's music ample room to breathe. The cast is solid though not exceptional and includes Luca Pisaroni, Lisa Milne, Peter Mattei, Hei-Kyung Hong and Joyce DiDonato. Mark Wigglesworth conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205. (Jeremy Eichler)    'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' (Monday and Thursday) The news of this new production of Gounod's sweet Shakespeare setting is the return to the Metropolitan Opera of the French soprano Natalie Dessay, hailed here for excellent Olympias and Zerbinettas, but occasionally sidelined with vocal woes. Partnering her is Ramón Vargas in a production mounted by a team of Met first-timers led by the director Guy Joosten. Betrand de Billy conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $250. (Midgette)    'TURANDOT' (Wednesday) If your idea of a stimulating evening is watching a beefy and clearly none too intelligent prince devoting himself singlemindedly to winning the heart of a creepy harridan -- and, O.K., singing ''Nessun Dorma'' along the way -- the company's venerable Beni Montresor staging (now directed by Beth Greenberg) is back on the boards, with a strong cast that includes Lori Phillips in the title role, Philip Webb as Calaf and Guylaine Girard as Liù. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120.(Allan Kozinn)    'WILLIAM TELL' (Sunday) Rossini's last opera, a swashbuckling epic about the Swiss patriot William Tell, is known almost exclusively for one perky section of its four-part overture, immortalized as the theme song for ''The Lone Ranger.'' That this rich and sweeping opera is seldom performed is probably due to the difficulty of the leading roles, especially Arnold, Tell's co-conspirator, a tenor part strewn through high C's and even a high D flat. Marcello Giordani takes it on in a concert performance with the Opera Orchestra on New York, Eve Queler conducting. The baritone Marco Chingari sings the title role, and the soprano Angela Maria Blasi is Princess Mathilde. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)    'ZAZÀ' (Tomorrow) Leoncavallo's turn-of-the-century opera was a big hit at the Met in the 1920's and Teatro Grattacielo returns it to New York, featuring the soprano Aprile Millo. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $85. (Holland)    Classical Music    MARIE-CLAIRE ALAIN (Thursday) This French organist surveys music by Bach, Campion, Franck and others. 8 p.m., Church of the Holy Trinity, 316 East 88th Street, Manhattan, (212) 289-4100; $20, students and 65+, $15. (Eichler)    AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) In the first concert of its season, this enterprising new-music orchestra and its music director, Steven Sloane, explore different kinds of musical motion, from the hyperactive writing, originally for player piano, in Conlon Nancarrow's Study No. 7, to Michael Torke's deconstruction and reassembly of biblical lines in ''Proverbs.'' 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $27 to $35. (Kozinn)    THE ENGLISH CONCERT (Monday) This once pioneering period-instrument group has been re-energized by the firebrand violinist Andrew Manze. Here Mr. Manze sandwiches works by Heinrich Biber between his own reconstructions of putative ''original'' versions of two of Bach's orchestral suites. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42 to $55. (James R. Oestreich)    HILARY HAHN (Thursday) This noted young violinist plays Mozart and Beethoven sonatas with the pianist Natalie Zhu, along with flashy works by Ysae, Milstein and Enescu. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $69. (Eichler)    CHU-FANG HUANG (Wednesday) This young pianist, a finalist at the Cliburn Competition in June, went on to win the Cleveland Competition in August. Here she plays works by Haydn, Chopin, Liszt and Huang Ruo. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15. (Oestreich)    JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) James Conlon leads this student orchestra in a pleasingly symmetrical program: Stravinsky's Violin Concerto and Scherzo Fantastique opposite Britten's Piano Concerto and ''Four Sea Interludes.'' 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Eichler)    JOEL KROSNICK AND GILBERT KALISH (Thursday) The cellist Joel Krosnick and the pianist Gilbert Kalish have won deserved acclaim for their riveting accounts of contemporary music. But this respected duo has long played a wide repertory of works. They present an all-Beethoven program, with three sets of variations for cello and piano, and the two early cello sonatas, No. 1 in F and No. 2 in G minor. 8 p.m., Paul Hall, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Tommasini)    GYORGY LIGETI (Tomorrow) Picking the greatest living composer may be a pointless critical speculation. But my choice would be Gyorgy Ligeti, the Hungarian-born master, now 82, who is being celebrated by the Miller Theater this fall in a Ligeti Festival of films and concerts. In the final concert, Jennifer Koh performs Mr. Ligeti's restless and stunningly original Violin Concerto with a new cadenza by, of all people, that iconoclastic composer with a pop music following, John Zorn. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway and 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20. (Tommasini)    'MOZART -- SOUL OF GENIUS: BARBARA BONNEY SINGS MOZART' (Tonight and Sunday) The title of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's yearlong celebration of Mozart tells only part of the story of this concert: Wolfgang Amadeus is the draw, but not the sole focus of a concert devoted to music by him, his father and his son; and Barbara Bonney is not the only singer in a recital she shares with talented young artists. (Watch for the mezzo Isabel Leonard.) Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Midgette)    NEWBERRY CONSORT (Sunday) This fine ensemble of medieval and Renaissance specialists has assembled a program for the Frick Collection of works from the time of Hans Memling, the 15th-century Flemish artist whose portraits are being exhibited there. 5 p.m., the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700; sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK COLLEGIUM (Tonight) This well-established period ensemble plays Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concertos Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6. Ingrid Matthews is guest director and violin soloist. 8 p.m., Church of St. Vincent Ferrer, Lexington Avenue at 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 717-9246; $30 to $50. (Eichler)    MIAH PERSSON (Tonight) The young Swedish soprano recently had her debut in Salzburg, Austria, and at the Vienna State Opera; tonight she comes to Weill Hall with a pretty and fairly conventional program extending from Mozart, Schumann and Strauss to Grieg and two songs by the Swedish composer Gosta Nystroem. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32.(Midgette)    PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Christoph Eschenbach, the orchestra's music director, has on occasion conducted Dvorak symphonies as if they were by Mahler. Here he offers an actual Mahler symphony: one of the noisiest, the portentous Sixth. So perhaps the shoe will fit. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $99. (Oestreich)    'THE RINGS: MYTH AND MUSIC' (Sunday) Wagner meets the movies in the Collegiate Chorale's excerpts from ''The Ring'' and ''The Flying Dutchman'' played next to parts of Howard Shore's '' 'Lord of the Rings' Symphony.'' 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $85. (Holland)    'SHELTER' (Wednesday and Thursday) A collaborative work by the founders of Bang on a Can -- Julia Wolfe, Michael Gordon and David Lang -- this new score looks at forms of shelter, as well as the things we take shelter from. First performed in Cologne, Germany, in March, the work includes a libretto by Deborah Artman, film by Bill Morrison and projections by Laurie Olander, and will be performed by MusicFabrik and the Trio Mediaeval. 7:30 p.m., Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $45.

(Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck).    * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic Art into a final flowering . Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits and drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    SMITHSONIAN'S COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through May 7. A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8300. (Johnson)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    Kim Simonsson Under the influence of Japanese manga cartoons, this Finnish ceramicist makes large, monochromatic sculptures of wide-eyed, otherworldly girls and deer. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212) 242-3013, through Nov. 26. (Johnson)    Luc Tuymans: 'Proper' In Mr. Tuymans's most accessible show to date, dry, washed-out paintings based on seemingly random photographs add up to a jaundiced, rebuslike portrait of America. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, through Nov. 19. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'Eighth Annual International Juried Botanical Art Exhibition' The old-fashioned art of botanical illustration lives on, as evinced by this selection of finely made drawings and watercolors by more than 40 artists. Many are routinely competent, but some, like a small, intense picture of a gnarly root ball by Jean Emmons, are remarkable for both what and how they represent. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through Nov. 18. (Johnson)    * André KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)    'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)    Ray Mortenson: 'Cedars/Sea and Sky' Alternating between the land and sea of Rhode Island, this quietly gripping show of mostly small black-and-white photographs presents soft and misty images of bushy cedars and extraordinarily clear and luminous pictures of ocean waves. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, (212) 431-0166, through Dec. 4. (Johnson)    * 'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck)    'PLAIN OF HEAVEN' Organized by Creative Time, this show of mostly site-specific installations insinuates a reverberating, poetic Minimalism into the darkened spaces of a former meatpacking plant. The efforts of Corey McCorkle, O. Winston Link, Leandro Erlich, Helen Mirra, Gordon Matta-Clark, William Forsythe and Sakia Olde Wolbers are noteworthy. A sound piece by Trisha Donnelly will engulf the building for the last 20 minutes of the show's run. 832 Washington Street, at Gansevoort Street, West Village, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 20. (Smith)    * 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith).    'System in Chaos: New Art Brut From the Czech Republic' Four fascinating Czech outsiders: Zdenek Kosek's small, congested bubble diagrams chart unfathomable verbal associations; Lubos Plny's expansive, finely detailed drawings offer delirious lessons in human anatomy; Zbynek Semerak's small, delicately busy works on paper convey what seems a medieval iconography of religion and architecture; and Leos Wertheimer's large drawings portray locomotives with mechanical precision. Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, (212) 226-3768, through Nov. 26. (Johnson)    Robert Therrien, 'Table and Six Chairs' In a vast corporate atrium stand a table and six chairs that are wholly ordinary looking except for their gigantic size -- the chair backs rise to almost nine feet, and the top of the table is over six feet. Mr. Therrien transformed his own kitchen furniture into painted metal monuments that make the viewer feel like the protagonist of ''Jack and the Beanstalk.'' The Atrium of 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575, through Nov. 28. (Johnson)    Last Chance    TIM BAVINGTON Modes of the 1960's, like spray-painted stripes and geometrically shaped canvases, are revived in attractive, multipaneled abstractions, but with a contemporary conceptual twist. Mr. Bavington bases his compositional decisions on an obscure system by which he translates passages of old rock music from the aural to the visual. Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1701, closing tomorrow(Johnson)    BARKELY HENDRICKS: 'BEAUTIFUL LIKE A WOMAN, A REAL WOMAN' An exhibition tracing the artist's transition from still-life paintings to found-object assemblages gets a little too hung up on the female anatomy. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    EVA & ADELE These husband-and-wife German artists have frequented the art world for nearly two decades, always in identical dresses, bald heads, make-up and heels. It turns out they also collaborate on capable if generic paintings 1980s period pieces with bright, layered images. Claire Oliver, 513 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5949, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    FRANKLIN EVANS: 'FREAKOUT' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-0156, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    Shirley Jaffe Born in New Jersey in 1923 and a resident of Paris since 1949, Ms. Jaffe is still making lively, brightly colored abstract paintings that recall the jazzy Cubism of Stuart Davis. Her combination of formal rigor, playful sensuousness and allusions to pastoral landscapes will gladden your day. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue at 56th Street, (212) 262-5050, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    SERGEJ JENSEN The stylishly reticent, cerebral paintings in this young, Berlin-based Dane's memorably beautiful solo debut involve humble materials, homey techniques and a surprising amount of formalist backbone. Anton Kern Gallery, 523 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-9663, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    * Jasper Johns: 'Flag Drawings' This small, well-selected show of works on paper from private collections -- including Robert Rauschenberg's -- focuses on Mr. Johns's signature motif, the United States flag. Stars and Stripes dating from 1955 to 2000 are finely outlined, densely hatched and sensuously painted. A tiny example from 1957 is made in oil on a birth announcement with the white satin ribbon still attached. Craig F. Starr, 5 East 73rd Street, (212) 570-1739, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    'AARON JOHNSON: FIEND CLUB LOUNGE' The semi-abstract intestinal forms of this artist's previous paintings have mutated into full-fledged, rainbow-colored ghouls that teem with decorative malevolence. Priska C. Juschka Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-4320, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    'ALEX KATZ: FIRST SIGHT, WORKING DRAWINGS FROM 1965 TO 2002' Over 400 notebook drawings show the starting points of Mr. Katz's portraits, landscapes and still lifes, conveying a ceaseless, omnivorous attention to the world. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo (212) 343-0441, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    ROY LICHTENSTEIN: 'CONVERSATIONS WITH SURREALISM' In its swank, newly opened downtown outpost, a blue-chip uptown gallery is showing eight examples of this famous Pop artist's indelibly cartoonized, also swank borrowings from Surrealism. Mitchell Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, closing tomorrow (Smith)    DONALD MOFFETT A deliberately antiseptic installation of seemingly sharp-edged silver monochrome paintings conflates visual pleasure, monetary value and physical pain. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9889, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    Lynn Talbot, Daniel Zeller In small, lovingly made oil paintings, Ms. Talbot juxtaposes emblematic abstractions and Magic Realist still-lifes to sweetly mystical. Mr. Zeller continues to draw with maniacally exacting industry small and large abstractions resembling topographical maps by a cartographer from another, possibly microscopic, universe. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144, through Monday. (Johnson)    Zhou Xiaohu The best works in an unfocused presentation of efforts in various media by this versatile Chinese artist are the haunting, darkly comical Claymation videos depicting scenes like the trial of Saddam Hussein, a political assassination and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. Ethan Cohen, 18 Jay Street, near Hudson Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, closing tomorrow.

Over the past few years, a handful of leading country acts have come to town for promotional appearances, among them Sugarland, Lee Ann Womack and Miranda Lambert. And when Big & Rich needed a high-concept venue for a television special, they found one at the corner of Bleecker and Bowery: the elderly punk dive CBGB.

After a West End run, this Victorian thriller by Andrew Lloyd Webber comes to Broadway with the British musical theater star Michael Ball. Trevor Nunn (''Cats'') directs (3:00). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.    Broadway    'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clichés of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley).    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley).    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anne Midgette)    'CATHAY: THREE TALES OF CHINA' Joins puppetry, film and animation. The director-writer Ping Chong and the Shaanxi Folk Theater of China have created enchanting and moving theater (1:40). New Victory, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Neil Genzlinger)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'KARLA' The decks are stacked in Steve Earle's play about the death row inmate Karla Faye Tucker. It is strong on heartfelt narrative, but equally strong on preachy sentiment and wishfulness (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban)    'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Jefferson)    'MANIC FLIGHT REACTION' Sarah Schulman's intermittently zingy play is an awkward mixture of cultural satire and earnest psychodrama about love and responsibility. Deirdre O'Connell gives a warm, engaging performance as a reformed rebel with a colorful past that bleeds into the present in sensational ways (2:00). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'MEDEA'  The Jean Cocteau Repertory's cliché-ridden modern translation strains to be relevant (1:30). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, near East Second Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Jefferson)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SEE WHAT I WANNA TO SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsoke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SLUT'  This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn)    * 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prizewinning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley).    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'ASHLEY MONTANA GOES ASHORE IN THE CAICOS, OR: WHAT AM I DOING HERE?' A revue of satiric songs and sketches by Roger Rosenblatt that seeks to comment on the state of the national psyche. It's not good, apparently, but what's new? A bright cast keeps things lively, but Mr. Rosenblatt's targets are mostly moldy (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101 (Isherwood)    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'NORMAL' A misguided musical about a youngster's battle with anorexia and the stress it puts on her family. Gag (1:40). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)    'THE SALVAGE SHOP' Jim Nolan's moving, old fashioned drama, about a fraught father-and-son relationship in a small coastland town in Ireland, delivers an emotional punch (2:30). The Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30).

(Brantley)    * 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers that she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'EINSTEIN'S GIFT'  Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    'INDIA AWAITING' The charismatic Maulik Pancholy is an Indian-born Wall Street trader torn between his love for an American woman and his lingering ties to home (2:00). Samuel Beckett Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Horn)    'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231, closing Sunday. (Jefferson)    'WAR IN PARAMUS'  It is supposedly 1970 in Barbara Dana's new family drama, but you'd hardly know it from the generic troubles on display: two clueless parents, two polar-opposite daughters, two crises that could be from any time between the 1950's and today; only obligatory references to the war and the strife of the period (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger).    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AFTER INNOCENCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) Calm, deliberate and devastating, Jessica Sanders's documentary ''After Innocence'' examines the cases of seven men wrongly convicted of murder and rape and exonerated years later by DNA evidence. It confirms many of your worst fears about the weaknesses of the American criminal justice system. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BALLETS RUSSES' (No rating, 118 minutes) This documentary, combining the reminiscences of retired dancers with archival clips of their work, tells the story of two rival companies that shaped ballet in the mid-20th century. It is lively and moving enough to appeal even to nonballetomanes. (A. O. Scott)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott)    * 'DOMINO' (R, 113 minutes) A lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills from Tony Scott about the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey. (Manohla Dargis)    'DOOM' (R, 95 minutes) In this formulaic, claustrophobic shoot-'em-up, based on a video game, soldiers quell a mutant uprising on Mars. Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as the Rock, is the trigger-happy troop leader, while Rosamund Pike is the forensic archaeologist, who, like the audience, is trapped in a loud, hellish enclosure. (Ned Martel)    'DREAMER: INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY' (PG, 105 minutes) Pure, schmaltzy formula -- an injured racehorse, a down-on-his-luck trainer, his angelically cute daughter -- but just try to resist it.(Scott)    'ELIZABETHTOWN' (PG-13, 121 minutes) A well-intentioned mess from Cameron Crowe, in which a young man (the weightless Orlando Bloom) loses his job and his father and finds true love (the hard-working Kirsten Dunst) -- all in the course of a very short week and a very long two hours. (Scott)    'THE FOG' (PG-13, 100 minutes) This occasionally scary remake is about a dense, mysterious fog that hides vengeful spirits with a century-old grudge against an Oregon seaside town. At least there's a good-looking young cast, led by Tom Welling of ''Smallville'' and Maggie Grace of ''Lost.'' (Anita Gates)    'G' (R, 97 minutes) The decadent world of Hamptonite hip-hop moguls is the backdrop for this somewhat faithful but not very graceful retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.'' Soapy but well acted. (Laura Kern)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    * 'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)    * 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy, best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests. (Dargis)    'INNOCENT VOICES' (R, 120 minutes, in Spanish) Alternately powerful and mawkish, ''Innocent Voices'' remembers the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980's through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy from a rural village who faces forcible conscription into the army. (Holden)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of L.A. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)    'THE LEGEND OF ZORRO' (PG, 126 minutes) Like most sequels, this successor to ''The Mask of Zorro'' feels obliged to outperform its forerunner by being bigger, faster and more spectacular. That translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic. (Holden)    'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Gates)    'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)    'NEW YORK DOLL' (PG-13, 75 minutes) Greg Whiteley's small, tender documentary portrait looks at life after rock and roll as experienced by Arthur ''Killer'' Kane, the original bassist for the legendary glam-punk band the New York Dolls, who, at 55, enjoys a reunion that becomes a sweet last hurrah. (Holden)    * 'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)    'NORTH COUNTRY' (R, 123 minutes) A wobbly fiction about a real pioneering sex-discrimination case, ''North Country'' is an unabashed vehicle for its modestly de-glammed star, Charlize Theron, but it's also a star vehicle with heart -- an old-fashioned liberal weepie about truth and justice. (Dargis)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    'PRIME' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Actually, pretty mediocre. A thin romantic comedy that nonetheless has its charms, most of them provided by Uma Thurman as a divorced 37-year-old who falls for a 23-year old who happens to be her therapist's son. (Scott)    * 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)    'THE PROTOCOLS OF ZION' (No rating, 93 minutes) Marc Levin's ''Protocols of Zion,'' a documentary about a century-old forgery purporting to reveal a Jewish master plan to rule the world, makes its case expertly and powerfully. The film even has laughs (which is no small feat), but the cumulative effect of its message is enormous sadness that hate is so strong and so resistant to reason.(Gates)    'SAW II' (R, 91 minutes) Jigsaw, the sicko known for masterminding twisted life-or-death games, returns for a sequel that doesn't really compare to its fine predecessor, though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself. (Kern)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'STAY' (R, 98 minutes) The director Marc Forster, whose previous films include ''Finding Neverland,'' takes a maximalist approach to this mysterioso story about a psychiatrist and a suicidal patient dislocated by time, space and lots of crazily raked angles. (Dargis)    'THREE  EXTREMES' (R, 125 minutes, in Japanese, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese) This trilogy provides a sampler of short horror films from high-profile Asian directors: China's Fruit Chan, South Korea's Park Chan-Wook, and Japan's Takashi Miike. ''Three  Extremes'' may seem tame to jaded fans of what's been termed ''New Asian Horror,'' but it serves as a fine introduction to the genre for those who are curious but squeamish. (Dana Stevens)    'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)    'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden)    'EL VACILÓN: THE MOVIE' (R, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Luis Jimenez and Moonshadow, hosts of the wildly popular morning show on La Mega radio (WSKQ-FM), play themselves making a movie about their lives and their listeners' sexual adventures. The result is 90 minutes of over-the-top gross-out humor. (Gates)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)    'THE WEATHER MAN' (R, 102 minutes) No one relishes having his cake and eating it, too, more than Hollywood filmmakers. The latest case in point is a fainthearted bid at social satire called ''The Weather Man,'' about a middle-aged man (played by a hard-working Nicolas Cage) gazing into the yawning void of his life. (Dargis)    Film Series    CHILDREN IN THE 20TH CENTURY (Through Nov. 22) Symphony Space Thalia Film's international program of films focusing on problems that affect children continues with two dramas. ''La Promesse'' (1997), a French-Belgian production about a teenage boy at odds with his father, was named best foreign film by the National Society of Film Critics. ''The Bicycle Thief'' (1948) is the Vittorio De Sica classic about a poor father and his son searching for a stolen bicycle, without which the father will lose his job. Both films will be shown on Sunday and Tuesday. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10.

It begins on Thursday with ''A Woman Under the Influence'' (1974), the raw John Cassavetes drama about a descent into insanity. The screening will be followed by a question-and-answer session with Ms. Rowlands. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    A MOVING CAMERA: KENJI MIZOGUCHI (Through Nov. 22) BAMcinématek is screening seven films by Mizoguchi (1898-1956), renowned for his painterly filmmaking and his brilliant direction of women. Monday's feature is ''Osaka Elegy'' (1936), a strong drama about a young telephone operator who has an affair with her boss. Other films in the series will include ''The Life of Oharu'' (1952), the reflections of a middle-aged prostitute, and ''Sansho the Bailiff'' (1954), about an 11th-century nobleman and his family.

(Gates)    NARUSE: THE UNKNOWN JAPANESE MASTER (Through Nov. 17) Film Forum's four-week retrospective of the films of the Japanese director Mikio Naruse continues this weekend with three films. ''Late Chrysanthemums'' (1954) is the critically praised story of a wheeler-dealer geisha who hears from a former lover. ''Ginza Cosmetics'' (1951) is about a single mother whose job as a bar hostess leaves her no time for her child. ''A Wanderer's Notebook'' (1962) is inspired by the day-to-day travails of the novelist Fumiko Hayashi. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)    REEL JEWS FILM FESTIVAL (Through Nov. 12) Makor, a program of the 92nd Street Y, is sponsoring its sixth annual program of the works of emerging Jewish filmmakers. The series begins on Monday with ''Bernie'' (2005), Jay Heyman's documentary about his grandfather, a social worker; and ''Belle'' (2004), a documentary short about age and beauty. Next week's films include ''Christ in the City'' (2004), Yitz Brilliant's satirical 25-minute response to Mel Gibson's ''Passion of the Christ''; and ''B Movie'' (2004), Philip Dolin's re-creation of a low-budget, 1950's-style film, complete with a cave man, a lost world and starlets. 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000; $9. (Gates)    SOME LIKE IT WILDER: THE COMPLETE BILLY WILDER (Through Nov. 13) The Museum of the Moving Image is sponsoring a 26-film retrospective of Wilder, the Austrian-born director-writer who gave the world ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''Double Indemnity.'' This weekend's features are ''The Spirit of St. Louis'' (1957), with James Stewart as the superstar aviator Charles Lindbergh; ''The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes'' (1970), a look at the fictional detective's dark side; and ''Witness for the Prosecution'' (1957), a courtroom drama with Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and one of the greatest last-minute plot twists in movie history. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.

AEROSMITH, LENNY KRAVITZ (Tuesday and Thursday) The classic rock band Aerosmith has extended its career by being open to new styles. In the 1980's, the band collaborated with rap's Run DMC and, in the 90's, with the schmaltzy but effective ballad-smith Dianne Warren. Lenny Kravits does the opposite, pursuing the aesthetic and lifestyle of a late-60's guitar hero. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $38 to $128. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $35 to $125. (Laura Sinagra)    TREY ANASTASIO (Tuesday) This leader of the now defunct jam band Phish has spent recent down time joining protégées onstage and recording a stripped-down guitar album, ditching the studio filigree of his previous solo outing. 6:15 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $38. (Sinagra)    ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) This London art-rock quartet satirizes the safe rock milieu with its petulant stomp ''Formed a Band.'' With a talk-sing delivery more empathetic than that of Johnny Rotten but testier than that of Fred Schneider of the B-52's, Eddie Argos captures both the excitement and absurdity of pop. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. Thursday at 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12.

(Sinagra)    BROADCAST (Thursday) This pop group buries its melodies in static and hum, with the chilly voice of Trish Keenan providing the compelling thread through a jumble of half-recalled movie themes and sometimes ominous disarray. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    BROOKS & DUNN (Thursday) This long-running country duo tries to get its hillbilly on with a new batch of songs, including the vaguely rap-phobic ''Play Something Country.'' 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $37.50 in advance, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)    CALLA (Tomorrow) Burrowing into the dark corners of New Wave's shiny, happy side, the band Calla finds something more than brooding and vintage black couture. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13. (Sinagra)    CONSTANTINES, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Sunday) The Constantines' Bry Webb's baritone may rumble like that of other popular post-punk revivalists, but his acute sense of drone and sting sets the band's darkly pulsing indie rock apart. The Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls the Embarassment. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14. (Sinagra)    VLADISLAV DELAY (A K A LUOMO) (Tomorrow and Monday) This Finnish producer records and performs under various pseudonyms with different stylistic identities. Tomorrow, when he plays as the groovy Luomo, expect extended, meticulously building micro-house beats. As Delay on Monday, you imagine that he will become glitchier and more ominously atmospheric. Tomorrow at 10 p.m. and Monday at 11 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $14 tomorrow, $10 Monday. (Sinagra)    DIOS MALOS (Tonight) This laid-back quintet from Hawthorne, Calif., plays shaggy indie-rock marked by questing vocals, dream-pop harmonies and a kind of acoustic-electronic psychedelia that conjures a sofa daydream rather than a desert drive. 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    BEN FOLDS (Monday) Moving still further from the smarm of earlier incarnations, the gen-x piano man Ben Folds, who combines Billy Joel melodics with an ironic remove, lately reflects more somberly on fatherhood, blue-state regrets and the loss of idols like Elliot Smith. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $30 to $45. (Sinagra)    AL GREEN (Tonight) Soul oldies meet gospel testifying in Al Green's highly unpredictable performances. He sings, he preaches, he dances, he tosses roses to the ladies. He jumps in and out of songs and teases the crowd with his timing and his whims. Sometimes he makes songs like ''Let's Stay Together'' sound like aching, immediate pleas; sometimes the audience ends up singing more than he does. 6, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $175 first come, first seated; $100 standing room only. (Jon Pareles)    THE HOLD STEADY, BLOOD ON THE WALL (Monday) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady savant Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. Blood on the Wall, the Brooklyn trio fronted by the guitarist and vocalist Brad Shanks and his sister, the bassist and vocalist Courtney Shanks, make hip-shaking rock with a touch of Midwestern-gothic twang. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $17. (Sinagra)    JEM (Monday) The British sprite Jem writes and sings upbeat trip-pop that is informed by cheeky hip-hop. Her music is less schmaltzy or dire than similar fare by Dido or Beth Orton. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)    LA GUITARA: KAKI KING, PATTY LARKIN, MIMI FOX AND MURIEL ANDERSON (Sunday) The songwriter and guitarist Patty Larkin organized this showcase tour of female guitarists, including herself, the sassy Kaki King, the jazzy Mimi Fox and the fingerstyle player Muriel Anderson. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $30. (Sinagra)    CYNDI LAUPER (Tuesday) The New Waver Cyndi Lauper has become a visible social activist, while retaining the zany streak that made her jumpy pro-girl pop songs and emotional synthesizer ballads favorites on MTV in the 80's. 8 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $40. (Sinagra)    LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES, ANTIBALAS (Tonight) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 1970's Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rapping, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. The music insists on keeping the dance floor busy. Antibalas gets its funk by way of Nigeria, where Fela Kuti concocted Afrobeat to meld politics and propulsion; it's a large band that has made Fela's burly grooves its own. 11 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $22. (Pareles)    MAHRAJAN AL-FAN FESTIVAL OF ARAB ARTS (Tonight through Sunday) The Mahrajan Al-Fan Festival of Arab Arts begins with a performance by the Syrian poet Adonis.

(Sinagra)    RICKY MARTIN, JON SECADA, FRANKIE J (Tuesday) For the last few years, Ricky Martin has courted the Latin American audience with Spanish-language pop. This year his Latin confections are in English again, though his attempts to scuff them up with reggaeton beats and guest rappers are transparent. The Latin pop balladeer Jon Secada and the Tijuana-born R & B singer Frankie J also play. 7 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $77 to $97. (Sinagra)    DEL MCCOURY BAND WITH ABIGAIL WASHBURN (Thursday) The bluegrass banjo master Del McCoury upholds high lonesome traditions while still entertaining new directions, most notably his band's work backing the edgier Steve Earle in 1999.

(Sinagra)    SIMPLE PLAN (Tuesday and Wednesday) This band has done right by its name.

(Both shows sold out.) (Sinagra)    SPOON, AMERICAN MUSIC CLUB, MARY TIMONY (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Austin indie standout Brit Daniels's latest album is a tougher nut to crack than 2002's nearly flawless jitter-rock ''Kill the Moonlight'' (Merge). Live, his tight group, Spoon, swings from slacker angst to caffeinated bravado. The American Music Club's Mark Eitzel continues his conspiratorial wallowing and baritone complaints. The whimsical indie-rocker Mary Timony also plays. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $23.50.

(Allan Kozinn)    'COSÌ FAN TUTTE'  (Tonight) This is the ultimate ensemble opera and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production is an impressive ensemble effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast.

James Levine conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $205. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Monday and Thursday) The admirable American soprano Elizabeth Futral gives a vibrant, incisive and vocally top-notch performance in the touchstone title role of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor.'' Still, on opening night she was so concerned with singing this daunting role honestly that she seemed reluctant to plumb the emotional recesses of this unstable and fascinating character. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini)    * 'THE MINES OF SULPHUR' (Tomorrow) Contemporary opera has always been New York City Opera's soul, if not necessarily its bread and butter. Its latest adventure is this gripping horror tale with an emotionally searing 12-tone score by Sir Richard Rodney Bennett and a taut libretto by Beverley Cross, all set in a suitably dark staging. The superb cast includes Jessie Raven, Mark Duffin, Caroline Worra and Timothy Nolen in the major roles. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Kozinn)    'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The venerable Amato Opera may seat scarcely more than 100, but it can't be accused of cowardice.

(Anne Midgette)    'TURANDOT'  (Tonight, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) If your idea of a stimulating evening is watching a beefy and clearly none too intelligent prince devoting himself to winning the heart of a creepy harridan -- and, O.K., singing ''Nessun Dorma'' along the way -- the company's venerable Beni Montresor staging (now directed by Beth Greenberg) is back on the boards, with a strong cast that includes Lori Phillips in the title role, Philip Webb as Calaf and Guylaine Girard as Liù.

(Kozinn)    CAMERATA IRELAND (Wednesday) Here's an unusual expression of musical nationalism: the musicians in this ensemble are all Irish, but some of them live and usually work outside Ireland. The program itself is international, with works by Penderecki and Beethoven (including the Fourth Piano Concerto, with Barry Douglas as the soloist), as well as a contemporary Irish work, John Kinsella's Nocturne for Strings. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $50. (Kozinn)    'A CENTURY OF NORWEGIAN INDEPENDENCE' (Sunday) Norway celebrates itself with a program of little-known music, from a violin concerto by the country's composer Arne Nordheim, to the American premiere of a piece Johan Halvorsen wrote in 1910 to honor Theodore Roosevelt, incorporating the American national anthem and ''Yankee Doodle.'' Per Brevig conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. 7 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15 to $65. (Midgette)    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Wednesday) The Chamber Music Society's youth movement is in action with the Borromeo String Quartet and the pianist Jonathan Biss playing the Stravinsky Concertino, Schoenberg's First String Quartet and the beloved Schumann Piano Quintet. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Holland)    CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) In his final season as music director in Chicago, Daniel Barenboim offers a little of everything, from a piece Elliott Carter wrote for him and the orchestra, ''Soundings,'' to Mahler's Fifth. If you miss the concert in New York, the symphony is offering a reprise in New Jersey (Schoenberg and Schubert). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $120. Sunday afternoon at 2, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $27 to $92. (Midgette)    DENNIS RUSSELL DAVIES AND MAKI NAMEKAWA (Wednesday) Mr. Davies is most often heard as a conductor, but here he partners with another pianist for an enticing evening of chamber music. The program lists works by Philip Glass and Shoko Shida, but the highlight may be Messiaen's sprawling mystical treatise for two pianos, ''Visions de l'Amen.'' 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $25. (Jeremy Eichler)    GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri trudges on into another season as the de facto quartet-in-residence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Each of its six concerts will feature a Mozart quartet, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Oboe Quartet (with Joseph Robinson) as well as Debussy's Quartet and Brahms's Quartet No. 3. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler)    LEILA JOSEFOWICZ (Thursday) With John Novacek at the piano, this violinist offers a program lying largely in the 20th century: Messiaen, Salonen, Mark Grey and Ravel. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 and $35. (Holland)    McDUFFIE-DUTTON-KIRSHBAUM TRIO (Tomorrow) Three star string players play three major string trios. Lawrence Dutton, who is also the violist of the Emerson String Quartet; Robert McDuffie, a violinist, and the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, currently touring together, come to New York, with Dohnanyi's Serenade in C and trios by Beethoven and Mozart. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $30. (Midgette)    MUSIC BEFORE 1800 (Sunday) Galatea, a European early-music ensemble founded by the lute player Paul Beier, makes its New York debut with works by Marini, Buonamente, Rognoni and Terzi. 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266; $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+ . (Eichler)    MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) The touring arm of this venerable festival arrives in New York with a program of Beethoven (String Trio, Op. 9, No. 2), Berg (''Lyric Suite'') and Dvorak (String Sextet). One hopes that they also bring along the festival's relaxed and spontaneous spirit of music-making. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Eichler)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) The Finnish conductor Mikko Franck pays a visit to the New York Philharmonic, bringing with him music by Schnittke, Shostakovich and Beethoven, not to mention the violinist Gidon Kremer. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76 this afternoon, $26 to $94 tomorrow. (Holland)    GIACINTO SCELSI: 100th BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight) The Italian modernist composer Giacinto Scelsi, who died in 1988, would surely be amazed to see the attention that has come to his work in recent years. A mysterious figure who suffered a debilitating mental breakdown in midcareer, he was essentially unknown outside contemporary music circles in Italy during his lifetime. Celebrating his centenary, the adventurous Flux Quartet will play all five of Scelsi's string quartets. 8, Miller Theater, Broadway and 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20. (Tommasini)    DEBORAH VOIGT AND BEN HEPPNER (Wednesday) Wagner fans in New York have long had this date circled on their calendars, when the soprano Deborah Voigt and the tenor Ben Heppner, two of the leading Wagnerian voices of our day, will present a joint concert with the Orchestra of St. Luke's, Asher Fisch conducting. There will be arias from Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and Weber's ''Freischütz,'' but Wagner dominates, and there is much to savor. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Tommasini)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Through Sunday) The company's lamentably short three-week City Center season ends Sunday afternoon.

The books, with one scene from each portrayed as a duet, are ''Anna Karenina,'' ''The Fountainhead,'' ''East of Eden'' and ''Franny and Zooey.'' The audience will be split into small groups and guided to sites within a 19th-century church. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 7 p.m., First Unitarian Church of Brooklyn, 121 Pierrepont Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 832-0018 or www.bax.org; $15; students and 62+, $12.

(Rockwell)    JANE GOLDBERG: 'BELLY TAP FOR WORLD PEACE' (Tonight through Sunday nights) Variously known as ''the tap goddess of the Lower East Side'' and the originator of the ''tap and schmooze'' format, Ms. Goldberg is also a performer who embodies a great deal of tap history. 8, Blue Mountain Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 393-1182; suggested donation: $15 to $25. (Dunning)    YASS HAKOSHIMA MOVEMENT THEATER (Tuesday) Yass Hakoshima joins forces with the Da Capo Chamber Players and the ceramic artist Toshiko Takaezu to present an evening of theatrical mime. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or www.symphonyspace.org; $25; students and 65+, $15.

(Dunning)    * LAR LUBOVITCH DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday and Thursday) Now in his 37th season, Mr. Lubovitch will present the United States premiere of ''Elemental Brubeck,'' set to music by Dave Brubeck. He is also working with a company of 14 dancers that includes many of the most gifted, seasoned performers in New York dance today. 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200; $35 and $45; students, $12. (Dunning)    NICKI MARSHALL AND HELEN STYRING TOCCI: 'ON A DAY WHICH IS EVERYDAY' (Tonight and tomorrow night) This eveninglong piece tells a story of awakening. 8, WOW Cafe Theater, 59-61 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 777-4280 or www.wowcafe.org.; $15; artists and students, $12.

(Dunning)    SYREN MODERN DANCE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Accessibility is what drives this troupe, this time in choreography by the company directors Kate Mehan and Lynn Peterson, set to scores that include music composed or performed by Dvorak, Keith Jarrett, Moondog and Otis Redding. 8, Citigroup Theater at the Ailey Studios, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444 or www.syrendance.org; $15; students and 65+, $12.

(Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck).    * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic Art into a final flowering . Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.)(Michael Kimmelman)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck)    Galleries: Uptown    * Jasper Johns: 'Flag Drawings' This small, well-selected show of works on paper from private collections -- including Robert Rauschenberg's -- focuses on Mr. Johns's signature motif, the United States flag. Stars and Stripes dating from 1955 to 2000 are finely outlined, densely hatched and sensuously painted. A tiny example from 1957 is made in oil on a birth announcement with the white satin ribbon still attached. One from 2000 reproduces the famous stack of three flags in miniature. Craig F. Starr, 5 East 73rd Street, (212) 570-1739, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections' This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits and drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 20. (Johnson)    'Yinka Shonibare Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8300, through May 7. (Johnson)    'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    BARKELY HENDRICKS: 'BEAUTIFUL LIKE A WOMAN, A REAL WOMAN' An exhibition tracing the artist's transition from still-life paintings to found-object assemblages gets a little too hung up on the female anatomy. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242, through Nov. 12. (Smith)    Tim Bavington Modes of the 1960's, like spray-painted stripes and geometrically shaped canvases, are revived in attractive, multipaneled abstractions, but with a contemporary conceptual twist. Mr. Bavington bases his compositional decisions on an obscure system by which he translates passages of old rock music from the aural to the visual. Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    Stephen Bush, 'Penetrol' This Australian painter presents partly abstract pictures of rustic cabins in alpine settings. Made in thick, viscous, partly brushed and partly poured enamel and oil paints in hallucinatory hues of hot pink, red and green, they suggest a kind of sentimental romance escalated into a gorgeous but frightening psychotic delusion. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    'Contemporary Obscurists' Works by contemporary artists who use the camera obscura in variously inventive ways include Vera Lutter's huge negative image of an abandoned factory interior; Shi Guorui's ghostly, panoramic view of Shanghai; and Abelardo Morell's magical photographs of bedrooms with upside-down views of the city projected onto their interior walls. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    Chris Doyle: 'Flight Power Love Tower' A startling, semi-abstract sculpture of a giant, illuminated flying eagle made of slender lengths of wood and long fluorescent lights fills the front exhibition space. One of the amusing stop-action videos in the back shows the artist flying through his studio. Jessica Murray, 150 Eleventh Avenue, near 22nd Street, (212) 633-9606, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    Franklin Evans: 'freakout' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    ROY LICHTENSTEIN: 'CONVERSATIONS WITH SURREALISM' In its swank, newly opened downtown outpost, a blue-chip uptown gallery is showing eight examples of this famous Pop artist's indelibly cartoonized, also swank borrowings from Surrealism. Mitchell Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, through Nov. 12. (Smith)    Kim Simonsson Under the influence of Japanese manga cartoons, this Finnish ceramicist makes large, monochromatic sculptures of wide-eyed, otherworldly girls and deer. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212) 242-3013, through Nov. 26. (Johnson)    Luc Tuymans: 'Proper' In Mr. Tuymans's most accessible show to date, dry, washed-out paintings based on seemingly random photographs add up to a jaundiced, rebuslike portrait of America. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, through Nov. 19. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'Eighth Annual International Juried Botanical Art Exhibition' The old-fashioned art of botanical illustration lives on, as evinced by this selection of finely made drawings and watercolors by more than 40 artists. Many are routinely competent, but some, like a small, intense picture of a gnarly root ball by Jean Emmons, are remarkable for both what and how they represent. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through Nov. 18. (Johnson)    * André KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)    'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)    * 'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck)    * 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith).    Lynn Talbot, Daniel Zeller In small, lovingly made oil paintings, Ms. Talbot juxtaposes emblematic abstractions and Magic Realist still-lifes to sweetly mystical and seductively sensuous effect. Mr. Zeller continues to draw with maniacally exacting industry small and large abstractions resembling topographical maps by a cartographer from another, possibly microscopic, universe. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144, through Nov. 14. (Johnson)    Robert Therrien, 'Table and Six Chairs' In a vast corporate atrium stand a table and six chairs that are wholly ordinary looking except for their gigantic size -- the chair backs rise to almost nine feet, and the top of the table is over six feet. The Los Angeles-based Mr. Therrien transformed his own kitchen furniture into painted metal monuments that make the viewer feel like the protagonist of ''Jack and the Beanstalk.'' The Artium of 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575, through Nov. 28. (Johnson)    Zhou Xiaohu The best works in an unfocused presentation of efforts in various media by this versatile Chinese artist are the haunting, darkly comical Claymation videos depicting scenes like the trial of Saddam Hussein, a political assassination and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.

(Johnson)    Last Chance    * 'BARKLEY HENDRICKS: 1972-1983' This uneven show is dominated by the artist's imposing full-length portraits and introduces a series of finely composed and sometimes hand-colored photographs that give a fuller account of the world distilled into his paintings.

(Smith)    'Harry Kramer' The spirit of Abstract Expressionism lives on in the work of an artist who has been exhibiting in New York regularly since 1970.
