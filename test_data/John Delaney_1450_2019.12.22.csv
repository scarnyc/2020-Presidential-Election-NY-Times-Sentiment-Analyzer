Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.         Previews and Openings    'ALL THIS INTIMACY' In previews; opens Thursday. A romantically ambitious poet balances relationships with three women in this new play by Rajiv Joseph. Presented by Second Stage Theater (1:45). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway; (212) 246-4422.    'AMAJUBA: LIKE DOVES WE RISE' In previews; opens Tuesday. Based on the lives of the five cast members, this play, which incorporates dance and song, is about growing up in apartheid-era South Africa (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 307-4100.    'INDIAN BLOOD' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Aug. 9. Primary Stages presents A. R. Gurney's new comedy about a rebellious American Indian boy coming of age in the 1940's. Mark Lamos directs (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200.    LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL Through July 30. This always-buzzed-about summer showcase includes ''DruidSynge,'' the complete works of John Millington Synge (see below), and ''Grendel,'' an opera directed by Julie Taymor. Sites in and around Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500.    MIDTOWN INTERNATIONAL THEATER FESTIVAL Through Aug. 6. The seventh annual showcase often gets lost in the shuffle, despite its large and diverse collection of shows. There should be more than 60 productions this season, at four locations on 36th Street. Schedules and information; (212) 868-4444.    Broadway     'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)    'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE HOUSE IN TOWN'  A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    * 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930's, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.(Neil Genzlinger)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Hunka)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)    Off Off Broadway    'CHEKHOV & MARIA'  Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching, beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, between Second and Third Avenues, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to music by Earth, Wind & Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'MANHATTAN MADCAPS of 1924' A not-very-madcap story is indeed included, but this is essentially a revue made of up of Rodgers and Hart songs, many of them fairly obscure. Better singing voices in the cast might help show them off to fuller advantage; as it is, the main attraction is a trio of songs with unfamiliar lyrics, but a very familiar tune: the one that, on the fourth try, became ''Blue Moon'' (1:20). Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' José Rivera, who wrote the screenplay for ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' penned this rickety piece of historical speculation about the final two days of Che Guevara's life (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday.(Jason Zinoman)    'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning, but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Stephen Holden)    * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    'EDMOND' (R, 76 minutes) William H. Macy gives what may be the performance of his career in the faithful screen adaptation of David Mamet's raw, epithet-spattered spiritual fable about a buttoned-up milquetoast who heeds his inner demons and plummets into free fall; hateful and unforgettable. (Holden)    * 'EXCELLENT CADAVERS' (No rating, 92 minutes, in English and Italian) Based on the book by Alexander Stille, this tough, brisk documentary follows Mr. Stille to Italy, where he reconstructs the recent history of the Italian mafia, focusing on the careers of two courageous prosecutors who took on organized crime and the political system that protected it. (Scott)    'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Nathan Lee)    'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES'  (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)    * 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeoisie Parisian marriage, circa 1912. (Dargis)    'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden)    * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-age white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)    'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis)    'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)    'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)    'MINI'S FIRST TIME' (R, 91 minutes) Yet another poor little rich girl tends to her festering inner wounds by becoming one of Southern California's children of the damned. Nikki Reed stars alongside the slumming likes of Alec Baldwin, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jeff Goldblum and Luke Wilson. (Dargis)    * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)    * 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    'PEACEFUL WARRIOR' (PG-13, 120 minutes) As ludicrous as the title promises yet supremely unembarrassed, this New Age enlightenment parable has its heart in the right place, but a mind of corny mush. (Lee)    'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST' Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)    'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    '71 FRAGMENTS OF A CHRONOLOGY OF CHANCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) This 1994 film from that great provocateur Michael Haneke follows a handful of seemingly unrelated characters, all of whom -- perhaps by chance, perhaps by divine intervention, though mostly through artistic contrivance -- have the grave misfortune to be in an Austrian bank when a student starts unloading his revolver. (Dargis)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)    'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)    * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    YOU, ME AND DUPREE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)    Film Series    GREAT VILLAINS IN CINEMA (Through July 30) BAMcinématek is honoring movie bad guys, from Dracula to Michael Corleone. This weekend's features include ''White Heat'' (1949), starring James Cagney as a psychotic killer with a mother fixation; and ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), with Malcolm McDowell as a hooligan with a taste for ultraviolence. BAM Rose Cinemas, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Anita Gates)    FRANK BORZAGE, HOLLYWOOD ROMANTIC (Through Aug. 20) A 24-film retrospective of Borzage (1893-1962), one of the first directors to win an Oscar (for ''Seventh Heaven''), continues at the Museum of the Moving Image.

(Gates)    HISTORIC HARLEM PARKS FESTIVAL: THROUGH AFRICAN EYES AND PRIZED PIECES (Through Aug. 3) This fifth annual outdoor festival continues Wednesday night with Zézé Gamboa's ''Hero'' (2004), about a homeless veteran of the civil war in Angola. Thursday night's feature is ''Beyond Beats and Rhymes'' (2006), Byron Hurt's study of sex roles in hip-hop and rap. Jackie Robinson Park, the basketball courts at 150th Street and Bradhurst Avenue, (212) 352-1720; free. (Gates)    KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues Sunday and Tuesday with ''The Bad Sleep Well'' (1960), which places the ''Hamlet'' story in postwar corporate Japan. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates)    PREMIERE BRAZIL! (Through Sunday) The Museum of Modern Art's fourth annual program of contemporary Brazilian film concludes this weekend with the screening of seven features.

Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    DICKEY BETTS AND GREAT SOUTHERN (Wednesday) Kicked out of the Allman Brothers, a band he founded, the guitarist Dickey Betts wasted no time in going back on tour with his own group. His chiming, symmetrical guitar solos and the weary but amiable voice from songs like ''Blue Skies'' are intact, and he may even have something to prove. With Kenny Wayne Shepherd. At 9:30 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $52. (Jon Pareles)    MARY J. BLIGE (Tonight) Mary J. Blige has long been emoting through hip-hop and soul for ''all my sisters, my troubled sisters.'' Her latest, ''The Breakthrough'' (Geffen), also finds her in a duet with U2. (She steals the show.) With Jaheim and LeToya. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $59.50 to $129.50. (Ben Sisario)    * BRAND NEW (Thursday) This Long Island emo band made a quantum leap with its second album three years ago, from whiny and unchallenging breakup songs to tangles of explosive melody with brooding, sometimes horrific lyrics. What the band will come up with on the as-yet-unscheduled album No. 3 is a subject of intense speculation among fans, who quickly snatched up all tickets for this tour. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)    JIM CAMPILONGO, JESSE HARRIS, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band the Little Willies; here he leads his Electric Trio. Jesse Harris, who wrote Ms. Jones's hit ''Don't Know Why,'' sings in the graceful and guileless manner of Paul Simon and James Taylor when on his own. Mike Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. At 9 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; no cover. (Sisario)    * CAT POWER (Tuesday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded with a group of veteran Memphis soul players, yielding some of the most stirring -- and happiest -- music of her career. Performing solo, she is spellbindingly intense and mercurial. At 8 p.m., Hiro Ballroom at the Maritime Hotel, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-4300; $20. (Sisario)    CHEB I SABBAH (Tomorrow) Indian devotional music meets the beat, now and then, in the music of DJ Cheb I Sabbah, who swirls together various styles into heady meditations. He is joined on vocals by the singer Riffat Salamat Sultana, daughter of the Pakistani singer Ustad Salamat Ali Khan. At 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Pareles)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden)    DON CABALLERO (Tonight) In the mid-1990's, Don Caballero, from Pittsburgh, was one of a handful of overachieving guitar bands whose knotty, laser-precise and deliberately undanceable instrumentals exemplified the fittingly named subgenre math-rock. The band broke up six years ago, but its drummer, Damon Che, has repopulated it with new players; its new album, ''World Class Listening Problem'' (Relapse), suggests that there was more to the old group's appeal than just math. With Blind Idiot God, Alger Hiss, Houston McCoy and the Victoria Lucas. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $13. (Sisario)    'DOT DASH YEAR IV' (Thursday) Each summer Dot Dash, a little concert promoter in Brooklyn devoted to punk and garage-rock, throws a festival with some big-deal reunions -- big deals in the small and passionate world of garage-rock, anyway. This year its three-day series begins on Thursday with the return of the Dicks, a Texas band from the early 1980's that sang ragged and churlish complaints with titles like ''Hate the Police.'' Also on the bill are the Marked Men, the Carbonas and Live Fast Die. The highlight of the festival will be an appearance by Rocket From the Tombs on July 29. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $17. (Sisario)    EARLY MAN, BAD WIZARD, 3 INCHES OF BLOOD (Tuesday) The best retro bands do not just conjure up an old artist or even a specific era, but freely toy with their influences to suggest a past that never quite existed. Three Inches of Blood updates the galloping, swords-and-goblins rock of early-1980's groups like Iron Maiden and Manowar with harsh streaks of violence that recall later death-metal. Early Man, on its debut album, ''Closing In'' (Matador), begins in the comforting mud of Black Sabbath and ends airborne, with a speed and control that comes down from Metallica. Also on the bill is Bad Wizard, whose plodding re-creations of Grand Funk Railroad and Kiss illustrate a less imaginative kind of retro-rock. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario)    MELISSA ETHERIDGE (Monday through Wednesday) Love takes on heroic dimensions in the songs of Melissa Etheridge. She puts her own mark on the brawny guitar riffs and raspy-voiced melodies of 1980's heartland rock, as adoring audiences sing along. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $104.50. (Pareles)    GOLDEN SMOG (Wednesday) Even heartsick alt-country has its celebrity supergroups. Golden Smog includes Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum, Gary Louris and Marc Perlman of the Jayhawks, and Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run. Opening the show is David Poe, a singer and guitarist, whose wit and sparkle come through largely between songs. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)    HOLD STEADY (Thursday) Like the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady -- from Brooklyn, though with Minneapolis origins -- plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I heard about original sin,'' he growls. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario)    JONATHAN KANE (Tomorrow) John Lee Hooker meets La Monte Young in the droning, bluesy incantations of Mr. Kane, a mainstay in the downtown avant-garde scene who has played drums with Swans, Rhys Chatham and Gary Lucas. He has a drummer's sense of steady dynamic development and an unapologetic love of noise. He plays two shows. At 2 p.m., with Dragons of Zynth, Home and Taiko Masala, East River Amphitheater, East River Park, south of Delancey Street, Lower East Side, ermp.org; free. At 9 p.m., with Golden Tongues, Mahi Mahi and Ambitious Orchestra, Sin-é, 150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077; $10. (Sisario)    * JASON LYTLE (Tomorrow and Monday) In Grandaddy, Mr. Lytle sang as if he were Neil Young trapped inside a computer chip: with a voice tiny and yet infinite, yearning to be fully human yet stuck within the strictures of the information age. Grandaddy recently released its final album, ''Just Like the Fambly Cat'' (V2), but it is an unsatisfying epitaph; fans will crowd these rare solo shows for hints of a new direction. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Monday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)    MALDITA VECINDAD, KONONO NO. 1, DAARA J (Sunday) What do a ska-flavored Mexican hard-rock band, a Congolese group that makes trance music from amplified thumb pianos and a Senegalese rap trio have in common? Not much except that they can all be lumped into the world-music category, however puzzlingly. Maldita Vecindad paints its ska rhythms with ominous, distorted metal. Konono No. 1 titled one album ''Congotronics,'' an apt term for its polyrhythmic bubblings of amplified likembés -- hand-held thumb pianos made from thin strips of medal. Daara J speed-raps in at least four languages: English, French, Spanish and Wolof. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. Maldita Vecindad also plays Sunday night at S.O.B.'s, and Konono No. 1 plays there on Monday. At 8 and 10:30, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $22 in advance, $25 at the door on Sunday; $25 in advance, $28 at the door on Monday. (Sisario)    THOMAS MAPFUMO AND THE BLACKS UNLIMITED (Tuesday) A musical pioneer with a rebel's courage, Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled government from what was Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe. The music transferred the brisk patterns of traditional thumb-piano music to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)    JOHN MAYALL AND THE BLUESBREAKERS (Tonight) In the 1960's John Mayall ran the premier finishing school for British blues-rock guitarists: at various times his band -- still called the Bluesbreakers despite 40-odd years of lineup changes -- included the young Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor (later of the Rolling Stones) and Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac), among others. At 8 and 10:30, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $30. (Sisario)    OAKLEY HALL (Tonight) Patient country-folk mutates into dense psychedelic drones in the songs of this Brooklyn band led by Pat Sullivan, a former member of Brooklyn's other masters of psychedelic minimalism, Oneida. With Mike Wexler, Black Taj and Endless Boogie. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sisario)    * OS MUTANTES (Tonight) The oddest, most exuberant and most wonderfully innovative band of the late-1960's tropicália movement in Brazil -- when there was no shortage of odd, exuberant and wonderfully innovative musicians -- was Os Mutantes (the Mutants), which filtered American and British psychedelic and garage-rock through bossa nova and a do-what-thou-wilt pop-art philosophy. The band broke up in 1978, and before this brief tour -- with some but not all of its original members -- had never performed in the United States. With Death Vessel. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $50. (Sisario)    PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES, JASON LYTLE (Sunday) In the weeks before the concert giant Live Nation begins to put on big-ticket concerts at the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (its first there is Bloc Party on July 29), a number of smaller, scrappier promoters have been using the space -- a 50,000-square-foot public pool closed since 1984 -- for free shows. Sunday afternoon features Pretty Girls Make Graves, a Seattle band with a knack for angular, heartfelt melodies that cut through clouds of noise; and Mr. Lytle, the lead singer of Grandaddy, who is in town this weekend for a few appearances (see above). With Bon Savants. At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, thepoolparties.com. (Sisario)    RASPUTINA (Tonight) Rasputina is a charmingly improbable project: part Marie Antoinette, part metal. Three women who are cellists in corsets (as well as a drummer) sing about Transylvanian concubines as their music seesaws between elaborate chamber-music counterpoint and grunting hard-rock chords, complete with distortion. At 9, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Pareles)    BUTCH WALKER AND THE LET'S GO OUT TONITES (Wednesday) Mr. Walker first revealed his fondness for muscular mid-1970's pop-rock and his mocking obsession with stardom as the leader of the Marvelous 3. Now on his own, he hasn't lost his ambition or his sense of irony. With Boys Like Girls and As Fast As. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Pareles)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Monday) This little big band, led by the irrepressible slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein, has a forthcoming album called ''MTO Volume 1'' (Sunnyside) that is full of signature touches, like effervescent swing arrangements and covers of hits by Prince and Stevie Wonder. Tonight at 7, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, at Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 620-5000, Ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $20.

(Nate Chinen)    MICHAEL BLAKE'S EULIPION ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Mr. Blake, a resourceful tenor and soprano saxophonist, leads a group inspired partly by the classic work of composer-arrangers like Gil Evans and Yusef Lateef. Its ranks include Marcus Rojas on tuba, Steven Bernstein on trumpet, Peck Almond on woodwinds and G. Calvin Weston on drums. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8. (Chinen)    DON BYRON QUARTET (Wednesday through July 30) Mr. Byron is justifiably known for his independent-minded concept albums -- his next one will shine a spotlight on the rhythm-and-blues saxophonist Junior Walker -- but he is, first and foremost, a daring clarinetist. He plays here with several longtime associates: the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, the bassist Lonnie Plaxico and the drummer Billy Hart. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25, $30 on July 28 and 29.

(Chinen)    * CELEBRATION OF RAY BARRETTO & HILTON RUIZ (Tuesday through July 30) ''Standards Rican-ditioned,'' recently issued on Zoho Music, was the final studio album of the conga virtuoso Ray Barretto. It also turned out to be the last recorded effort by the pianist Hilton Ruiz. Both were New York-born musicians of Puerto Rican heritage and were pillars of Latin jazz. This tribute, fittingly programmed as the culmination of Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola's monthlong Latin in Manhattan Festival, includes Mr. Barretto's son Chris Barretto, as well as a two more-established saxophonists, Sonny Fortune and David Sánchez. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 p.m. set July 28 and 29, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

(Chinen)    KARL DENSON TRIO (Monday) Funk and soul are at the heart of Mr. Denson's music, whether he's leading his signature band, Tiny Universe, or spotlighting his alto saxophone in this smaller unit, with Anthony Smith on keyboards and Brett Sanders on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    ORRIN EVANS QUINTET (Tomorrow) Mr. Evans is a percussive pianist equally attuned to hard bop and hip-hop, and he often surrounds himself with rhythmically assertive sidemen. Here that company includes the saxophonists Abraham Burton and J. D. Allen, the bassist Luques Curtins and the drummer Donald Edwards. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15.

Here they perform as a collective, though the order of billing seems intentional: Mr. Formanek will also lead a preconcert instrumental workshop from 4 to 6 p.m. The concert begins at 8 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, near Third Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, www.schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12, with a separate $25 charge for the afternoon workshop.

(Chinen)    FRED HERSCH TRIO (Wednesday) Mr. Hersch, a pianist strongly associated with solo recitals, leads a trio for this outdoor performance, and not with his usual partners. But the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Eric McPherson should make an excellent rhythm section, and each has experience with Mr. Hersch's literate and cosmopolitan style. At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street, (212) 538-6667, www.madisonsquarepark.org; free.

It's no accident that his quintet includes a member of Fellowship, the pianist and composer Jon Cowherd, along with the alto-saxophonist Will Vinson, the bassist Matt Penman and the drummer Rodney Green. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15.

(Chinen)    TIERNEY SUTTON (Wednesday through July 29) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer, as she proved on her fine recent album, ''I'm With the Band'' (Telarc), which was recorded at Birdland. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

(Tommasini)     * 'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Monday and Thursday) Humperdinck's orchestration for his opera ''Hansel and Gretel'' is rich and Wagnerian. But in some performances it can overwhelm this lyrical fairy tale. Kathleen Kelly, the music director of the Berkshire Opera, has prepared a chamber orchestra arrangement for that company's new fully staged production of the opera, to be performed in a new English translation by Cori Ellison at the intimate and magnificently restored theater of the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center in Great Barrington, Mass.

Thursday benefit tickets begin at $50.(Roslyn Sulcas)    HEIDI DUCKLER COLLAGE DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Duckler is known as Los Angeles's ''queen of site-specific performance,'' the press release says. This production of ''Laundromatinee,'' part of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's Sitelines performances, may well show she deserves claim to the title. It involves dancers spinning in dryers and hanging from clotheslines, then -- this sounds like the best bit -- removing their clothes to sing ''Stand By Your Man.'' 8.30 p.m., Laundromat, 168 Elizabeth Street, between Spring and Kenmare Streets; (212) 219-9401, www.lmcc.net/sitelines; free.

(Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)    DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)    * FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ÉTIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * MET: 'TREASURES OF SACRED MAYA KINGS,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)    * MORGAN LIBRARY AND MUSEUM: 'MASTERWORKS FROM THE MORGAN,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE WORD ON THE STREET: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF LARRY RACIOPPO,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN : CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDENS, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in formal reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700. (Johnson)    * NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)    * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART : 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)    * SARAH SZE: 'CORNER PLOT' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    * HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.'  This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith)    * RUDY BURCKHARDT: 'NEW YORK PAINTINGS' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)    GEORGE HERMS Starting out as a beatnik in the 1950's, Mr. Herms has been creating and exhibiting his richly poetic assemblages of grungy found materials in California, his home state, for more than a half century. This show's eight works, from 1965 to 2002, variously call to mind Ernst, Duchamp, Cornell and Rauschenberg, but they have as well their own spiritually generous, heartfelt mix of hermetic imagination and Whitman-esque populism. Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, through July 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    * 'A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL BEING WRITES POETRY ON A FIELD WITH SCULPTURES' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West Second Street, (212) 243-0200, through Aug. 11. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    JOE BIEL With an exacting illustrator's touch, Mr. Biel draws large, dreamily perverse images of children, like the one of a girl with rabbit ears and a whip peeking out of a cardboard box and the knife-wielding boy crouching atop a pile of rubble and examining a bone he found. Goff + Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Aug. 12. (Johnson)    * CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. CRG Gallery, 535 East 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, through July 28. (Smith)    'Material Abuse' Unconventional uses of nontraditional materials include Shinique Smith's massive bale of all-white clothing; Michael Arcega's fleet of 300 tiny, balsa-wood tanks; Richard Klein's assemblage made from 10 years' worth of blown-out light-bulb filaments; Jean Shin's stacks of prescription pill bottles; Ray Beldner's dust-covered assemblages made of ordinary objects stolen from other people; and a star-and-stripe-patterned bikini made of map tacks by Devorah Sperber. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-8304, through Aug. 4. (Johnson)    'Money Changes Everything' A show of artworks made at least partly out of actual money: dollar bills, mostly, but Iraqi dinar notes, too. Schroeder Romero, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 630-0722, through July 28. (Johnson)    'Photography Is Not An Art!' More than 100 examples of vernacular, often anonymous photographs from fields of medicine, forensics, space exploration and advertising prove that nonart photography is often as interesting as the fine-art variety. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)    * Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter)    Last Chance    * THE NAME OF THIS SHOW IS NOT GAY ART NOW Characterized by its organizer, the artist Jack Pierson, as an ode to the passing of ''the notion of Gay Art,'' this exhibition embraces the work of about 60 artists (gay, straight and otherwise) to create a cacophonous celebration and suggest that everyone is a little bit gay, if they are lucky. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, closes today.

5," Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film concert, show or exhibition.    Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'ALL THIS INTIMACY' Previews start Monday. Opens July 27. A romantically ambitious poet balances relationships with three women in this new play by Rajiv Joseph. Presented by Second Stage Theater (1:45). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway; (212) 246-4422.    'AMAJUBA: LIKE DOVES WE RISE' Previews start Thursday. Opens July 25. Based on the lives of the five cast members, this play, which incorporates dance and song, is about growing up in apartheid-era South Africa (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street; (212) 307-4100.    'BULLY' In previews. Opens on Tuesday. William Walsh plays Theodore Roosevelt in this solo show (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Manhattan; (212) 868-4444.    'CLOUD TECTONICS' In previews. Opens on Tuesday. ''School of the Americas'' playwright José Rivera revives this Los Angles romance about a man who picks up a hitchhiker who says she has been pregnant for two years (1:30). Culture Project-45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street; (212) 868-4444.    LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL Through July 30. This always buzzed-about summer showcase includes ''DruidSynge,'' the complete works of John Millington Synge; and ''Grendel,'' an opera directed by Julie Taymor. Sites in and around Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500.    'NO CHILD' In previews; opens on Sunday. The chameleonic Nilaja Sun returns with her acclaimed solo show about the New York public school system (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village; (212) 239-6200.    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Starts previews tonight; opens Thursday. When it originally opened in February, Charles Isherwood wrote: ''Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens'' (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)    'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE HOUSE IN TOWN'  A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich, who replaces Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' José Rivera, who wrote the screenplay to ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' penned this rickety piece of historical speculation about the final two days of Che Guevara's life (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Hunka)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'CHEKHOV & MARIA'  Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching, beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). The Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, between Second and Third Avenues, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)    'BEOWULF & GRENDEL' (R, 102 minutes) The director Sturla Gunnarsson boils this classic epic down into a generic action flick, complete with sweeping vistas, clanging fights, a chiseled hero and a witchy woman who keeps her front door unlocked for both the good guy and the bad. Every so often a severed head lazily rolls across the frame, though, alas, not often enough. (Dargis)    'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Stephen Holden)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)    'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)    'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES'  (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)    'THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL' (R, 88 minutes) The post-9/11 self-absorption of a handful of New Yorkers. Occasionally well observed, but mostly irritating and contrived. (Scott)    * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-age white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)    'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis)    'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)    'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)    'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)    * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)    * 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)    'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)    'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)    'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)    * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    Film Series    ANIMATION AROUND THE WORLD (Through July 31) BAMcinématek's festival of animated films begins Monday with a program of shorts by the Dutch director Paul Driessen, who worked on ''Yellow Submarine.'' Tuesday's program is ''Best of Ottawa 2005,'' a selection of shorts from the animation festival in that city, including Mary Newland's very short (50 seconds) comedy ''Signal Film.'' BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, between St. Felix Street and Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Anita Gates)    ESSENTIAL WILDER (Through Thursday) Film Forum's three-week retrospective of the work of the Polish-born director and screenwriter Billy Wilder (1906-2002) continues today and tomorrow with ''Ace in the Hole'' (1951), starring Kirk Douglas as an unscrupulous newspaper reporter. Sunday's feature is ''The Apartment'' (1960), Wilder's Oscar-winning comedy about a corporate love nest. The retrospective's closing-night film is ''The Fortune Cookie'' (1966), one of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's lesser-known collaborations. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-9110; $10. (Gates)    FRANK BORZAGE, HOLLYWOOD ROMANTIC (Through Aug. 20) A 24-film retrospective of Borzage (1893-1962), the first director to win an Oscar (for ''Seventh Heaven''), begins tomorrow at the Museum of the Moving Image. This weekend's films include ''Man's Castle'' (1933), a naughty romantic comedy with Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, and ''History Is Made at Night'' (1937), a romantic drama set on a Titanic-like ship, starring Jean Arthur and Charles Boyer. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    GREAT VILLAINS IN CINEMA (Through July 30) BAMcinématek is honoring movie bad guys, including Bela Lugosi in ''Dracula'' (1931) and Fredric March in ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' (1931). The weekend's other features are Hitchcock classics: ''Psycho'' (1960), starring Anthony Perkins as the disturbed motel owner Norman Bates, and ''Rebecca'' (1940), which stars Laurence Olivier (but the film's real villain is the dead title character). BAM Rose Cinemas, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    HEROIC GRACE: THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS FILM, PART II (Through Thursday) The U.C.L.A. Film & Television Archive and the Film Society of Lincoln Center's sequel to a 2003 festival focuses on movies from the 1970's and early 80's. This weekend's films include Lau Kar-leung's kung-fu comedy ''My Young Auntie'' (1980) and Zhang Che's ''Five Venoms'' (1978), about a dying master seeking revenge on his former disciples. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    HISTORIC HARLEM PARKS FESTIVAL: THROUGH AFRICAN EYES AND PRIZED PIECES (Through Aug. 3) This fifth annual outdoor festival continues Wednesday night with Cheik Doukouré's ''Golden Ball'' (1992), a film from Guinea about a very young football fan. Thursday night's feature is ''Buckle Brothers'' (2005), Marquette Williams's documentary about cowboys in South-Central Los Angeles. St. Nicholas Park, 135th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, (212) 352-1720; free. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    DAVE ALVIN (Tonight) In the Blasters, in X and now on his own, Mr. Alvin has written and sung about outcasts, lovers and criminals, some of the people who share the road with an itinerant musician. He sets his narratives in country and rockabilly tunes that strive for classic American simplicity, though his words detail an uncertain moral landscape. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Jon Pareles)    * AMADOU AND MARIAM (Sunday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album ''Dimanche à Bamako,'' last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock. With Daby Touré and Birdy Nam Nam. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Ben Sisario)    'AMERICAN IDOLS LIVE' (Tonight through Sunday) The 10 finalists from Season 5 of ''American Idol'' logged about a million yeah-yeah's and baby-baby's on television, and here they come on tour with who knows how many more: Taylor Hicks (the winner), Katharine McPhee (the runner-up), Ace Young, Bucky Covington, Chris Daughtry, Elliott Yamin, Kellie Pickler, Lisa Tucker, Mandisa and Paris Bennett. Tonight at 7, Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; tomorrow and Sunday nights at 7, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $36.50 to $70.50. (Sisario)    BON JOVI (Tuesday and Wednesday) Bon Jovi, the band that titled its 1998 album ''New Jersey,'' is back in its home state. Jon Bon Jovi's band conquered the airwaves in the 1980's and 90's by sticking together everything catchy about 70's rock: Bruce Springsteen's earnestness, Led Zeppelin's crunch, Boston's harmonies, and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. A photogenic lead singer doesn't hurt, either. With Nickelback. At 5 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $37.50 to $125. (Pareles)    BRAVE COMBO (Wednesday) Brave Combo, on a lifelong mission to prove the malleability of polka, plays an all-request show at Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center's outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing. At 7:30 p.m., with a dance lesson at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 875-5460; $15. (Sisario)    BRAVO SILVA, RAISING THE FAWN (Wednesday) Drawing on the spiky and melodic sound of the early Police and U2, the New York band Bravo Silva sings deadpan odes to the city of strangers, though not so deadpan as to exclude playing soaring, ecstatic choruses and having some fun with kitschy keyboards. This month the band has a Wednesday-night residency at Pianos. Also on the bill this week is Raising the Fawn, a group connected to the great Toronto indie-prog collective Broken Social Scene. At 6:30 p.m., 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733; $8. (Sisario)    KELLY CLARKSON (Tomorrow) The first ''American Idol'' champion, who won two Grammys and had the third-best-selling album of 2005, Ms. Clarkson is the best proof yet that reality television might not be a bad idea. With Rooney. At 8 p.m., New England Dodge Music Center, Hartford, (860) 548-7370; $25 to $75. (Sisario)    * DIPLO, CSS, BONDE DO ROLE (Wednesday and Thursday) Diplo, born Wesley Pentz -- his stage name is taken from diplodocus, a dinosaur -- is the influential and eclectic D.J. who has worked with the Sri Lankan-British rapper M.I.A., and is also half of Hollertronix, a virtuoso mixtape team from Philadelphia. He has been borrowing from Brazilian baile funk for years, and the first release on his new record label, Mad Descent, is by the Brazilian group Bonde do Role. Diplo is touring with that band and another Brazilian group, CSS, whose come-ons are shouted in robotic, broken English (''Kiss-kiss-kiss will make this earth quake'') over bare but exuberant art-funk. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; Thursday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sisario)    JOHN HIATT, NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tuesday) Mr. Hiatt has rhymed amoeba with Queen of Sheba; his songs get to the heart of human frailty, loyalty and love, even if they take a sidelong route. He performs with a deep-diving baritone, a twang-happy band and enough strange facial expressions to rival Jim Carrey. The North Mississippi Allstars play an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the hill country near where the members grew up, then turn it into jam-band music. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $30. (Pareles)    I LOVE YOU BUT I'VE CHOSEN DARKNESS (Wednesday) All is cold, echoey gloom in the music of this five-piece band from Austin, Tex., which borrows its spacious sound from Joy Division and its faint vocals from the shoe-gazer British bands of the late 1980's like My Bloody Valentine. With the Big Sleep and Asobi Seksu, a Brooklyn group whose new album, ''Citrus'' (Friendly Fire), shows a fine command of the shoe-gazer sound. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario)    * MADONNA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Part 10 (or so), in which our heroine strikes such poses as Jesus on the cross, James Brown in his cape and John Travolta in his white disco suit, all while performing dance-floor hits in new remixes and reconfigurations. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $354.50 tickets remaining. (Sisario)    MISSION OF BURMA (Tonight) In the early 1980's this innovative and widely influential Boston band brought sharp, brainy guitar minimalism to American postpunk, and since reuniting in 2002 after almost 20 years, it still plays with passion and smarts.

(Sisario)    MOBB DEEP, RAEKWON (Wednesday) Mobb Deep, a rap duo from Queens long admired by connoisseurs for its grim and vivid rhymes, was recently taken under 50 Cent's wing, with one result that you might expect: its new album, ''Blood Money'' (G Unit/Interscope), had its debut in the Top 10. Also on the bill is Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan, and a long lineup of opening acts including the Boot Camp Clik. At 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $35.

At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30. (Chinen)    MAYNARD FERGUSON & HIS BIG BOP NOUVEAU BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) His signature high notes have inevitably lost some luster, but Mr. Ferguson is still a bravura trumpeter and charismatic front man, and this 11-piece ensemble, under the musical direction of the drummer Stockton Helbing, suits both sets of skills. (Through July 23.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen)    * JAZZ IN JULY (Tuesday through Thursday) A year ago, the pianist Bill Charlap presided over his first season as artistic director of this venerable traditional jazz series, successfully clearing the bar set by his predecessor, Dick Hyman. The new season begins next week, with guest-laden tributes to Duke Ellington (Tuesday), Mr. Hyman (Wednesday) and Thelonious Monk (Thursday). Wynton Marsalis, making an appearance on the Monk evening, provides the most potent dose of jazz celebrity; but among this festival's regular patronage, Mr. Hyman himself looms just as large. Tickets will go quickly, if they haven't already. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500 or www.92y.org, $50.

(Chinen)    MARK MURPHY (Tomorrow) Mr. Murphy is a singer known mainly for sly insouciance, but on his recent album ''Once to Every Heart'' (Verve), he opted for a burnished and broken romanticism.

Opera    GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tomorrow and Sunday) This company's productions almost invariably end up at the New York City Opera, and lots of people drive up to Cooperstown, N.Y., to get an early glimpse of what's on the way. But Glimmerglass, with its intimate, comfortable and up-to-date house, is a vastly superior place to see and hear these productions than the cavernous New York State Theater. The company opened its season with a light work, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag. This week's schedule also includes Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' in a production by Leon Major. ''Pirates'': tomorrow night at 8; ''Barbiere'': Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255; $64 to $112. (Allan Kozinn)    'GRENDEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The wall works! The Lincoln Center Festival is breathing easy. As everyone seems to know by now, the Los Angeles Opera's premiere of ''Grendel,'' the operatic adaptation of John Gardner's 1971 novel, a retelling of the epic poem ''Beowulf,'' composed by Elliot Goldenthal and directed by Julie Taymor, had to be postponed when the 16-ton rotating wall that dominated the set would not rotate. Now installed at the New York State Theater, the wall is operating smoothly and the elaborate production, complete with Ms. Taymor's trademark puppets, tree-man creatures and flying dancers, seems glitch-free. Alas, Mr. Goldenthal's derivative music is like an ominous and obvious film score and the opera is weighted down with philosophical mumbo-jumbo. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 721-6500; $40 to $200. (Anthony Tommasini)    New Jersey Opera Theater (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the pre-eminent opera company for the state. Besides presenting performances, the company offers master classes and educational outreach programs. The productions include Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' directed by David Grabarkewitz and conducted by Brent McMunn, and an intriguing double bill of Puccini's comedy ''Gianni Schicchi'' and ''Buoso's Ghost,'' a one-act work from 1996 by Michael Ching, which picks up the story of the clever Schicchi where Puccini's opera leaves off. Steven Condy sings Schicchi in both works; James Caraher conducts. ''L'Elisir d'Amore'': tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m. and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; ''Schicchi'' and ''Buoso'': tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 to $49.

(Bernard Holland)    CARAMOOR (Tonight through Sunday, Thursday) The chamber ensemble Opus One frames its program of piano quartets tonight in favorites, with Mozart's Quartet in E flat (K. 493) to begin and Dvorak's Quartet in E flat (Op. 87) to close. Between them it offers a more recent adventure, George Tsontakis's Piano Quartet No. 3. Tomorrow night Michael Barrett conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's in the premiere of a Piano Concerto by John Musto, Caramoor's stylistically omnivorous composer in residence.

The series ends on Tuesday with the adventurous Marin Alsop conducting John Adams's ''Chairman Dances,'' Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1, with the virtuosic Leila Josefowicz as soloist, and Beethoven's always-popular Fifth Symphony.

(Anderson)    * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tomorrow, Sunday and Wednesday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center.

(Rockwell)    * PILOBOLUS (Monday through Thursday) The grandfather of the current crop of Nikolais-inspired, Cirque du Soleil-like acrobatic dance troupes with spectacular visual effects. A little mindless, maybe, but enormously popular for people of all ages. Monday is a special opening event combining parts of the two programs that will alternate for the rest of the run. Through Aug. 12. Monday through Thursday nights at 8, Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or joyce.org. $42. (Rockwell)    'RIVER DEEP, A TRIBUTE TO TINA TURNER'  (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday through Thursday) Gabrielle Lansner pays tribute to this singer, who is played by Pat Hall, in a multimedia production set to music by Philip Hamilton.

Through Aug. 16. At 6 p.m., Union Square Park, Broadway and 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 460-1208 or unionsquarenyc.org; free. (Anderson)    * TAP CITY 2006 (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) The festivities continue with performances of ''Tap Internationals'' tonight; ''Tap Forward,'' a program of contemporary choreography, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday nights; and ''Tap and Song,'' whose performers include Mable Lee and the festival director, Tony Waag, on Sunday and Wednesday nights. Tonight at 7 and 9:30; tomorrow and Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.; and Tuesday and Thursday at 7 and 9:30 p.m. The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, (212) 239-6200 and atdf.org; $40. (Dunning)    THOMAS/ORTIZ DANCE (Wednesday through Thursday) Ted Thomas and Frances Ortiz combine urban athleticism and Latin sensuality in choreographic explorations of socially relevant themes. Through July 22. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $15, $25. (Anderson)    DUSAN TYNEK DANCE THEATER  (Tonight through Sunday) Dusan Tynek, from Czechoslovakia, trained with Aileen Passloff at Bard College. He will present two premieres, one inspired by sinister 19th-century Czech ballads and set to string music by classical and contemporary composers, and the other set to music by Michael Galasso. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Dunning)    VON USSAR DANCEWORKS (Tonight through Sunday) Astrid von Ussar, a Slovenian modern-dance choreographer now based in New York City, will present four new and recent pieces, including her new ''23 hours,'' set to music by Graeme Ravell. The program features a dance by Mojca Ussar, her sister.

(Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    Bruce Museum: 'Best in Show: Dogs in Art From the Renaissance to the Present,' through Aug. 27. This show is a dog lover's picnic, with paintings that celebrate canis lupus familiaris and its wayward ways. 1 Museum Drive, Greenwich, Conn.; (203) 869-0376. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)    Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)    * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * Metropolitan museum of art: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)    Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)    Museum of Biblical Art: 'The Word on the Street: the photographs of Larry Racioppo,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Johnson)    * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)    * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/ Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art : 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)    * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    * HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.'  This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith)    * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    * 'A Four-Dimensional Being Writes Poetry on a Field with Sculptures' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West Second Street, (212) 243-0200, through Aug. 11. (Johnson)    'Small Wonders' Bucking the big-picture trend, this absorbing show presents 45 black-and-white photographs ranging from palm to postage-stamp size. They include classic portraits by Edward Weston and Berenice Abbott; André Kertesz's William-Blake-like image of a naked man walking into a field of tall grass; and Walter Auerbach's picture of Willem de Kooning's studio circa 1950. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 989-7600, through Aug. 25. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'About Light' Some works in this show, like Sean Scully's blocky grid painting and Philip Guston's smudgy gray abstraction, absorb more than emit light. Others, including Thomas Pihl's smooth, pink monochromes; Alex Katz's small nocturnal pictures of lighted apartment-building windows; and Richard Pousette-Dart's pulsating, pointillist field, seem to glow from within. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, through Aug. 4. (Johnson)    'Air' This appealing, understated show organized by the painter Amy Sillman includes Benjamin Butler's lush, Mondrian-style painting of trees; Pat Palermo's semi-abstract drawings of wrecked cars and other curious subjects; John White Cerasulo's watercolor of a bare-chested wilderness giant; Pamela Wilson-Ryckman's flickering picture of a scattering crowd of people; and abstractions in various styles by Robert Bordo, Jenny Monick, Howard Smith, Laura Newman and Patricia Treib. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 234-8645, through July 28. (Johnson)    * CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. CRG Gallery, 535 East 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, through July 28. (Smith)    'Everywhichway' This lively show of artists working inventively between abstraction and representation includes Katherine Bradford's whimsical images of ships and the sea; Chris Martin's updated Tantric art; Sigrid Sandström's Arctic icescapes; suave, retro-Modernist pattern paintings by Jennifer Riley and Colin Thomson; Harvey Tulcensky's finely textured ballpoint-pen fields; and compact, sensuous ceramic slabs by Joyce Robins. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565, through July 28. (Johnson)    'I'm not here. This isn't happening' With possibly the best title of the summer season, this group show includes Michelle Lopez's canny, neo-Surrealistic sculptures; Ronnie Bass's incantatory sound-and-video installation in a simulated old ship's cabin; Terry Haggerty's mesmerizing pattern paintings; Katarina Burin's noirish combinations of watercolor and found photography; Damien Cadio's enigmatic, painterly narratives; and Jim Gaylord's explosive, loosely Cubist paintings of natural and artificial fragments. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-2388, through Aug. 4. (Johnson)Smith)    * THE NAME OF THIS SHOW IS NOT GAY ART NOW Characterized by its organizer, the artist Jack Pierson, as an ode to the passing of ''the notion of Gay Art,'' this exhibition embraces the work of about 60 artists (gay, straight and otherwise) to create a cacophonous celebration and suggest that everyone is a little bit gay, if they are lucky. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, through tomorrow. (Smith)    'The Sanctuary and the Scrum' A diverting, pluralistic show inaugurates a new Northwest Chelsea exhibition space. It includes good abstract and semi-abstract paintings by Jessica Dickinson and Andrew Guenther; a stuffed swan shorn of its feathers from the head down by Jane Benson; a gleaming crutch covered by tiny mirror facets by Kristian Kozul; and a funny photo-conceptual project about grocery store shopping carts by Julian Montague. Black & White, 636 West 28th Street, (212) 244-3007, through July 29. (Johnson)    Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson)    * Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the famed modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    'How I Finally Accepted Fate' The memoir is the loosely defined theme of this interesting 10-person show. It includes Matt Keegan's video of cheerleaders celebrating his grandmother's 90th birthday; Angela Dufresne's vivid painting of a shirtless man called ''Me as a Communist Male in 'The Red and the White' ''; Carolee Schneemann's patchwork tale about modern love in photographs and typewritten words; and Maureen Duncan's three-and-a-half-hour monologue about her CD collection. EFA Gallery, 323 West 39th Street, (212) 563-5855, through July 28. (Johnson)    Christine Osinski: 'Notes From West Brighton' Ms. Osinski took the visually and sociologically gripping photographs in this exhibition on Staten Island, where she lives, in the early 1980's and the early 90's. These exceptionally lucid black-and-white pictures of nondescript neighborhoods, grocery store customers, small-town parades, self-consciously posing teenagers and abandoned wrecked cars were made with an affectionately cool, clear eye for the beauty and weirdness of ordinary people and places. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, East Village, (212) 505-9156, through July 30. (Johnson)    Last Chance    Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black-and-white grid painted on the walls, a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design, and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love,'' depicting the goddess of love and the god of war in an intimate moment brokered by Cupid, as Mars's sexy horse looks on. The other works are a little more staid, but the painting in them is equally gorgeous. (See above.) 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, closes Sunday. (Glueck)    EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING'  This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166; closes tomorrow. (Glueck)    Cosima von Bonin: 'Relax, It's Only a Ghost' Various two- and three-dimensional objects -- including stuffed animals like the ones you might find in a high-end toy store -- and Rorschach test patterns stitched to colorful bedspreads add up to a familiar critique of consumerism. Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467; closes today. (Johnson)    Invisible Might: Works from 1965-1971' This luminous group show about the euphoric convergence of Minimalism and new technologies in the late 1960's and early 70's includes a smoky glass cube by Larry Bell; a solid black plastic cube by John McCracken; a tall, clear acrylic prism by Robert Irwin; a beautiful aqua-green light projection by James Turrell; a yellow molded plastic relief by Craig Kauffman; and a corner composition of elastic cords and bent metal rods by Fred Sandback. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212) 995-1785; closes today.

This always buzzed-about summer showcase includes ''DruidSynge,'' the complete works of John Millington Synge, and ''Grendel,'' an opera directed by Julie Taymor. Sites in and around Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500.    'NO CHILD' Previews start tomorrow. Opens July 16. The chameleonic Nilaja Sun returns with her acclaimed solo show about the New York public school system (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village; (212) 239-6200.    Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE HOUSE IN TOWN'  A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka)    'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'GODOT HAS LEFT THE BUILDING' John Griffin's homage to Samuel Beckett's classic play nails the master's comedy but falls short of his lyricism, though it features fine performances from Scott David Nogi and Edward Griffin (2:00). 45 Below Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Hunka)    'MACBETH' As Mr. and Mrs. MacB, Liev Schreiber and Jennifer Ehle inscribe thoughtful studies in the excesses of ambition and the ultimately annihilating prickings of conscience. But in Moisés Kaufman's elegantly wrought production set in the tumultuous 1930's, the Macbeths' murderous rampage unfolds at an oddly stately pace. Blood flows regularly, but as if it's being dispensed from silver taps. Despite the intelligence and craft of their performances, neither Mr. Schreiber nor Ms. Ehle seems to inhabit fully the darkness of their characters. (2:25). Delacorte Theater, Central Park West and 81st Street, (212) 539-8750; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will & Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)    'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)    'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)    'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES'  (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)    'THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL' (R, 88 minutes) The post-9/11 self-absorption of a handful of New Yorkers. Occasionally well observed, but mostly irritating and contrived. (Scott)    'THE GREAT YOKAI WAR' (No rating, 124 minutes, in Japanese) From the prolific Japanese cult director Takashi Miike comes this extravagantly imagined fable about a boy who joins a band of cute magical creatures locked in an apocalyptic struggle against some who are much less cute. (Scott)    'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)    'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)    'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)    'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)    * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)    'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánomo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)    * 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee)    'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    * 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of João Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee)    'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)    'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall.

(PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    Film Series    ESSENTIAL WILDER (Through July 20) Film Forum's three-week retrospective of the work of the great Polish-born director and screenwriter Billy Wilder (1906-2002) continues today and tomorrow with ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), his classic Hollywood drama about a young screenwriter (William Holden) and an aging silent-screen star (Gloria Swanson).

AMADOU AND MARIAM (Thursday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album ''Dimanche à Bamako,'' last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock.

(Sisario)    FRUIT BATS (Thursday) The Fruit Bats, from Chicago, play weightless little nuggets of psych-folk that are deceptively wistful. Behind their apparent melancholy is a playful wit and a modest awe: ''It takes leviathans down in the abyss,'' sings Eric Johnson, the band's leader. ''The hidden messages of the things that you missed.'' With Higgins. At 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario)    HAKIM (Tomorrow) Hakim is a superstar in his native Egypt, singing a high-energy dance update of shaabi, an irreverent and streetwise pop style. (Its name means ''of the people.'') He borrows Western beats, and some big Western voices too -- the stars with whom he has sung include James Brown and Olga Tañón. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested.

(Sisario)    JOLIE HOLLAND (Tuesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming and deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), is a wry, greet-the-morning scene that finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. At 8 p.m., Canal Room. (See above.) $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)    * LES SAVY FAV, BEANS, DRAGONS OF ZYNTH (Sunday) The most exciting news about the summer concert season is the unexpected arrival of the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The first concert features the arch postpunk band Les Savy Fav, the alternative rapper Beans and Dragons of Zynth, a talked-about new band whose sound is called ''Afrotek.''

(Kelefa Sanneh)    LIFETIME, THE BRONX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Lifetime was a standard-issue hardcore punk band from New Jersey in the mid-1990's -- lots of slashing, melodic guitars and accusatory lyrics -- that has been enjoying a small renaissance since reuniting recently, after almost a decade. The Bronx -- which hails from Los Angeles, not New York -- plays a violently propulsive and proudly obnoxious kind of strut-punk that comes down from Black Flag and the MC5. With the Loved Ones. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; sold out.

(Sisario)    MOUTHUS, COUGHS (Tonight) An evening of grungy, discordant and exhilarating noise-rock. Mouthus, a fearsomely unpredictable duo from Brooklyn, delves into guttural depths of guitar and vocals, and Coughs, a six-piece band from Chicago, offers tortured singing above a malevolent rumble of percussion. Also on the bill are members of the clamorous Sightings and the gloomy but strangely not very noisy Bret Gand Is Dead. At 8, Goodbye Blue Monday, 1087 Broadway, at DeKalb Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn, (718) 453-6343; $8. (Sisario)    * ONEIDA (Thursday) Things are best in Oneida songs when the various patterns of drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones that seem to summon some primordial rock energy. And though this veteran Brooklyn band's new album, ''Happy New Year'' (Jagjaguwar), also toys with some medieval-ish folk, there is plenty of that eerie, cathartic drone. With Dirty Faces, Company and Knyfe Hytes. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door.

(Sisario)    SOILENT GREEN (Sunday) Soilent Green, from Louisiana, seems hell-bent on reinventing Southern rock in its own gloomy image.

(Sanneh)    ANGIE STONE (Tonight) This neo-soul singer performs her tales of tough-minded affection with gutsy directness, not bothering with distracting vocal gymnastics. At 8, B. B.

(Pareles)    UNCLE MONK (Monday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this new acoustic duo, singing tautly written songs -- much like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. At 9 p.m., Parkside Lounge, 317 East Houston Street, between Clinton and Attorney Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 673-6270; $5. (Sisario)    YO LA TENGO (Thursday) This enduring indie-rock band, with its lean guitar riffs and feedback excursions, takes a detour into soundtrack territory.

At 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)    YURA YURA TEIKOKU (Tomorrow and Sunday) Long a major player in Japan's garage-punk-revival scene -- which is bigger, and better, than you might think -- this three-piece band made a splash at its first New York concerts last year, and returns for two more. With dry, bluesy guitars and strutting rhythms, it has perfected a stylish synthesis of the sounds of ''Beggars Banquet''-era Rolling Stones and scraggy 1960's psychedelic groups like the 13th Floor Elevators. Tomorrow night at 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. Sunday night at 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10.

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs.

REZ ABBASI AND SNAKE CHARMER (Tuesday) Mr. Abbasi's most recent album, ''Snake Charmer'' (Arabesque), infuses traditional North Indian motifs with rock bombast, jazz flexibility and a Hammond B-3 organ; in some ways this guitarist and his band offer a postmillennial update of the 1970's fusion of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.

(Chinen)    DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Tonight) As the name implies, this 18-piece big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a sound that suggests Steve Reich minimalism as well as orchestral jazz in the lineage of Bob Brookmeyer.

At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    DANIEL SMITH QUARTET (Tuesday) Mr. Smith, one of the very few credible jazz bassoonists, performs with a rhythm section that regularly works on its own as the Don Friedman Trio. At 8 p.m., St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 935-2200; suggested donation, $15; $10 for students. (Chinen)    TYSHAWN SOREY'S OBLIQUITY (Sunday) Mr. Sorey, an often incendiary drummer, features his own compositions in this ensemble, which consists of the alto saxophonist Loren Stillman, the trombonist Ben Gerstein, the guitarist Terry McManus, the pianist Jacob Sacks and the bassist Chris Lightcap. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    MELVIN SPARKS BAND (Tonight) With ''Groove On Up'' (Savant), Mr. Sparks renews his claim on clean-toned funk guitar playing, in a line of descent stretching down from Grant Green. His working band includes Nate Lucus on Hammond B-3 organ and Shawn Hill on drums. At 12:30 a.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $10, with a $5 minimum.

He plays here with a pair of frequent collaborators, Jacob Sacks on keyboards and Thomas Morgan on bass. At 8 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, near Third Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, www.schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12.

Opera    GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Monday) This company's productions almost invariably end up at New York City Opera, and lots of people drive to Cooperstown to get an early glimpse of what's on the way. But Glimmerglass, with its intimate, comfortable and up-to-date house, is a vastly better place to see and hear these productions than City Opera's cavernous New York State Theater. The company opens its season with a light work, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag. Alternating with ''Pirates,'' through Monday, is Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' in a production by Leon Major. ''Pirates'': tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 1:30; ''Barbiere'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Monday at 1:30 p.m., Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255; $64 to $112 tonight, tomorrow and Sunday; sold out on Monday. (Allan Kozinn)    'GRENDEL' (Tuesday and Thursday) The soap opera -- delayed opening, restaging problems -- attached to the Los Angeles production of Elliot Goldenthal's new opera ''Grendel'' has evidently been resolved, and Julie Taymor's elaborate staging arrives at the New York State Theater as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $40 to $200. (Bernard Holland)    NEW JERSEY OPERA THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the state's pre-eminent opera company. In addition to performances, it offers master classes and educational outreach programs. Its summer season begins tonight with Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte,'' directed by Albert Sherman and conducted by Steven Mosteller. Tomorrow night, Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore'' takes the stage in a production directed by David Grabarkewitz and conducted by Brent McMunn. From all reports the casts are young, eager and gifted. Both Mozart's and Donizetti's stories of confused young lovers can gain extra poignancy when performed by emerging artists. ''Così Fan Tutte'': tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; ''L'Elisir d'Amore'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 to $49. (Anthony Tommasini)    Classical Music    MARTINA ARROYO YOUNG ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tomorrow) The New York-born soprano Martina Arroyo, who had a long career at the Metropolitan Opera, has in recent years been immersed in the work of the Martina Arroyo Foundation, which recruits, coaches and presents young singers in concert performances of operas. Tomorrow the young artists take on Verdi's delightful and quite challenging final opera, ''Falstaff,'' in a concert performance. The conductor will be Willie Anthony Waters, the general and artistic director of the Connecticut Opera Association. At 3 p.m., the Liederkranz Foundation, 6 East 87th Street, Manhattan, (347) 677-3854; free. (Tommasini)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Tonight Alexander Fiterstein, a highly regarded clarinetist, and Steven Beck, a fine pianist, play a freewheeling program that ranges from Weber's Grand Duo Concertante and Lutoslawski's ''Dance Preludes'' to Schumann's ''Fantasiestücke'' and Giampieri's ''Carnival of Venice'' Variations. Tomorrow and Sunday Dvorak's exquisite and rarely heard Terzetto figures into a program that also includes string quartets by Haydn and Beethoven, and Gyorgy Ligeti's Sonata for Solo Cello, to be played by Nicholas Canellakis. And on Thursday Mr. Beck returns on his own, to play Stravinsky, Brahms, Haydn and Schubert. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083; $35 tonight and Thursday, $40 tomorrow and Sunday. (Kozinn)    NAUMBURG ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) George Garrett Keast leads this summertime orchestra in the second of its four free concerts this summer. The program includes Stravinsky's delightful ''Pulcinella'' Suite, Beethoven's Eighth Symphony and, with Andrew Armstrong as the soloist, Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24. At 7:30 p.m., Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (718) 340-3018. (Kozinn)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series -- conceived as a way for the orchestra to get its money's worth from the players during the off weeks of late June -- is back. The idea is to present programs of mostly lighter and familiar fare at reduced ticket prices. Still, last summer Bramwell Tovey proved not only a lively conductor but also an avuncular host whose comments to the audience were witty and informative. The series ends this weekend with Mr. Tovey conducting Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' Overture, Saint-Saëns's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol'' and Ravel's ''Boléro.'' Are there four more familiar and popular pieces in the repertory? At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $19 to $49. (Tommasini)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC'S CONCERTS IN THE PARKS (Tuesday through Thursday) After the Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series ends tomorrow, the orchestra leaves the air-conditioned confines of Avery Fisher Hall for its annual series of free concerts in the parks. The Philharmonic's dynamic associate conductor, Xian Zhang, offers two Tchaikovsky works, the ''Festival Coronation March'' and the Violin Concerto (with the charismatic violinist Jennifer Koh as soloist), and Dvorak's exuberant Symphony No. 8. Expect these concerts to draw tens of thousands of people for picnics in the parks and music under (if nature cooperates) the stars. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Prospect Park ball fields, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Great Lawn, Central Park; Thursday at 8 p.m., Cunningham Park, Francis Lewis Boulevard and Union Turnpike, Fresh Meadows, Queens; (212) 875-5709. (Tommasini)    SUMMERGARDEN (Sunday) The Museum of Modern Art begins its annual summer series of free concerts in the Sculpture Garden with music from Sweden, Bolivia, France and the United States. Current and recent students at the Juilliard School will play, directed by Joel Sachs. First come first served. Enter through the garden gate on 54th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. The music will move inside in case of rain. At 8 p.m., (212) 708-9491. (Holland)    * TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) When James Levine injured his shoulder early this year, forcing him to cancel his conducting commitments for the rest of the season, his doctors said he would most likely be ready to conduct when Tanglewood opened. Some doubt remained until recent weeks, but Mr. Levine said he would be up for the opening program, tonight, in which he is to lead the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. His soloists are Sondra Radvanovsky, Wendy White, Clifton Forbis and John Relyea. Bernard Haitink then takes over the rest of the weekend, for programs of Ravel, Mozart, Debussy and Roussel tomorrow evening, and Sibelius and Mahler on Sunday afternoon. His soloists are the pianist Emanuel Ax tomorrow and the violinist Joshua Bell on Sunday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200; $17 to $98. (Kozinn)    WASHINGTON SQUARE MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tuesday) The music is by or about Mozart. The performers are Eriko Sato and the festival's chamber orchestra. The concert is free. At 8 p.m., Washington Square Park South, Greenwich Village, (212) 252-3621. (Holland)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    CAPACITOR (Wednesday and Thursday) From San Francisco, Capacitor creates pieces based on science. In ''Digging in the Dark,'' the focus is on modern geophysics and acrobatic, virtuosic movement. Through July 30. Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8. American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101 or www.capacitor.org; $35. (Jennifer Dunning)    Chunky Move (Tuesday through Thursday) Apparently, Australian men have dancing difficulties too. Perhaps not these particular men, though; employing video montages and interviews, the members of the physical Australian troupe Chunky Move channel their inner wallflowers in ''I Want to Dance Better at Parties.'' Through July 15. At 8 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $36. (Claudia La Rocco)    PAULA HUNTER (Monday through Thursday) Ms. Hunter will perform ''I Am Karen Finley,'' an absurdist performance solo, as a free dance installation in a window in the theater district. Through July 22. Monday through Thursday at 5 and 7:30 p.m., Chashama, 112 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 391-8151 or www.chashama.org. (Dunning)    * JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The Suzanne Farrell Ballet from Washington will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend in an all-Balanchine program, followed there on Wednesday and Thursday (and next weekend) by Tania Pérez-Salas's company from Mexico. In the smaller Doris Duke Studio Theater, Emanuel Gat Dance from Israel plays through this weekend, with Robert Moses' Kin from San Francisco moving in on Thursday through next weekend. Suzanne Farrell tonight and tomorrow at 8 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; $50. Pérez-Salas Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, Shawn Theater; $45. Gat tonight and tomorrow at 2:15 and 8:15 p.m., and Sunday at 5 p.m. Moses Thursday at 8:15 p.m., Duke Theater, $24. Ten percent off all tickets for students, ages 65+ and children. Details of the week's free performances and exhibitions can be found at jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass.; (413) 243-0745. (John Rockwell)    * LA MAMA MOVES! (Tonight through Sunday) Six choreographers from around the world, including Bill Irwin, will perform in ''Border Jumping'' in the closing weekend of this festival, whose curators were Nicky Paraiso and Mia Yoo. Tonight through Sunday night at 7:30. ''Mavericks in Motion,'' featuring nine choreographers who include Justin Montalvo, Christopher Morgan and Kate Weare, will also be performed. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2:30 and 8 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; $10 (Dunning)    * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tomorrow) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 until the end of the month, although this week there will be only two performances. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell)    PAUFVE DANCE (Tonight through Sunday night) From San Francisco, Randee Paufve and her dancers, who range in age from 22 to 72, will present ''The Big Squeeze,'' a program of dances about love, home, space and place. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-7479 or www.paufvedance.org; $15; $13 for students and 65+. (Dunning)    * ROXANE BUTTERFLY (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Djellaba Groove'' ain't your grandmother's tap. This performer mixes in flamenco, multilingual spoken word and North African rhythms to give this New World art form some Old World flair. And it gets better: her show is paired with the terrific Noche Flamenca at the SummerStage performance. Tonight, 8 to 10:30, summerstage.org Free. Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200 or telecharge.com; $15 (La Rocco)    * TAP CITY (Sunday through July 22) Six years ago the irrepressible Tony Waag, fed up with the lack of performing opportunities for tap dancers in New York, started this festival. Who says you can't please all of the people all of the time? From rarely seen films to master classes with and performances by today's brightest American and international hoofers, Mr. Waag's boisterous creation promises something for everyone. From 8 to 11 p.m., the festival opens with a free tap jam at Pier 63 Maritime, West 23rd Street at the Hudson River, Chelsea. For a complete festival schedule, visit atdf.org. (La Rocco)    DUSAN TYNEK DANCE THEATER  (Thursday) Dusan Tynek, from Czechoslovakia, trained with Aileen Passloff at Bard College. He will present two premieres, one inspired by sinister 19th-century Czech ballads and set to string music by classical and contemporary composers, and the other set to music by Michael Galasso. Through July 16. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Dunning)    VON USSAR DANCEWORKS (Thursday) Astrid von Ussar, a Slovenian modern-dance choreographer now based in New York City, will present four new and recent pieces, including her new ''23 hours,'' set to music by Graeme Ravell. The program features a dance by Mojca Ussar, her sister. Through July 16. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $25 for opening night performance and reception. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)    Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)    * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * Metropolitan museum of art: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)    Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)    * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)    * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art : 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)    * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    * HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.'  This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith)    * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'Air' This appealing, understated show organized by the painter Amy Sillman includes Benjamin Butler's lush, Mondrian-style painting of trees; Pat Palermo's semi-abstract drawings of wrecked cars and other curious subjects; John White Cerasulo's watercolor of a bare-chested wilderness giant; Pamela Wilson-Ryckman's flickering picture of a scattering crowd of people; and abstractions in various styles by Robert Bordo, Jenny Monick, Howard Smith, Laura Newman and Patricia Treib. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 234-8645, through July 28. (Johnson)    'Everywhichway' This lively show of artists working inventively between abstraction and representation includes Katherine Bradford's whimsical images of ships and the sea; Chris Martin's updated Tantric art; Sigrid Sandström's Arctic icescapes; suave, retro-Modernist pattern paintings by Jennifer Riley and Colin Thomson; Harvey Tulcensky's finely textured ballpoint-pen fields; and compact, sensuous ceramic slabs by Joyce Robins. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565, through July 28. (Johnson)    'The Sanctuary and the Scrum' A diverting, pluralistic show inaugurates a new Northwest Chelsea exhibition space. It includes good abstract and semi-abstract paintings by Jessica Dickinson and Andrew Guenther; a stuffed swan shorn of its feathers from the head down by Jane Benson; a gleaming crutch covered by tiny mirror facets by Kristian Kozul; and a funny photo-conceptual project about grocery store shopping carts by Julian Montague. Black & White, 636 West 28th Street, (212) 244-3007, through July 29. (Johnson)    Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson)    * Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the famed modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    Christine Osinski: 'Notes From West Brighton' Ms. Osinski took the visually and sociologically gripping photographs in this exhibition on Staten Island, where she lives, in the early 1980's and the early 90's. These exceptionally lucid black-and-white pictures of nondescript neighborhoods, grocery store customers, small-town parades, self-consciously posing teenagers and abandoned wrecked cars were made with an affectionately cool, clear eye for the beauty and weirdness of ordinary people and places. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, East Village, (212) 505-9156, through July 30. (Johnson)    Last Chance    Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, closing today. (Johnson)    MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' . Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Met, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of its department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710, closing Sunday. (Glueck)    'Nightmares of Summer' This entertaining selection of dark, weird and nasty visions includes Marilyn Minter's big photograph of dirty feet with toenails painted fashionably green; Barnaby Furnas's explosive, cartoonish painting of a woman at the beach spilling blood-red wine; an otherworldly coppery seascape by Stuart Elster; photographs by Anders Petersen, Hans Bellmer and Diane Arbus; drawings by Carroll Dunham and Steve DiBenedetto; and more. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-3363, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    HALSEY RODMAN: 'THE NAVIGATOR'S QUARTERS MUST NOT BE DISTURBED' A solo debut introduces a multi-talented sculptor who lets his work bog down in an obscure narrative, but still cuts loose with a sufficiently engaging array of techniques, materials and colors. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    'Scarecrow' The work in this show is supposed to be menacing and abrasive, but it is mostly interesting and amusing. Highlights include David Herbert's giant, handmade replica of a ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' videocassette; Rashid Johnson's life-size, photographic nude self-portrait; David Kennedy Cutler's model of the White House made of chewing gum and imbedded in dirt; and a short Matthew Barney-like film by Chris Larson. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * Stephen Shore The postcard-size color pictures of diners, restaurant meals, hotel rooms, roadside signs, ordinary people and other nondescript subjects taken by this eminent photographer on cross-country road trips in the early 1970's are enthralling, beautiful, nostalgic and romantic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, closing today.
