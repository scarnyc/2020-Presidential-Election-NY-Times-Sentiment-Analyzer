2," A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.    Opera    ''IDOMENEO, RE DI CRETA.'' Mozart does best in an intimate setting, and the former sculpture studio that houses the performances of Vertical Player Repertory is one of the most intimate spaces for opera in all of New York. In fact the audience, crammed in on cushions on the floor, may hardly outnumber the forces onstage, since Judith Barnes has mustered a chorus of nearly 20 voices strong for her production. Ms. Barnes, a sculptor-turned-singer who founded the company in 1998, is also taking on the lead role of Elettra; Aram Tchobanian sings the title role; and the orchestra, squeezed in around the audience, will be conducted by Nizan Leibovich. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Vertical Player Repertory, 219 Court Street, Brooklyn, (212) 539-2696. Suggested admission: $20 (Anne Midgette).",https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/27/movies/classical-music-and-dance-guide.html,,"A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.",The New York Times,[],[],2003-06-27T05:00:00+0000,article,"Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk",Movies,,Schedule,nyt://article/a0a0edf3-c48e-5549-ae61-8c23f4c3d9cf,3375,nyt://article/a0a0edf3-c48e-5549-ae61-8c23f4c3d9cf,CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE,,,CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE,,,,,[],,E,21
