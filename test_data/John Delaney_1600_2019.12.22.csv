1," Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'DAPH!'

'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' Opens Wednesday. What hath gay marriage wrought? Find out in the Five Lesbian Brothers' comic spin on Greek tragedy, which they are calling the ''feel weird lesbian tragicomedy of the year'' (1:30).

On the verge of retirement, an English teacher reflects on what might have been in Dan O'Brien's new play (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212)246-4422.    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Opens Aug. 18. Nathan Lane and Marian Seldes star in a new Terrence McNally play about a couple who want to buy a theater in upstate New York (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.

Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Aug. 9. Has the prospect of the end of the ''Star Wars'' series sent you into a deep, dark depression? Cheer up with Charles Ross's light-speed spin through the original three movies (you know, the good ones), in which he plays all the parts, including the ships (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.    Broadway     'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300.(Charles Isherwood)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'  (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schreiber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'PRIMO' In his crystalline adaptation of ''If This Is a Man,'' Primo Levi's memoir of the Holocaust, Antony Sher creates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of existence. His great accomplishment is in doing so in an expressly theatrical language that never sensationalizes, lectures or begs for pity (1:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz is himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Isherwood)    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful and funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful emotional crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)    'THE SKIN GAME' A powerful performance by James Gale propels the Mint Theater's revival of ''The Skin Game.'' The Nobel laureate John Galsworthy's drama about two English families whose differences escalate into destructive conflict provides provocative and entertaining theater (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Van Gelder)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)    *'WALK TWO MOONS' Theaterworks/NYC, the new, ''stationary'' arm of the traveling group Theaterworks/USA, starts things off with an appealing adaptation of the tweener novel by Sharon Creech, a Newbery Medal winner. A 13-year-old girl travels cross-country with her nutty grandparents in search of her mother, telling a tallish tale about her friend Phoebe along the way, to hilarious effect (1:10). Lortel, 121 Christopher Street, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger)    Off Off Broadway    * 'BUSTED JESUS COMIX' Based on the story of the only cartoonist ever to be tried and convicted of obscenity, this nicely performed 65-minute satire belongs to a rich dramatic tradition of turning dirty-minded artists into First Amendment heroes. David Johnston's script touches on the trial and fills out an invented biography that gives the play a satisfying arc. Access Theater , 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman)    'THE GUT GIRLS' Like the large unwieldy carcass the Victorian-era characters must tackle in a slaughterhouse, this preachy British play by Sarah Daniels doesn't yield to either the director or the dialect coach in this revival, though several actresses manage to surmount the obstacles in a fashion (2:45). Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212)868-4444. (Stevens)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS'  Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'TOP TEN' Peter Gil-Sheridan's ''Top Ten'' is a paint-by-numbers series of stereotypes. The cardboard characters and predictable permutations are, in fact, numbered. Each vignette is presented as a sort of plot equation that never really adds up. This theatrical lottery, lasting more than two hours, may soon make you feel in need of a remedial math course. ''Top Ten'' is even less than the sum of its parts. Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, near 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.     *'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of the 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Manohla Dargis)    *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    *'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)    'THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY' (R, 125 minutes, in English and Vietnamese) A young man leaves Vietnam hoping to find his father, an American soldier. Earnest and sometimes clumsy, but also affecting. (A.O. Scott)    'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH'  (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'CRÓNICAS' (R, 98 minutes, in Spanish and English) John Leguizamo is an ambitious, unscrupulous Miami reporter for a tabloid television show on the track of a serial murderer of children in an Ecuadorian village. (Holden)    'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)     *'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)     * 'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis)    'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be this  silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut, gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden)      'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    *'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)     'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER'  (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)      *'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation and about how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)      'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MAKING GRACE' (No rating, 86 minutes) An intimate documentary focusing on a 30-something lesbian couple who want to become parents, this is the kind of film rarely seen by those who would benefit most from its universal message.(Jeannette Catsoulis)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)     'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of the exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)    'NOVEMBER' (R, 89 minutes) The twisty paranoid thriller about a photographer's survivor's guilt and repressed memory in the wake of her boyfriend's murder is a surreal cinematic mind-tickler with not much behind its clever facade. (Holden)      * 'SARABAND' (R, 107, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden)     *'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)     ' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series     'THE CONFORMIST' (through Aug. 11). Film Forum is screening a new 35-millimeter print of Bernardo Bertolucci's 1970 masterpiece about sex and politics in pre-World War II Italy. Jean-Louis Trintignant stars as a young Fascist assigned to assassinate his onetime mentor in Paris. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates)    'DIVAS!' (through Aug. 30). This summer festival, presented by Thalia Film Classics, honors great women in classical movies, with dramas this weekend about movie actresses in doomed relationships. Judy Garland stars in the 1954 ''A Star Is Born,'' about a celebrity whose husband (James Mason) is destroyed by her outshining him. And in ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), Gloria Swanson plays a has-been silent-screen star who passionately befriends an aspiring young screenwriter (William Holden). Both films play tomorrow and Tuesday. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-1414, $10. (Gates)     'IN DEPPTH' (through Sunday) BAM Cinématek concludes its 11-film, three-week retrospective of Johnny Depp's films this weekend. Lasse Hallstrom's ''What's Eating Gilbert Grape?'' (1993), about a small-town Iowa family with multiple problems, is being shown today. Tomorrow and Sunday, the feature is Jim Jarmusch's anti-western ''Dead Man'' (1995), in which Mr. Depp plays a 19th-century accountant not long for this world. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)777-3456 or (718)636-4100, $10. (Gates)    ERNST LUBITSCH FILM FESTIVAL (through Aug. 6). Makor, a program of the 92nd Street Y, is screening five films by Lubitsch (1892-1947) on consecutive Saturdays. Tomorrow's feature is ''Ninotchka'' (1939), starring Greta Garbo as a stern Soviet functionary in Paris, tempted by capitalist luxuries and romance. 35 West 67th Street, (212)601-1000, $9. (Gates)     RAOUL WALSH RETROSPECTIVE (through Aug. 14). The Museum of the Moving Image's 23-film tribute to Walsh (1887-1980) continues tomorrow with ''They Died With Their Boots On'' (1941), starring Errol Flynn as George Armstrong Custer. ''Desperate Journey'' (1942), a war movie with Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan, plays on Sunday. ''High Sierra'' (1941), a gangster film noir with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino, will be shown on Saturday and Sunday. 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)-784-0077, $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    AFRICAN FESTIVAL WITH THOMAS MAPFUMO AND THE BLACKS UNLIMITED, MARIA DE BARROS AND OTHERS (Sunday) A musical pioneer, the Zimbabwean Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled Rhodesian government. His music transferred the brisk patterns of thumb piano to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. The best-known music from Cape Verde is the lilting and pensive morna. Maria de Barros sings some mornas, but also sings other Cape Verdean styles -- including bright, driving funanas -- about love, tradition and women's strength. Gokh-Bi System, Kakande and Alain Nkossi Konda also play. 2 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, free. (Jon Pareles)    BABY DAYLINER, GREG GARING, GRANT HART (Tonight) Baby Dayliner is the stage name of Ethan Marunas, a keyboard-driven one-man band. He sets up percolating electropop patterns to back neo-cabaret songs that can be droll and cynical or stylishly heartsick. Greg Garing is a songwriter who prizes both the heart-on-sleeve simplicity of honky-tonk and the possibilities of electronica. Grant Hart played pop melodic foil to the more angular Bob Mould in the seminal post-punk band Hüsker Dü. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Pareles)     BANG ON A CAN (Tuesday) Members of the forward-thinking chamber-music group Bang on a Can All-Stars play a gig with visiting Uzbek musicians. Bang on a Can performers include the percussionist David Cossin, the guitarist Mark Stewart, the cellist Wendy Sutter and the bassist Gregg August. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $10. (Laura Sinagra)    BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Tomorrow, Sunday and Tuesday) This band's frontman Anton Newcombe resembles the Rolling Stones' washout genius Brian Jones in both his love for wan 1960's psychedelics and his flirtatious relationship with reality. The 2004 rock documentary ''Dig!'' showcases his mix of retro integrity and epic narcissism. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15 to $17. Tuesday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $12 (sold out). (Sinagra)    *THE CASTLE FESTIVAL: WELCOMING THE WORLD FOR 150 YEARS (Sunday) Some 74 million Americans had ancestors who passed through the Castle Garden Immigrant Depot in Battery Park. This concert celebrating its 150th anniversary is a showcase for some of the music and ideas immigrants have brought to the city, with hard-charging salsa by the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, modal Middle-Eastern jazz from Simon Shaheen's Qantara, Irish immigration songs sung by Susan McKeown, African dance by the group Kotchegna, and Albanian traditional and pop songs from Merita Halili and the accordion-powered Raif Hyseni Orchestra. 4:30 to 10 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, www.thebattery.org, free. (Pareles)     CROSBY, STILLS AND NASH (Monday and Tuesday) Self-satisfied baby-boom nostalgia and close high harmonies that may be more or less in tune. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070, $40 to $100. (Pareles)    DEAD MEADOW (Thursday) Dead Meadow plays hard rock that evokes rolling expanse the way the blues-metal the group loves once evoked misty Gothic castles. This monstrously riff-heavy band's punk roots give its grandeur a humane warmth. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $10. (Sinagra)    DESTINY'S CHILD, AMERIE (Tonight and tomorrow) The R&B diva Beyoncé can seem a bit strident in her pursuit of media-blessed perfection, but her urgent, flexible voice is certainly that of a superstar. This concert is supposedly the swan song of the trio known for hits like the sublime heartbreaker ''Say My Name'' and the prematurely hardened ''Survivor.'' The opener, Amerie, matches the constantly climaxing track of her radio hit ''One Thing'' with gutsy assertion. Tonight at 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $55 to $100. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000, $39.50 to $92. (Sinagra)    THE DIRTBOMBS, TRALALA (Tonight) The Detroit garage rocker Mick Collins's raw outfit, the Dirtbombs, tears through its live sets, unafraid of dissonance and rough edges. Mr. Collins has a more resonant voice than some of his shouty contemporaries. Local bubblegum rock experiment Tralala tops insistent guitar surge with lackadaisical girl-group vocals. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $15. (Sinagra)    DAVE MATTHEWS BAND, BARENAKED LADIES, BLACK EYED PEAS, JEM, MIKE DOUGHTY AND OTHERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This outdoor lineup should please anybody looking for a noodle-dance vibe without too many extended solos. Dave Matthews still traffics in everyman erotics, while the Black-Eyed Peas play cultural ambassadors to the hip-hop-deprived. The British sprite Jem writes and sings upbeat trip-pop, and the Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty spews half-baked urban poetry. Other acts include Randolph and the Family Band and Ray Lamontagne.Noon, Randall's Island Golf Center, 1 Randalls Island, (212)427-5689, $55 to $62 (tomorrow's show sold out). (Sinagra)    DURAN DURAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Still looking good in white suits after all these years, the new-wave band that gave us hits like ''Hungry Like the Wolf'' puts on a vigorous live show. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $75. Sunday at 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $75.(Sinagra)    EXTRA ACTION MARCHING BAND, OXFORD COLLAPSE, TALL FIRS, ONEIDA (Tomorrow) The anarchic San Francisco Extra Action Marching Band began as a ''procession band'' for the raucousCrash Worship. As of late, the core group, with its horns, drum corps and shimmying dancers, has played dates with David Byrne. The local trio Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic mid-American forbears like the Embarrassment. Tall Firs and Oneida also play. 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, the Lower East Side, www.eastrivermusicproject.com, free. (Sinagra)    DAVID GRAY (Tuesday) Mr. Gray's voice has a sharp, nervous quaver that keeps him sounding frayed and unpretty. He sings about tears and flames, seashores and rainy nights, strumming an acoustic guitar over his band's syncopated vamps; he owes a lot to Van Morrison. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door (sold out). (Pareles)    JIM AND JENNIE AND THE PINETOPS (Wednesday) Unlike a lot of younger alt-country bands that nod to classic traditions, this Pennsylvania group actually plays accomplished bluegrass topped by high, lonesome close-harmonic vocals. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778, $15. (Sinagra)    LAMC INDIE SHOWDOWN (Wednesday) The Latin Alternative Music Conference (www.latinalternative.com), an annual showcase for the wildly eclectic world of Latin rock, presents eight bands from the United States and points south: Pacha, Popvert, Cuban Cowboys, Orixa, Soniko, Santos de Los Angeles and Delux. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $5. (Pareles)    *LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Thursday) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 1970's Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rapping, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. 6 to 9 p.m., El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem. As part of the Latin Alternative Music Conference (www.latinalternative.com), it's a free concert. (Pareles)    MC5 (Tonight) These working-class Detroit toughs played scab-picking, drug-dabbling proto-punk rock amid the hippie era. The original members Michael Davis, Dennis Thompson and the long-winded raconteur guitarist Wayne Kramer reunite to perform their album, ''Kick Out the Jams'' (Elektra), in its uncensored entirety. The band also plays tomorrow with the Sun Ra Arkestra at Central Park SummerStage (see Sun Ra below). 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $25. (Sinagra)    O'JAYS (Monday) The O'Jays were the flagship group of the Philadelphia soul producers Gamble and Huff, dealing with hard times in songs like ''Backstabbers'' and ''For the Love of Money'' and hoping for better ones with ''Love Train.'' 7:30 p.m., Wingate Field, Winthrop Street, between Brooklyn and Kingston Avenues, Brooklyn, (718)469-1912, free. (Pareles)    OLIVIA TREMOR CONTROL (Tuesday and Wednesday) One of the bands central to the Athens, Ga., collective Elephant 6, which flourished in the mid-90's indie underground, Olivia Tremor Control melded Beatlesesque melodies and Mersey beat bounce with loopy, slacker flophouse psychedelia. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15; $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    LIZ PHAIR (Monday and Tuesday) This singer-songwriter, beloved for her early, sexy lo-fi missives, has caught flack for attempts at universal pop reach. But to her credit, her dirty-30's quirkiness shone through the slick production on her last effort. A new album, ''Somebody's Miracle'' (Capitol), is supposedly more elemental. Monday at 7 p.m. and Tuesday at 9 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8777, $25. (Sinagra)    RONNIE SPECTOR AND THE UPTOWN HORNS (Wednesday) Ronnie Spector's gutsy, fervently out-of-tune voice made ''Be My Baby'' an indelible plea and a touchstone for New York (and New Jersey) rock ever since. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, www.hudsonriverfestival.com, free. (Pareles)    SATANICIDE (Tonight) Hailing from New Jersey, this longstanding band plays a highly ironic though no doubt culturally committed version of heavy metal that bows before the alter of Black Sabbath and AC/DC. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15; $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    PATTI SMITH (Thursday) As resolutely pretentious as ever, the punk poet rocker Patti Smith still has the sinewy swagger to trump young imitators like Eleanor Friedberger of the Fiery Furnaces. Hip kids can come see the real thing howl classics like ''Gloria'' and declaim topical rants like ''Radio Baghdad.'' 7:30 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, free. (Sinagra)    RATT, QUIET RIOT, CINDERELLA, FIREHOUSE (Tomorrow) This bill includes four prominent 1980's hair metal bands. To the pop canon, Ratt contributed the vibrant and enduring ''Round and Round,'' while Quiet Riot has the distinction of writing the thuddingly irritating, yet also enduring ''Cum on Feel the Noize.'' 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $51.50. (Sinagra)    STRINGS, DEGA (Tonight) The guitar trio Strings plays a flamenco-inflected brand of Haitian troubadour music, a traditional café style featuring guitar, conga, maraca and box-like marimboula bass. Dega plays konpa, another Haitian style derived from meringue but goosed with voodoo rhythms. Midnight and 2 a.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $22 to $25. (Sinagra)    SUN-RA ARKESTRA, MC5, DJ SPOOKY (Tomorrow) The alto saxophonist Marshall Allen carries on the tradition of the legendary jazz bandleader Sun Ra, directing the ensemble of players young and old in a program that seamlessly mixes swing, skronk and squeal. The Detroit legends MC5 (see above) and the cerebral DJ Spooky also perform. 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, free. (Sinagra)    JAMES BLOOD ULMER (Thursday) The guitarist James Blood Ulmer made his name in jazz groups led by Art Blakey and Ornette Coleman, but he has deep roots in swampy, raucous blues. Singing in grizzled tones, plunking out notes with a thumb or making his guitar blurt feedback, he's in touch with both Son House and Jimi Hendrix. Noon, BAM's R&B Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles)    WHITE OUT WITH JIM O'ROURKE AND THURSTON MOORE (Tomorrow) Lin Culbertson and Tom Surgal, of the experimental group White Out, make experimental rock with analog synthesizers, autoharp, flute, drums, gongs, chains and the like. They are joined by two regular co-conspirators, the ubiquitous post-rock jack of all trades Jim O'Rourke and Thurston Moore, whose sonic youth has morphed into questing, noisy adulthood. 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501, $12. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    *BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. (Stephen Holden)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    AFRICAN BLUE NOTES (Tonight) Martin Atangana, an accomplished Cameroonian guitarist and vocalist, leads this contemporary Afro-jazz quintet. 10 and 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m., Zinc Bar, 90 West Houston Street, at LaGuardia Place, West Village, (212)477-8337; cover, $5, with a one-drink minimum. (Nate Chinen)    AMRAM & CO (Monday) The composer and multi-instrumentalist David Amram has led a profoundly diverse career in music, which he celebrates with this guest-laden evening performance. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212)989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    MICHAEL ATTIAS'S CLINAMEN SEXTET (Thursday) Taking its name from the ''atomic swerve'' concept envisioned by the Epicurean poet-philosopher Lucretius, the group Clinamen consists of improvisers attuned to the mystery of cause and effect: Mr. Attias on alto saxophone, Tony Malaby on tenor and soprano saxophones, Mark Taylor on French horn, Matt Moran on vibes, Brad Jones on bass and Tyshawn Sorey on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    *CARAMOOR JAZZ FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Aug. 6) The tenor and soprano saxophonist Joe Lovano programs jazz at the idyllic Caramoor estate, managing a fusion of contemporary vigor and historical sweep. The first of two all-day concerts pays homage to the bebop progenitors Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, the idiosyncratic musician-composers Thelonious Monk and Charles Mingus, and the percussive architect Max Roach. Mr. Lovano will also perform, alongside his fellow saxophonists David Liebman and Michael Brecker. 3 p.m., Venetian Theater at Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1252, www.caramoor.org, $45 and $55. (Chinen)    RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) ''In Flux'' (Savoy), Mr. Coltrane's fourth album, is a significant milestone; his tenor and soprano saxophone playing have never sounded more confident, and his compositions have a sleek modernistic hue. As on the CD, he fronts a stellar band: the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer E.J. Strickland. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    DEWLINE (Wednesday) This quartet honors the interdisciplinary artistry of the soprano saxophonist and composer Steve Lacy, who died last year; the players are Dave Ballou on trumpet, Kristin Norderval on vocals, Kevin Norton on vibraphone and John Lindberg on bass. 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177; cover, $8.

Allen, saxophonist; Orrin Evans, pianist; Eric Revis, bassist; and Eric McPherson, drummer. 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    JOE FARNSWORTH AND FRIENDS (Tonight and tomorrow) The light-handed yet propulsive drumming of Joe Farnsworth has made him a quiet force in the jazz mainstream; he's joined here by the percussionist Ray Mantilla, the pianist David Hazeltine and the bassist Nat Reeves. 8 and 9:45 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212)885-7119; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    *FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tuesday through Aug. 7) Curated by the progressive-minded trumpeters Dave Douglas, Roy Campbell and Jon Nelson, this six-day series, dubbed FONT, pays homage to the Art Ensemble of the Chicago instigator Lester Bowie, who died in 1999.

(Chinen)    SONNY FORTUNE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Since the 1960's, countless saxophonists have adopted the methodology of John Coltrane, but few have captured his restless spirit; Mr. Fortune, the saxophonist of choice for the Coltrane drummer Elvin Jones, is chief among them. 8 and 10 p.m. and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    FREESTYLE JAZZ FINALE (Sunday) Free-improvised music makes its last boisterous stand at CBGB's Lounge, a scruffy basement annex to the imperiled punk landmark. Roughly two dozen musicians will take part, playing in a host of combinations; among them are the guitarists Dom Minasi and Joe Morris, the saxophonists Louis Belogenis and Sabir Mateen, and the pianists Angelica Sanchez and Cooper Moore. 7 p.m., CBGB Lounge, 313 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)677-0455; cover, $10. (Chinen)    JANEK GWIZDALA BIG BAND (Tonight) Groove is what motivates this electric bass virtuoso, who hails from England; his 18-piece orchestra weds jazz voicings to a sometimes sleek, sometimes sharp contemporary sound. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen)    CHARLIE HADEN'S LAND OF THE SUN (Through Sunday) Charlie Haden won a Grammy this year for ''Land of the Sun'' (Verve), a stately homage to the Mexican composer José Sabre Marroquin. In performance, the music ranges from luminous to lugubrious; its strongest assets are the contributions of the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenon, the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby and the pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba, who also wrote most of the arrangements. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar, and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    FRED HERSCH TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Hersch, a pianist long associated with gleaming songbook interpretations, has lately focused on his own well-constructed compositions; his trio, with the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Nasheet Waits, applies a rigorous elasticity to originals and standards alike. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20 and a $10 minimum.

Opera    GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Thursday) To be counted among the country's leading summer opera festivals, it helps to have imagination and unusual repertory, and Glimmerglass offers both in spades. All four of the season's operas are now in rotation. One highlight is a new production of Benjamin Britten's wonderful and too-seldom-performed ''Death in Venice,'' directed by Tazewell Thompson and featuring William Burden. The season's other offerings are Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte,'' the French version of Donizetti's ''Lucie de Lammermoor'' and an unusual double bill consisting of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's one-acter ''La Voix Humaine,'' which depicts a woman on the phone. ''Lucie,'' tonight at 8 and Monday afternoon at 2; ''Portrait'' and ''Voix,'' tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 and Tuesday afternoon at 2; ''Così,'' tomorrow night at 8; ''Death in Venice,'' Sunday afternoon at 2 and Thursday night at 8, Alice Busch Theater, Route 80, eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607)547-2255, $31.50 to $97. (Anne Midgette)    'REGINA' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) Most people know Lillian Hellman's play ''The Little Foxes'' from William Wyler's classic 1941 film version starring Bette Davis as the ruthless matriarch of a crumbling Southern family. But in 1949 the American composer Marc Blitzstein, whose centennial is being celebrated this year, introduced his operatic version, titled ''Regina'' after the main character. With its populist score -- a deft melding of spiky contemporary harmony, jazzy bits and American vernacular music -- the opera has been gaining adherents over the years. Bard College's SummerScape series is presenting a production directed by Peter Schneider and conducted by Leon Botstein, with the fearless soprano Lauren Flanigan in the Davis role. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900, $35 to $65. (Anthony Tommasini)    Classical Music    ASTON MAGNA (Tomorrow) The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shuttled between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire foothills? The featured artist tonight is the estimable pianist Robert Levin, who doubles as musicological sleuth. Here on fortepiano, he joins the violinist Daniel Stepner and others in Beethoven's arrangement of his Fourth Piano Concerto for string quintet rather than orchestra. 5 p.m., Daniels Arts Center, Simon's Rock College, Great Barrington, Mass., (413)528-3595 or (800)875-7156, $35; in advance, $30; students and 65+, $25.

Oestreich)    BANG ON A CAN SUMMER MUSIC INSTITUTE (Tomorrow, and Monday through Thursday) Since new music tends to find more sympathetic ears in the art world than in many concert halls, Bang on a Can takes its concerts into a museum -- specifically, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, where two informal concerts a day showcase the faculty and participants of its summer learning program. The group even transplants its signature event, the marathon, in a six-hour version ranging from Wolfe to Reich to Crumb to Xenakis to Andriessen to Tenney to  you get the picture. Marathon, tomorrow afternoon at 4; other recitals, Monday through Thursday at 1:30 and 4:30 p.m., Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, Mass., (413)662-2111.

Tonight, Steven Beck, a pianist, plays Bach's Partita No. 4, Beethoven's Sonata No. 30 and Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' Mr. Beck returns on Thursday as part of a piano trio, with Mark Peskanov, a violinist, and Eric Jacobsen, a cellist, in a program that includes a world premiere by Elizabeth Adams and favorites by Mendelssohn (the D minor Trio) and Haydn (the ''Gypsy'' Trio).

This week, the early music specialist Gary Thor Wedow leads Bach's majestic Mass in B minor. 8 p.m., the Berkshire School, Route 41, Sheffield, Mass., (413)229-1999, $25 to $40. (Kozinn)    BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow, Sunday and Wednesday) The flutist Marya Martin did not want to spend summers schlepping to far-flung festivals, so she and her husband, Ken Davidson, founded a festival of their own, now in its 22nd season. Tomorrow night at 6:30, at the Atlantic Golf Club, there will be a benefit concert to support the festival, featuring Italian music. Sunday, it's Mozart and Telemann, and Wednesday, an all-French program featuring Debussy, Fauré and Duruflé.

(Eichler)    INTERNATIONAL KEYBOARD INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) This annual two-week festival, now in its seventh summer season, enters its final weekend of recitals, master classes and ceremonies. Highlights include a recital by the virtuoso pianist Marc-André Hamelin tomorrow night. He plays Schubert's Sonata in A (D. 664), Godowski's ''Nine Studies After Chopin's Études'' (which are even harder versions of Chopin's daunting works) and Liszt's dazzling operatic paraphrases of music from ''Norma,'' ''Ernani'' and ''Tristan und Isolde.'' In two concerts on Sunday you can hear in recital the finalists of the festival's competition, the Dorothy MacKenzie Awards. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Mannes College of Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212)580-0210, Ext. 4858, $20.

(Kozinn)    MOSTLY MOZART (Monday through Thursday) Mozart has gotten a new shine in New York: at least, this perennially popular Lincoln Center-based festival bearing his name has a new spring in its step, and on its program, since Louis Langrée became its music director two years ago. Certainly the festival orchestra is sounding better, as it should demonstrate in concerts during the first week of a season organized around the theme of ''Mozart's Travels,'' extending its embrace all the way to Russia, where Mozart never actually went. Mozart in Vienna is the focus on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a piece by Haydn and three by Mozart, including the Piano Concerto No. 22 with Emanuel Ax, and a concert aria with the soprano Emma Bell. Mr. Ax also offers two hourlong late-night concerts, one with Ms. Bell, in a series called ''A Little Night Music.'' Thursday is the festival debut of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, while on Monday the unquenchable Rob Kapilow analyzes ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' in his popular series ''What Makes It Great?'' Monday night at 8, Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 8, Avery Fisher Hall (orchestra); Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 10:30, Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, 10th floor (recitals); Thursday night at 8, Alice Tully Hall (Kammerphilharmonie), (212)721-6500, $25 to $58 for the orchestral concerts; $30 for the late-night recitals. (Midgette)    MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tonight through Sunday) Offering a smattering of choral music and jazz but focusing on string quartets, this venerable festival presents the Bergonzi String Quartet this weekend playing an eclectic program that ranges from Debussy's Quartet and Franck's Piano Quintet (with Melvin Chen) to Joplin and Hefty's ''Li'l Darlin'.'' Also on the weekend's program are the Silk City Barbershop Chorus from Manchester, Conn., 50 voices strong (tonight), and jazz with the vocalist Cynthia M. (tomorrow).

This weekend the Tokyo String Quartet anchors the programs. Tonight it plays works by Beethoven, Schubert and Hikaru Hayashi, and tomorrow some of its members join other performers in works by Brahms. 8 p.m., Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860)542-3000, $15 to $45; ages 18 to 25, $10; under 18, free with a paying adult.

This is a 2000 reconstruction by Pierre Lacotte of an early Petipa Egyptian fantasy. Although Sergei Filin has had to drop out of his scheduled performances as Lord Wilson, the leading role of Aspicia should be in good hands: Maria Alexandrova tonight, Svetlana Lunkina tomorrow afternoon and Svetlana Zakharova tomorrow night. Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000 or www.metopera.org; $45 to $150.

This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. 45 West 53rd Street (212)265-1040. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Glueck)    THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, are from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)    *GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 24. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith)    GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM,'  through Aug. 24. With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with a number of different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. When, at the end of the 1950's, he felt he had met his goal, Oteiza turned to Basque political and social causes. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) (Glueck)    *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)     *MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Ken Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)     NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept.18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: Uptown     *'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN' ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. Neue Gallerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, through Sept. 26. (Glueck)    Galleries: 57th Street    *'REPEAT PERFORMANCE'  More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    CHRISTIÁN SILVA: 'THE ENGLISH GARDEN' The best works by this Guadalajara-based artist are puzzling but have a visceral material presence. The trembling green rubber hands sticking out from a wall holding bunches of real parsley and coriander are especially weird. The life-size green man on the floor under a pile of vegetables is strange, too. But the big charcoal wall drawing of a drum kit is forgettable. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, (212)688-4673, through Aug. 5. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    *'BEBE LE STRANGE'  This tense, lively group show devoted to images of the figure includes strong work by a bunch of strong young artists, including Benjamin Degen, William Jones and Eileen Quinlan, and fascinating photographic work of documentary fiction by Zoe Crosher and Leslie Grant. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)352-9460, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)    *'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' The big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson, and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Aug. 19. (Cotter)      *'GREY FLAGS'  Organized by the artist Seth Price, this coolest of summer group shows puts New York art on an interesting track and looks to the future. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)680-9467, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)    'IDOLS OF PERVERSITY' Inspired by a 1980's book with the subtitle ''Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin de Siècle Culture,'' this show substitutes Surrealism for Symbolism for its prevailing mode, academic painting as its preferred style, and the contemporary art star John Currin as its patron saint. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Aug. 6. (Cotter)    DAVID LEVINTHAL: 'XXX SEX DOLLS' Mr. Levinthal is known for his provocatively ironic photographs of war toys, racist kitsch and pornographic dolls. Here, along with faux-pornographic photographs, he presents 30 female miniatures from his collection; they are kitschy marvels of sexist fetishism. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212)627-4819, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)     'LIVING FOR THE CITY' Organized by an institution-in-formation, the Brooklyn Institute of Contemporary Art, this group show has artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, some making New York debuts. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, (212)645-1701, through Aug. 5. (Cotter)    'STICKS & STONES' Images of skulls dominate this group show of mostly drawings by John White Cerasulo, Santiago Cucullu and Andrew Guenther, with an ambitious, multipart marker-on-photocopy piece by Jay Heikes. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 527 West 23rd Street, (212)627-8000, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)    *'WALLS 'N' THINGS' This show about illusion and ambiguity includes a big, tough graffiti piece lifted from Barbie packaging; wall braces that support nothing; and a wall painting that isn't there until you suddenly see it, after which it is really, really there. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 213, (212)243-3335, through Aug. 5.(Cotter)    Other Galleries    'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall, aqua-blue box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)     'DEAD KIDS DO NOTHING'  It's hard to say what this better-than-average group show adds up to, but it includes a sweetly quixotic video by Lee Walton in which he makes minor alterations to outdoor situations he encounters; another video, of a swimming mouse shot from under water by Adam Stennett, the show's organizer; lonesome modern interiors drawn in blue ink by Rebecca Chamberlain; and a dreamy, elegiac photograph of a dead pigeon shot with a pinhole camera by Jan Dunning. 31 Grand, 31 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)388-2858, through Aug. 7. (Johnson)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance     *'ATOMICA: MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE' This carefully orchestrated international group show marks the 60th anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan, on Aug. 6 and Aug. 9, 1945. Shiva Ahmadi, Ellen Levy, Nancy Spero and Hiroshi Sunairi contribute subtle work. Esso Gallery (212)560-9728, 531 West 26th Street, second floor, and Lombard-Freid Fine Arts, (212)967-8040, 531 West 26th Street, fourth floor, Chelsea, closing today. (Cotter)    'ELEVEN NGUYENS AND THE THIRTY YEAR LOSS' The independent curator Trong G. Nguyen has conceived a novel and bittersweet way to celebrate the recent anniversary of the surrender of South Vietnam to the Communist North on April 30, 1975. He has gathered together works by 11 contemporary artists who all share the name Nguyen, pronounced ''win.'' He contributes a cake with thick frosting of yellow paint and lettering that reads ''Happy Birthday War.'' PH Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)564-4480, closing today. (Johnson)    'FEAR GEAR' The best piece in this mildly political show is Maria Marshall's video ''The Emperor and His Clothes,'' in which a boy puts on and takes off absurd amounts of clothing while the soundtrack plays layered excerpts from a speech by President Bush. Also: a video of Patty Chang dancing while being splattered by paint; a knotted and suggestively dangling rubber baseball bat by Via Lewandowsky; and a mural of military clothing fragments by Jean Shin. Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)929-8180, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    *THE GENERAL'S JAMBOREE: SECOND ANNUAL WATERCOLOR EXHIBITION  Watercolor is a chronically underestimated art medium -- painting's poorer, implicitly feminine cousin. This may be one reason so many young artists have embraced it, armed with all kinds of intentions and techniques, including a few pointed at three dimensions, and also why this exhibition is, indeed, an exuberant jamboree. With the vogue for multimedia, it is also clarifying to see more than three score artists concentrating on just one. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212)625-9224, closing tomorrow. (Smith)      *'I THROW HERRING TO THE DOG'  Lillian Ludlow and Marcella Mullins, the curators of this odd and charming group show, are both clothes designers and artists, which may help explain the aesthetic of precision and improvisation that reigns here in work by Rita Ackerman, Kenneth Boyer Kloster, Sadie Laska and Patrick O'Leary, among others. Canada, 55-59 Chrystie Street, between Canal and Hester Streets, Lower East Side, (212)925-4631, closing on Sunday.(Cotter)    'IT'LL COST YOU ' In observance of the curious fact that Colonial American painters charged according to the number of human limbs visible in a picture, the collector Beth Rudin DeWoody has assembled a wildly pluralistic, often funny and kinky show of works that feature arms or legs by more than 40 artists. It ranges from a frieze of women's legs in high heels crisply painted by John Wesley to the hacked-off arm of an ape sculpted by Tony Matelli. Don't miss the tiny, finely made and well-shod wooden legs by Holly Laws in the backroom. Kathleen Cullen, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-8500, closing tomorrow. (Johnson).    'THE JEWELEIGHA SET' The works in this sharply focused yet ecumenical show of six artists inspired by fractal geometry fits together like a kind of rebus about the joy of numbers and numerousness in art, mathematics and nature. Greene Naftali Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, closing today. (Smith)    'PHILOSOPHICAL TOYS' This exceptionally interesting show introduces three ingenious people who have studied learning and cognition through toylike objects and gamelike processes: Friedrich Fröbel, the inventor of kindergarten; Shea Zellweger, who created toys for teaching his own system of logic; and Jeannine Mosely, a software engineer who explores paper folding. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212)431-5270, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    VITALY KOMAR: 'THREE-DAY WEEKEND' The work in Mr. Komar's first solo show is more personal and less zanily satirical than the art he produced with his longtime collaborator Alex Melamid, but it does involve ingenious play with political and cultural signifiers. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)226-3232, closing today. (Johnson)    MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting, in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art; and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    AERNOUT MIK: 'REFRACTION' In a plotless, silent 30-minute film, the camera slowly surveys the elaborately constructed aftermath of a bus accident on a rural highway. Though the show is well produced and absorbing to watch, you may find yourself wondering more about what it cost than about what it means. New Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222, through Sept. 10.(Johnson)     'MIRAGE' The desert and hallucination are the intertwined images here, in fine work by Jennifer Bolande, Robert Bordo, Moyra Davey, Robert Kinmont, Mary Lum, Stephan Pascher and Florian Pumhösl. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)367-7474, closing today. (Cotter)    *EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940' This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    MUSEUM AT THE FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: 'FABULOUS! FASHIONS OF THE 1940'S' through July 30. Constructed around a selection of dresses from the institute's collection, this thought-provoking exhibition briefly tells what happened when the Germans invaded Paris, forcing that city to surrender its role as leader of world fashion to New York City -- at least until the end of the war. Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212)217-7999, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    'PAINT IT WITH BLACK'  Black is the bottom line in this handsome show, organized by the artist Phong Bui, which includes enigmatic little night thoughts from Forrest Bess, Philip Guston, Bill Jensen and Thomas Nozkowski; a big one from Christopher Martin; and a rare sighting of work by the writer-curator-art historian Robert Storr. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-2772, closing today. (Cotter)    RICHARD STIPL: 'BLOC SABBATH' A dark-minded humanist and skillful sculptor, Mr. Stipl creates small, creepy, extremely realistic painted heads of grimacing men with secret-society emblems or images of famous women tattooed on their shaved skulls. An ensemble of 10 one-fourth-life-size nude men on a shelf represents a Boschian satanic ritual. Claire Oliver, 513 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)929-5949, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    *'SOMETHING IS SOMEWHERE' With art by 20 young artists, all women, this show makes an implicit feminist statement and offers art of formal variety and narrative intensity. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 504, Chelsea, (646)234-8645, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)      *'THIS SIDE TOWARD SCREEN'  With the arrival of digital imaging, slide projection became archaic technology, but as an artist's medium, it has a long and continuing history, which is touched on in new work here. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212)463-7372, closing today. (Cotter)    *'WE COULD HAVE INVITED EVERYONE' Depending on your interest, this excellent, sprawling show about the micronations and fictive states founded by artists, eccentrics, political malcontents and other subversives will either feel like the tip of the iceberg or overload. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 516A West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849, closing today.

Previews and Openings    'AMERICAN LIVING ROOM FESTIVAL' Through Aug. 21. One of the more unpredictable summer festivals presents new and multidisciplinary work. This year's theme is ''Carousel of Progress.'' Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444.    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Previews start Tuesday. Nathan Lane and Marian Seldes star in a new Terrence McNally play about a couple who want to buy a theater in upstate New York. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.    'EAST TO EDINBURGH FESTIVAL' Through July 31. A mix of Fringe-style shows that include ''A Clockwork Orange'' and ''The Booth Variations.'' 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.    'HOSPITAL' Closes Aug. 27. Axis Company's annual serial examines the inner life of a person in a coma. Every two weeks, there's a new 30-minute installment, but each works on its own. Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, off Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212)352-3101.    'LENNON' Opens Aug. 4. Latest jukebox musical (with a Yoko-approved biographical story of the beloved singer) boasts three rare and unpublished tunes to go with all your old favorites (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.    'LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL 2005' The chic-est festival of the summer puts a premium on cultural crosspollination. Among its offerings are the New York artist Robert Wilson's version of an Indonesian creation myth, ''I La Galigo''; a show about the life and work of the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen, created by Stephin Merritt, an American musician, and Chen Shi-Zheng, a Chinese director (and, incidentally, starring an Irish actress, Fiona Shaw); and the French master Ariane Mnouchkine's epic spectacle about Iranian and Kurdish refugees. Through July 31. Sites in and around Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500.     'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' Opens Aug. 3. What hath gay marriage wrought? Find out in the Five Lesbian Brothers' comic spin on Greek tragedy, which they are calling the ''feel weird lesbian tragicomedy of the year.'' (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)460-5475.    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' Previews start Wednesday. Opens Aug. 11. A musician/wedding singer gets an opportunity to sign on a major label, but that will mean leaving his bandmates behind. A musical about selling out. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'THE BLONDE IN THE THUNDERBIRD' With nary a sequin in sight, Suzanne Somers, the ex ''Three's Company'' star and perky Home Shopping Network pitchwoman, gives a guided tour of the highs and lows of her personal and professional lives. Devoted fans may savor this no-frills, quasi-intimate audience with a favorite celebrity. For all others, caveat emptor (1:35). Brooks Atkinson, 256 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Isherwood)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'  (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'PRIMO' In his crystalline adaptation of ''If This Is a Man,'' Primo Levi's memoir of the Holocaust, Antony Sher creates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of existence. His great accomplishment is in doing so in an expressly theatrical language that never sensationalizes, lectures or begs for pity (1:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)     'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS'  Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the genocide of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)     'DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE' It's called a ''reggae play,'' and the band Reggaelution is one of the best things about this story of an American woman's fling with a Jamaican musician (watched by her father and his mother). Unfortunately, an actor plays the lead musician, which blunts the impact both of the band and of this too-pat play, which goes for laugh lines at the expense of credibility. (2:30). TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444.(Anne Midgette)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)     'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)     'THE SKIN GAME' A powerful performance by James Gale propels the Mint Theater's revival of ''The Skin Game.'' The Nobel Prize laureate John Galsworthy's drama about two English families whose differences escalate into destructive conflict provides provocative and entertaining theater. (2:20) Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Van Gelder)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)    Off Off Broadway    * 'BUSTED JESUS COMIX' Based on the story of the only cartoonist ever to be tried and convicted of obscenity, this nicely performed 65-minute satire belongs to a rich dramatic tradition of turning dirty-minded artists into First Amendment heroes. David Johnston's script touches on the trial and fills out an invented biography that gives the play a satisfying arc. Access Theater , 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman)    'TOP TEN' Peter Gil-Sheridan's ''Top Ten'' is a paint-by-the-numbers series of stereotypes. The cardboard characters and predictable permutations are, in fact, actually numbered. Each vignette is presented as a sort of plot equation that never really adds up. This two-hours-plus theatrical lottery may soon make you feel in need of a remedial math course. ''Top Ten'' is even less than the sum of its parts. Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, near 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)868-4444. ( Phoebe Hoban)    15' 'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101.(Brantley)    Long-Running Shows     'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BOOCOCK'S HOUSE OF BASEBALL' Paul Boocock finds beauty in great moments from New York Yankee history, and he hates President Bush, but his attempt to merge these two preoccupations into a one-man show is as lame and listless as the 2005 Yankee pitching staff (1:00). Closes tomorrow. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101.(Genzlinger).    'THE REAL INSPECTOR HOUND' Tom Stoppard acts out nearly every playwright's occasional fantasy -- killing off a few obnoxious theater critics. Indeed, by the time this 80-minute farcical whodunit ends, the critics within the play-within-a-play have already hoisted themselves by their own verbal petards, but Mr. Stoppard -- himself a former critic -- isn't satisfied until he's totally shot them down. While the meta-twists embellishing this deliberately creaky mystery are somewhat stale after three decades, the Performers Access Studio, a troupe of professional actors with disabilities, gives a sprightly rendition of this early Stoppard confection (1:10). Closes Sunday. Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212)254-1109. (Hoban)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.     *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)    *'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)    'THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY' (R, 125 minutes, in English and Vietnamese) A young man leaves Vietnam hoping to find his father, an American soldier. Earnest and sometimes clumsy, but also affecting. (A.O. Scott)    'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director Nora Ephron forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)     'CRÓNICAS' (R, 98 minutes, in Spanish and English) John Leguizamo is an ambitious, unscrupulous Miami reporter for a tabloid television show on the track of a serial murderer of children in an Ecuadorian village. (Holden)     'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    *'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)     * 'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis)    'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be this  silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut, gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden)      'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    *'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)     'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER'  (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)      'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)     'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of the exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    *'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)      *'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring. (Scott)    * 'SARABAND' (R, 107, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden)     *'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)     ' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher, and directed by David Dobkin. (Dargis)    Film Series    AFTER VIGO (Through Thursday) When Jean Vigo died (in 1934 at age 29), he had made only one full-length feature film. This festival, which pays tribute to Vigo's work and to films directly influenced by him, concludes with Michael Almereyda's ''Another Girl, Another Planet'' (1992), which recalls Vigo's ''Atalante'' and ''Zero for Conduct,'' on Monday; Léos Carax's ''Lovers on the Bridge'' (1991) on Tuesday; and Ken Loach's ''Kes'' (1969) on Thursday.

Peter Haber plays Detective Martin Beck, and Mikael Persbrandt is his police-department partner, Gunvald Larsson, who has on-the-job problems relating to women. In ''Beck: The Ad Man,'' Detective Martin Beck (Peter Haber) and his partner investigate the death of a woman strangled with fishing line. In ''Beck: The Boy in the Glass Bowl,'' an autistic 11-year-old appears to have murdered his mother. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212)879-9779, $8.

(Through Aug. 30) This summer festival, presented by Thalia Film Classics, honors great women in classical movies, with a double feature this weekend about ladies of slightly ill repute. ''Butterfield 8'' (1960) stars Elizabeth Taylor in an Oscar-winning (if not Oscar-deserving) performance as a New York party girl who comes to a bad end. In ''Belle de Jour'' (1967), Catherine Deneuve plays a bored young newlywed who takes an afternoon job at a brothel. Both films play tomorrow and Tuesday. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400, $10. (Gates)     HISTORIC HARLEM PARKS FILM FESTIVAL (Through Thursday) This festival of free outdoor screenings continues on Wednesday night with ''Chicken Biznis'' (1998), a South African comedy about entrepreneurship.

ANITA BAKER, BABYFACE (Tomorrow) When she sings about love, as she almost always does, Anita Baker pours her lavish voice into songs that dissolve into wordless raptures. Babyface -- Kenny Edmonds -- has built a dynasty of smooth R&B, with both his own deep confections and the songs he's written and produced for the likes of Boys II Men and Mariah Carey. 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $85.(Jon Pareles)    ANTONY & THE JOHNSONS (Thursday) The transvestite warbler and outré art fixture Antony first took up the chanteuse mantle in homage to Isabella Rossellini's tragic character in ''Blue Velvet.'' His falsetto is affecting, its imperfections heightening a sense of torchy anguish. Having scaled back his band to the barest elements, he makes the most of these quavering tones. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100, $22.50 to $26.50. (Laura Sinagra)    BACKSTREET BOYS (Wednesday) This boy band's sugary yet muscular mid-90's ballads like ''I Want It That Way'' melded R&B and machine-tooled Swedish pop. They suffered some when the fresher 'NSync brought hip-hop into the mix. All grown up, they've taken to crooning vaguely spiritual anthems. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212)247-4777, $34.50 to $74.50. (Sinagra)    BORICUA FESTIVAL: EDDIE PALMIERI Y LA PERFECTA II, WILLIAM CEPEDA'S BOMBASHE, AND OTHERS (Tomorrow) The Spanish-Harlem-born pianist Eddie Palmieri's full-tilt blend of Latin rhythms and jazz dissonance has fueled a half-century-long career. The Puerto Rican trombonist Mr. Cepeda's Bombashe group mines Carribbean styles. Bimbo ''El Oso Manoso'' rides hip-hop's reggaetón wave. Other performers include the Boys Harbor Conservatory Youth Ensemble. 2 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, $3 suggested donation. (Sinagra)    COHEED AND CAMBRIA (Tonight) In a departure from the more self-referential bands in their emo cohort, Coheed and Cambria play a rough brand of metallic rock that veers into the prog preoccupation with supernatural lore and legend. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $18 (sold out). (Sinagra)    HOWIE DAY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Day is a stalwart of Boston's folksy coffeehouse scene, but now at the ripe old age of 23, his tastes have drifted closer to alt-rock, trading confessional acoustic outpourings for Radiohead-style refinement. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824, $25. (Sinagra)    THE DIRTBOMBS (Thursday) The Detroit garage rocker Mick Collins's raw outfit tears through its live sets, unafraid of dissonance and rough edges.

(Sinagra)    BUDDY GUY, SHEMEKIA COPELAND (Sunday) The Chicago blues guitarist Buddy Guy found a potent outlet when he recently joined forces with the spunky Delta preservationists at Fat Possum Records. His amused and incendiary licks at Radio City's 2003 blues summit stole the show. And at that same event, the flirty Shemakia Copeland's gravel and sass sent the concert's neo-soul stars back to diva school. 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $42.50. (Sinagra)    BEN HARPER AND THE INNOCENT CRIMINALS (Wednesday) In the 10 years since his debut, the bluesy rock guitarist Ben Harper has evolved from lone spiritual singer-songwriter to groovy globetrotting collaborator. His work last year with the Blind Boys of Alabama showcased an easy, inspired give and take. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $37.50, $40 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    GARY HIGGINS (Tomorrow) Mr. Higgins's lone album, ''Red Hash,'' from 1973, is a meandering set of dewy psychedelic folk-rock incantations. After recording it, he fell into obscurity but retained a following among free-form rockers. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501, $12. (Sinagra)    JAGUARES (Tonight) The Jaguares include former members of a leading Mexican rock band, Caifanes, and they add some alternative-rock touches to Caifanes's moody, dynamic songs. 8 p.m., B.B.

His plainspoken cleverness complicates the bombast of his star-making post 9/11 hit, ''Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.'' Ms. Womack is enshrined for the motherhood anthem ''I Hope You Dance.'' Shooter Jennings is the son of Waylon. 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $33 to $68.

(Pareles)    LIGHTNING BOLT (Tonight) Holding the microphone in his mouth, Brian Chippendale, the drummer of this Providence, R.I., noise band, hollers through electronic processors while the bassist Brian Gibson hammers on his strings till overtone squalls splice and recombine into new sonic arrangements. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501, $10. (Sinagra)    LOGGINS & MESSINA (Tomorrow and Sunday) After this seminal West Coast folk-rock duo split up in 1977, Kenny Loggins went on to fame as a footloose 80's radio hitmaker. The two now revive their songs about hazy love, watery peace and Winnie the Pooh, reprising their enduring hippie-family idyll ''Danny's Song.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $75.

(Pareles)    THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco ornamented by clang and moogy warps.

(Sinagra)    THOMAS MAPFUMO (Tomorrow) A musical pioneer with a rebel's courage, Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled government from what was Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe. The music transferred the brisk patterns of traditional thumb-piano music to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. 10 p.m. and midnight, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155, $20 to $25. (Pareles)    OZZFEST FEATURING BLACK SABBATH, IRON MAIDEN, ROB ZOMBIE, MASTADON, ETC. (Tuesday) The heavy-metal rocker (and reality TV patriarch) Ozzy Osbourne still projects a weird menace onstage with convincingly dire pronouncements over Black Sabbath's guitar sludge. This lineup also features the 1970's crypt rockers Iron Maiden, the overweaning industrial metal of Rob Zombie and the drum-heavy monster rock of Mastadon, as well as several others. 9 a.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, (732)335-0400, $50 to $125. (Sinagra)    PORTION CONTROL, CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH (Wednesday) Portion Control was fashioning scary industrial music before Skinny Puppy or Nine Inch Nails came on the scene. The Brooklyn quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah recalls the shamanic whine and thrum of mid-1990's lo-fi rockers Neutral Milk Hotel, and sometimes the slippery paranoid quirk of the Talking Heads. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15 (sold out). (Sinagra)    THE RASPBERRIES (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Raspberries were beloved for playing music that recalled the innocent harmonies of the British invasion, and they remain a touchstone for power-pop acts.

(Pareles)    PETE ROCK (Tomorrow) This hip-hop D.J. and producer's multilayered tracks for 1990's rappers and the records he released as a duo with CL Smooth exemplified the meditatively deep, jazz-inflected early-90's New York style. Tomorrow he spins a mix of hip-hop soul and funk. 10:30 p.m., Soul Sonic Sunday: Table 50, 643 Broadway, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)253-2560, $5 to $10. (Sinagra)    REGINA SPEKTOR (Wednesday) The music of this Russian-born singer and pianist (and Strokes collaborator) is of the jaggedly quirky cabaret variety. It brings punk immediacy into a chamber setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and slightly unhinged melodrama. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $25. (Sinagra)    TEENAGE FANCLUB (Tonight and tomorrow) Spin magazine spent the 1990's regretting that it chose this Scottish band's album ''Bandwagonesque'' (DGC) as 1991's best over Nirvana's debut. But these days, Teenage Fanclub's sludgy melodicism, realized through sad, dreamy guitar sprawl; spare, clever drums; and pained everyman vocals holds up just as well. Lately the band has been working with Chicago post-rock producers, incorporating electronic beeps and buzzes into its wistful power pop. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $22 to $25. (Sinagra)    TSAR (Thursday) Energized but relatively charmless ambition fuels this Los Angeles group's belated follow-up to its 2001 glam-pop debut. That record failed to make the members stars, and naming their latest ''Band, Girls, Money'' only calls attention to its pop-punk overreach. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)    THE WAIFS, JIMMIE DALE GILMORE (Tuesday) The Waifs are a young, frisky Australian band in love with older American music like folk-rock and the blues, fronted by two women who sing about trains and city life and huff up a storm on harmonica. The guitar-slung Texas troubadour Jimmie Dale Gilmore has been equating wistful Western expanse with the mysteries of existence for three decades. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, World Financial Center, 200 Liberty Street, Lower Manhattan, (212)945-2600, free. (Pareles)     M. WARD (Tonight) The echoing guitar folk-pop songs of this singer-songwriter combine heartfelt campfire zeal with the ruminative sadness of mid-tempo 1970's AM radio hits. His delicate ascents can also lilt upward into a cabaret falsetto reminiscent of Jeff Buckley's. 10 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $15. (Sinagra)    DIONNE WARWICK (Monday) With a velvety voice that holds gospel fervor in reserve, Dionne Warwick makes songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David sound easy, even with melody lines that hop all over the place and words that have to be articulated just so. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)997-4144, $68 to $75. (Pareles)    YELLOWMAN(Tuesday) More proof that Jamaican music is stranger than fiction. Yellowman is a great dance-hall reggae vocalist who also happens to be an albino. He has built his career on tongue-in-cheek sexual boasts, and although his popularity peaked about 20 years ago, he still puts on a good show, mixing wicked wit with sentimental old favorites. 11 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $18 to $22.

CANNONBALL ADDERLEY LEGACY BAND (Through Sunday) Cannonball Adderley was an alto saxophonist who balanced the harmonic precision of bebop with the homegrown grit of soul; this tribute, led by Adderley's former drummer Louis Hayes, features Vincent Herring, a worthy inheritor, on saxophone. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $20, $25 Fridays and Saturdays.(Nate Chinen)    J.D.

(Chinen)    RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Wednesday through July 30) ''In Flux'' (Savoy), Mr. Coltrane's fourth album, is a significant milestone; his tenor and soprano saxophone playing have never sounded more confident, and his compositions have a sleek, modernistic hue. As on the record, he fronts a stellar band: the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer E.J. Strickland. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    ROBERT GLASPER EXPERIMENT (Wednesday) There isn't a young musician with more buzz at the moment than Mr. Glasper, a bright and well-rounded pianist recently signed to Blue Note Records. The ''experiment'' in the title is a license to go beyond jazz-trio territory and possibly indulge serious affinities for hip-hop, house and soul. 11 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132; no cover. (Chinen)    NED GOOLD TRIO (Tomorrow) Ned Goold may be best known as a tenor saxophonist in the Harry Connick Jr. Orchestra, but he's best heard in trio, with bass and drums behind him. 8 p.m., Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212)675-7369; cover, $20.

Opera    GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Thursday) To be counted among the country's leading summer opera festivals, it helps to have imagination and unusual repertory, and Glimmerglass offers both in spades. A highlight of the season is a new production of Benjamin Britten's wonderful and too-seldom-performed ''Death in Venice,'' directed by Tazewell Thompson and featuring William Burden. Among the other offerings are Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte'' and an unusual double bill of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's ''Voix Humaine,'' another one-acter that presents a one-sided dialogue: a woman on the phone.

(Jeremy Eichler)    Classical Music    ALARM WILL SOUND (Sunday) It's hard to know exactly what to expect from this Lincoln Center Festival concert by this wildly adventurous contemporary music ensemble of voices, strings, winds and percussion. In this program, ''Unremixed,'' the ensemble ''takes on twisted techno-master Aphex Twin,'' its directors promise. Aphex Twin's electronic music will be mixed with live acoustic music for an evening of ''electronica,'' to quote the performers. This ensemble is incapable of routine. 9 p.m., the Allen Room, Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500, $28. (Anthony Tommasini)    ASTON MAGNA (Tomorrow) The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shuttled between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire foothills?

Oestreich)    BANG ON A CAN SUMMER MUSIC INSTITUTE (Tomorrow and Monday through Thursday) ''Music for Airports'' may be an appropriate piece for the summer travel season. Tomorrow the Bang on a Can All-Stars offer what they say is the first-ever live performance of that seminal Brian Eno work. Since new music tends to find more sympathetic ears in the art world than in many concert halls, Bang on a Can takes its concerts into a museum, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, where two informal concerts a day showcase the institute's faculty -- including Evan Ziporyn, who offers a clarinet recital this afternoon -- and participants. There's even a children's program tomorrow morning, with hands-on participation, called ''Kids Can Too.'' Mr. Ziporyn, today at 4:30 p.m.; children's concert, tomorrow at 11 a.m.; ''Music for Airports,'' tomorrow night at 8; recitals Monday through Thursday at 1:30 and 4:30 p.m.; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, Mass., (413)662-2111. ''Music for Airports,'' $22; other concerts are free with gallery admission, which is $10; students, $8; ages 6 to 16, $4. (Midgette)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Tonight, Hamish Milne offers a piano recital, with works by Bach, Chopin and Schubert, and tomorrow and Sunday, he is joined by Mark Peskanov, the violinist, and Jiri Barta, a cellist, for the Beethoven ''Archduke'' Trio and sonatas by Mozart and Hummel. On Thursday, it's back to solo piano: Steven Beck plays Bach, Beethoven and Mussorgsky. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083, $35; $30 for 65+ on Thursday only; students, $25. (Allan Kozinn)    BERKSHIRE CHORAL FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) For listeners who love choral music, this festival is an ideal refuge, combining the charms of the Berkshires and some of the highlights of the choral repertory, performed by a large choir of enthusiastic singers, led by renowned choral conductors. This week, Frank Nemhauser leads the choir and soloists in a hefty program that includes Dvorak's Mass in D, Stravinsky's ''Symphony of Psalms'' and John Rutter's ''Gloria.'' 8 p.m., the Berkshire School, Route 41, Sheffield, Mass., (413)229-1999, $25 to $40. (Kozinn)    BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Wednesday) The flutist Marya Martin did not want to spend summers schlepping to far-flung festivals, so she and her husband, Ken Davidson, founded a festival of their own, now in its 22nd season. Most of the concerts take place in the local Presbyterian Church, but this opening performance is a free outdoor program of works by Bach, Telemann and Torelli, performed by Ms. Martin and a group of festival regulars. 6:30 p.m., Bridgehampton Historical Society, 2368 Montauk Highway, Bridgehampton, N.Y., (631)537-3507. (Eichler)    CARAMOOR (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) The event of note this weekend at this inviting festival is a production of ''La Traviata'' tomorrow, as part of the Bel Canto at Caramoor series, conducted by Will Crutchfield and starring the soprano Georgia Jarman. Mr. Crutchfield will present a version of Verdi's beloved score that restores music usually cut in performances. ''La Traviata,'' though composed after the heyday of the Bel Canto era, is still a work beholden to that tradition, a quality Mr. Crutchfield promises to bring out in his performance. Tonight the steely-toned, formidable pianist Anton Kuerti plays works by Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms. Sunday afternoon the Emerson String Quartet offers two Mendelssohn string quartets and Brahms's stormy Piano Quintet in F minor (with Wu Han). And if you like a Romantic strain even in your contemporary music, then a program with Music From Copland House on Thursday called ''The New Romantics'' is for you. Richard Danielpour, Lowell Lieberman, John Musto and Paul Moravec, among others, have all been called, for better or worse, Neo-Romantics. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1252, $15 to $75. (Tommasini)    COOPERSTOWN CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday through Thursday) If you miss them at Tannery Pond (see below), you can see them in Cooperstown: a highlight of the week at this energetic small festival is a performance on Sunday by the St. Lawrence String Quartet of works by Haydn, Beethoven and Christos Hatzis. There is also a ''Summer Winds'' concert on Wednesday with the festival's founder, the flutist Linda Chesis, and four colleagues; and on Thursday Hopkinson Smith, a lutenist, will play 17th-century music in the drawing room of a 19th-century home. Sunday night at 7:30 at the Farmers' Museum; Wednesday night at 7:30 at Christ Episcopal Church; Thursday night at 7:30 at Hyde Hall, Cooperstown, N.Y., (877)666-7421, $25; ages 6 to 12, $12.50; lute concert, $18; ages 6 to 12, $9.

(Bernard Holland)    MAVERICK CONCERTS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This concert series near Woodstock, N.Y., now in its 90th season, offers its performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. Jason Vieaux, a young guitarist who has made some impressive recordings, is playing a rich program tomorrow, with works that range from Bach's Prelude, Fugue and Allegro and favorites by Tárrega and Albéniz to more contemporary scores, like Robert Starer's Six Preludes; he also plays a concert for young people tomorrow morning. On Sunday, the Pacifica String Quartet nestles Elliott Carter's String Quartet No. 5 between works by Schubert and Beethoven. Tomorrow at 6 p.m. (young people's concert at 11 a.m.); Sunday at 3 p.m., the Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845)679-8217, $20; students, $5. (Kozinn)    MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Offering a smattering of choral music and jazz, but focusing on string quartets, this venerable festival offers the Tang String Quartet of Singapore this weekend playing Mozart and Dvorak, then joining forces with the pianist Pamela Mia Paul for Shostakovich's Piano Quintet. Also on the weekend's program are a chorus called Dumka that performs traditional Ukrainian music in costume (tonight) and the New Black Eagle Jazz Band (tomorrow). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 3, Gordon Hall at Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860)824-7126, $25; students under 24, $12.

Wölffer Estate Vineyard in Sagaponack, N.Y., and Festival Tent, Morriss Center School, 739 Butter Lane, Bridgehampton, N.Y., (800)644-4418, $35 to $75; more for reserved seating. (Eichler)    NAUMBURG ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Sure, the New York Philharmonic gets most of the attention, but Central Park has never been a one-orchestra green space. This year is the 100th anniversary of the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, and Gregory Vajda conducts music by Stravinsky, Hindemith and Bartok, with the violist Hsin-Yun Huang joining as soloist. 7:30 p.m., Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (718)340-3018, free. (Eichler)    NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and tomorrow) Each summer the Yale Summer School of Music retreats north to this lovely spot, and the public reaps much of the benefit at concerts in the rustic Music Shed. This weekend the veteran pianist Claude Frank and the flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson anchor the programs, with works from the New World (Beach, Copland, Ginastera) and Old (Haydn, Beethoven, Schumann, Shostakovich). 8 p.m., Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860)542-3000, $15 to $45; ages 18 to 25, $10; under 18, free with a paying adult.

Lebanon Shaker Village, New Lebanon, N.Y., (888)820-9441, $23 to $28. (Midgette)    TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Wednesday) When James Levine opened his first Tanglewood season with a Mahler Eighth a couple of weeks ago, the orchestra played stunningly for him. In two programs tonight and tomorrow night, he leads his players through all four of the Brahms Symphonies. Tuesday, he returns to take part in Tanglewood on Parade, an annual shindig that features not only the Boston Symphony but also the Boston Pops and the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, in works by Berlioz, Bernstein, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven. For the occasion, Mr. Levine shares the podium with his predecessor, Seiji Ozawa, as well as John Williams, Hans Graf and Bruce Hangen. Also on the schedule, Pinchas Zukerman plays the Beethoven Violin Concerto on Sunday, with Jens Georg Bachmann conducting, and on Wednesday he leads the Zukerman Chamber Players in works by Beethoven, Mozart and Brahms. Tonight, tomorrow night, and Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 8:30; Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass, (888)266-1200, $19 to $96 Sunday through Tuesday, with lawn seats from $17 to $20; $29 to $46 on Wednesday, with $16 lawn seats. (Kozinn)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    ALL FOR LOVE (Through tomorrow) Andrew J. Nemr's choreographic love is tap, and he expresses it in a grandly scaled tap-dance event with the aid of a troupe called Cats Paying Dues. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Main Stage Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200, $30 tonight, $38 tomorrow. (Jack Anderson)    *BOLSHOI BALLET (Tonight through July 30) The Bolshoi Ballet and its opera company have been challenged of late by Valery Gergiev's Kirov operation of St. Petersburg, but they remain the big (''bolshoi'' means big) Russian brand name in the popular imagination, and recently the ballet in particular has shown signs of rejuvenation. The Bolshoi's two-week season at the Metropolitan Opera House continues tonight and tomorrow afternoon and evening with ''Spartacus,'' the ultimate showcase for muscle-flexing Soviet strongmen as righteous revolting slaves; we'll see if the current crop of Bolshoi men is as macho-athletic as their forebears. Monday through Wednesday comes ''The Bright Stream,'' a new version of a suppressed 1935 ballet about lighthearted frolics on a collective farm, with music by Shostakovich (by 1935, collective-farm ballets were supposed to be noble, not fun). Finally, on Thursday, is the beginning of four-performance, season-ending run of ''The Pharaoh's Daughter,'' a reconstruction of an early Petipa extravaganza. Tonight and tomorrow and Monday through Thursday at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 p.m. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 or www.metopera.org, $45 to $150.(John Rockwell)    EVA DEAN DANCE (Wednesday through July 31) ''Bounce'' blithely combines bouncing balls and bounding bodies. Wednesday through Saturday at 7:30 p.m., an abridged version for children will be danced Saturdays and Sundays and on Thursday at 2 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, $13 to $25. (Anderson)    DODGE DANCE COMPANY (Opens Thursday) Susan Dodge choreographically combines explosive energy with humor and musicality. Thursday through July 31, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479, $15, $12 students. (Anderson)    FLAMENCO OLÉ!

(Anderson)    *JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Aug. 3) Tonight through Sunday Garth Fagan's company will perform along with A Poc A Poc, a Barcelona-born, Mexico City-based modern-dance troupe in its United States debut. Tuesday through next Sunday the Mark Morris Dance Group will be here, celebrating its 25th anniversary, joined Thursday through next Sunday by Aszure and Artists, a troupe led by Aszure Barton. Garth Fagan at the Ted Shawn Theater, tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m., $45; $40.50 for students, seniors 65+ and children.

Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413)243-0745. (Rockwell)    JAXDANCE (Tonight and tomorrow) The title of Jaclyn Moynahan's ''What's Holding You Up?'' has a deliberate double meaning, for the work concerns both the limitations that impede us and the devices that help us cope with life's challenges. 8:30 p.m., Studio 111, 111 Conselyea Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)387-2630, $12, $10 students and 65+. (Anderson)    *LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL (Tonight through July 31) Random Dance and Shen Wei, on different nights, are sharing the New York State Theater this week, and closing out the festival's dance offerings for the summer. Tonight it's Random Dance, another of the endless flood of edgy British modern-dance troupes. Their ''AtaXia'' is billed as a ''techno-multimedia dance.'' Tomorrow and Sunday are the last two performances of the much-hailed Shen Wei Dance Arts, which has sprung onto the international dance circuit seemingly from nowhere. Random Dance tonight at 8 p.m., New York State Theater. Shen Wei tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 7 p.m., State Theater. Lincoln Center, $45, (212) 271-6500, www.lincolncenter.org.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,'  through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)      BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)    *EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,'  through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, are from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)    *GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 24. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith)    GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM,'  through Aug. 24. With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with a number of different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. When, at the end of the 1950's, he felt he had met his goal, Oteiza turned to Basque political and social causes. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) (Glueck)    *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)     *MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith)     MUSEUM AT FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: 'FABULOUS! FASHIONS OF THE 1940'S,' through July 30. Constructed around a selection of dresses from the institute's collection, this thought-provoking exhibition briefly tells what happened when the Germans invaded Paris, forcing that city to surrender its role as leader of world fashion to New York City -- at least until the end of the war. Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212)217-7999.(Ken Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)     NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)     *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    RALPH BACERRA: 'OPULENT FIRE' Beautiful and technically awe-inspiring new teapots by this Los Angeles-based ceramicist have organically shaped, multipart bodies cast from tree branches and surfaces richly glazed in fine geometric patterns. Garth Clark, 25 West 56th Street, (because of renovations of the main lobby), (212)246-2205, through Aug. 12.(Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'ALLES. IN EINER NACHT' The works on or of paper by 10 young artists from Hamburg doesn't live up to the appetite of the title (which translates as ''All. In One Night''), but it is almost invariably appealing, focused and promising. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212)414-4144, through July 29. (Smith)    *'ATOMICA: MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE' This carefully orchestrated international group show marks the 60th anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan, on Aug. 6 and Aug. 9, 1945. Shiva Ahmadi, Ellen Levy, Nancy Spero and Hiroshi Sunairi contribute subtle work. Esso Gallery (212)560-9728, 531 West 26th Street, second floor, and Lombard-Freid Fine Arts, (212)967-8040, 531 West 26th Street, fourth floor, through July 30. (Cotter)    *'BEBE LE STRANGE'  This tense, lively group show devoted to images of the figure includes strong work by a bunch of strong young artists, including Benjamin Degen, William Jones and Eileen Quinlan, and fascinating photographic work of documentary fiction by Zoe Crosher and Leslie Grant. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)     *'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' The big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson, and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Aug. 19. (Cotter)    'ELEVEN NGUYENS AND THE THIRTY YEAR LOSS' The independent curator Trong G. Nguyen has conceived a novel and bittersweet way to celebrate the recent anniversary of the surrender of South Vietnam to the Communist North on April 30, 1975. He has gathered together works by 11 contemporary artists who all share the name Nguyen, which is pronounced ''win.'' He contributes a cake with thick frosting of yellow paint and lettering that reads ''Happy Birthday War.'' PH Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, (212)564-4480, through July 29.(Johnson)      'GOOD VIBRATIONS'  Op Art lives on in works by 16 artists in this groovy show. It includes eye-buzzing paintings by Julian Stanczak; cosmic dot paintings by Barbara Takenaga; sumptuously blurry stripes by Chris Gallagher; a luminous blue grid by Susie Rosmarin, a psychedelic painting of the word ''Substance'' by Bruce Pearson and much more. McKenzie, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-5467, through July 30.(Johnson)    *'GREY FLAGS'  Organized by the artist Seth Price, this coolest of summer group shows puts New York art on an interesting track and looks to the future. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)680-9467, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)    'IDOLS OF PERVERSITY' Inspired by a 1980's book with the subtitle ''Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin de Siècle Culture,'' this show substitutes Surrealism for Symbolism for its prevailing mode, academic painting as its preferred style, and the contemporary art star John Currin as its patron saint. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Aug. 6. (Cotter)    'IT'LL COST YOU ' In observance of the curious fact that Colonial American painters charged according to the number of human limbs visible in a picture, the collector Beth Rudin DeWoody has assembled a wildly pluralistic, often funny and kinky show of works that feature arms or legs by more than 40 artists. It ranges from a frieze of woman's legs in high heels crisply painted by John Wesley to the hacked-off arm of an ape sculpted by Tony Matelli. Don't miss the tiny, finely made and well-shod wooden legs by Holly Laws in the back room. Kathleen Cullen, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 463-8500, through July 30.(Johnson).    'THE JEWELEIGHA SET' The works in this sharply focused yet ecumenical show of six artists inspired by fractal geometry fits together like a kind of rebus about the joy of numbers and numerousness in art, mathematics and nature. Greene Naftali Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770, through July 29. (Smith)     'LIVING FOR THE CITY' Organized by an institution-in-formation, the Brooklyn Institute of Contemporary Art, this group show has artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, some making New York debuts. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, (212)645-1701, through Aug. 5. (Cotter)    AERNOT MIK: 'REFRACTION' In a plotless, silent 30-minute film, the camera slowly surveys the elaborately constructed aftermath of a bus accident on a rural highway. Though the show is well produced and absorbing to watch, you may find yourself wondering more about what it cost than what it means. New Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, (212)219-1222, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    'MIRAGE' The desert and hallucination are the intertwined images here, in fine work by Jennifer Bolande, Robert Bordo, Moyra Davey, Robert Kinmont, Mary Lum, Stephan Pascher and Florian Pumhösl. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212)367-7474, through July 29. (Cotter)    *MATTHEW MONAHAN This labyrinthean cabinet of inventively recycled sculptures and drawings rifles through the combined dustbins of history, art and the artist's previous efforts to create a knockout first impression that ultimately wears a bit thin. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street, (212)367-9663, through July 29. (Smith)    *'SOMETHING IS SOMEWHERE' With art by 20 young artists, all women, this show makes an implicit feminist statement and offers art of formal variety and narrative intensity. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 504, (646)234-8645, through July 30. (Cotter)    'STICKS & STONES' Images of skulls dominate this group show of mostly drawings by John White Cerasulo, Santiago Cucullu and Andrew Guenther, with an ambitious, multipart marker-on-photocopy piece by Jay Heikes. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 527 West 23rd Street, (212)627-8000, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)    'THE SUBJECTIVE FIGURE' The infinitely malleable human body gets a workout. Highlights include Francesca Woodman's intimate photographic self-portraits; Judy Fox's life-size, extraordinarily realistic naked ceramic girl in beatific ecstasy; Nancy Davidson's sexually suggestive, aqua blue minimalist sculpture with a bra; Robert Greene's painting of two young men in a tree full of birds; and a sideshow of richly colored and blurred paintings of young girls by Leiko Ikemura. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212)366-4774, through July 29. (Johnson)    'SUMMER SUSTENANCE: A GOURMAND'S DELIGHT' This visual feast of artworks representing food includes Will Cotton's painting of a forest made of chocolate; Katherine Bradford's cartoon painting of a stack of pancakes; Mary Jo Vath's realistic watermelon; and Steve Gianakos's painting of ''Bad Mom'' putting a child into an oven. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, (212)691-6565, through July 29. (Johnson)    *'THIS SIDE TOWARD SCREEN'  With the arrival of digital imaging, slide projection became archaic technology, but as an artist's medium, it has a long and continuing history, which is touched on in new work here. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212)463-7372, through July 29. (Cotter)    *'WALLS 'N' THINGS' This show about illusion and ambiguity includes a big, tough graffiti piece lifted from Barbie packaging; wall braces that support nothing; and a wall painting that isn't there until you suddenly see it, after which it is really, really there. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 213, (212)243-3335, through Aug. 5.(Cotter)    *'WE COULD HAVE INVITED EVERYONE' Depending on your interest, this excellent, sprawling show about the micronations and fictive states founded by artists, eccentrics, political malcontents and other subversives will either feel like the tip of the iceberg or overload. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 516A West 20th Street, (212) 741-8849, through July 29. (Smith)    KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds, like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall, aqua-blue box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    *MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    ALLAN DESOUZA: 'THE LOST PICTURES'  New pictures by this conceptualist photographer meditate on the photograph as a memorial object. Mr. deSouza placed prints made from old family slides around his home, allowing them to become faded and abraded and to accumulate hair, dust and other debris. He then turned them into large, glossy digital prints in which the ghosts of the original images haunt the new, busily textured, semi-abstract surfaces. Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, at Union Square, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, through July 29. (Johnson)    *THE GENERAL'S JAMBOREE: SECOND ANNUAL WATERCOLOR EXHIBITION  Watercolor is a chronically underestimated art medium -- painting's poorer, implicitly feminine cousin. This may be one reason so many young artists have embraced it, armed with all kinds of intentions and techniques, including a few pointed at three dimensions, and also why this exhibition is, indeed, an exuberant jamboree. With the vogue for multimedia, it is also clarifying to see more than three score artists concentrating on just one. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212)625-9224, through July 30. (Smith)      *'I THROW HERRING TO THE DOG'  Lillian Ludlow and Marcella Mullins, the curators of this odd and charming group show, are both clothes-designers and artists, which may help explain the aesthetic of precision and improvisation that reigns here in work by Rita Ackerman, Kenneth Boyer Kloster, Sadie Laska and Patrick O'Leary, among others. Canada, 55-59 Chrystie Street, between Canal and Hester Streets, Lower East Side, (212)925-4631, through July 31. (Cotter)    VITALY KOMAR: 'THREE-DAY WEEKEND' The work in Mr. Komar's first solo show is more personal and less zanily satirical than the art he produced with his long-time collaborator Alex Melamid, but it does involve ingenious play with political and cultural signifiers. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)226-3232, through July 29. (Johnson)     SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    'EVERLAND' This enchanting 11-person show of fantasy landscapes assembled by the independent curator David Gibson includes the watercolorist Russell Nachman's contemporary fairy painting; Kim Keever's constructed photograph of a scary, murky yellow mountainscape; and Sandra Bermudez's photograph of orchids whose petals turn out to be tiny Vegas showgirls. Annina Nosei, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)741-8695, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    'GEE'S BEND QUILTS' Quilts made by women of the tiny hamlet of Gee's Bend, Ala., have been making the rounds of United States museums since 2002. For those who are still unacquainted with those extraordinary works of folk art, which resonate strikingly with Modernist abstraction, this small show is a good introduction. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212)445-0051, closing today. (Johnson)    'GREATER BROOKLYN' This survey of small works by 30 emerging artists selected from 400 submissions by two members of the gallery's staff presents a veritable lexicon of current trends, vigorously pursued. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)229-2766, closing today. (Smith)     'MONOCHROME IMAGE' This show of single-color works in two and three dimensions includes a man's suit, hat and shoes cast in pink rubber by David Baskin; a life-size giant squid of yellow crocheted yarn by Mary Carlson; an orange sculpture resembling a big clown's smile by John Monti; and a yellow wooden relief like a section of wainscoting by Francis Cape. Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)463-9666, closing today.(Johnson)    'NEW TAPESTRIES' Tapestry is a loosely used term for the fabric works in this show, which include a three-dimensional guitar sewn together by Margarita Cabrera; inflated columns sprouting leaves by Lee Boroson; a politically motivated chain-link fence made of woven strips by Andrea Bowers; a comically vulgar insult in needlepoint by Type A; an expansive landscape of stitched-together pieces by Rowena Dring; and much more. Sara Meltzer, 516 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-9330, closing on Wednesday. (Johnson)      CHARLES SANDISON: 'HELLO WORLD' Animated by Mr. Sandison's computer programs, projected words interact in a kind of digital ecosystem, and clouds of illuminated dots coalesce repeatedly into pairs of words that will eventually reiterate the entire text of Darwin's ''Origin of Species.'' Yvon Lambert, 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-3611, closing tomorrow.

7," Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'AMERICAN LIVING ROOM FESTIVAL' Opens Wednesday. One of the more unpredictable summer festivals presents new and multidisciplinary work. This year's theme is ''Carousel of Progress.'' Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, (212)868-4444.    'THE BLONDE IN THE THUNDERBIRD' Opens Sunday. Suzanne Somers, star of ''Three's Company,'' bares her soul in this one-woman show about her life. Be nice. (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100.    'EAST TO EDINBURGH FESTIVAL' Through July 31. A mix of fringe-style shows that include ''A Clockwork Orange'' and ''The Booth Variations.'' 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street (212)279-4200.    'LENNON' Opens Aug. 4. Latest jukebox musical (with a Yoko approved biographical story of the beloved singer) boasts three rare and unpublished tunes to go with all your old favorites (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 44th Street, (212)239-6200.    'LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL 2005' The chic-est festival of the summer puts a premium on cultural crosspollination. Among its offerings are the New York artist Robert Wilson's version of an Indonesian creation myth, ''I La Galigo''; a show about the life and work of the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen, created by Stephin Merritt, an American musician, and Chen Shi-Zheng, a Chinese director (and, incidentally, starring an Irish actress, Fiona Shaw); and the French master Ariane Mnouchkine's epic spectacle about Iranian and Kurdish refugees. Through July 31. Venues in and around Lincoln Center (212)721-6500.    'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' Previews start Wednesday. Opens August 3. What hath gay marriage wrought? Find out in the Five Lesbian Brothers's comic spin on Greek tragedy, which they are calling the ''feel weird lesbian tragicomedy of the year.'' (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street (212)460-5475.    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME'  Opens Thursday. Brian Friel's first play to receive major attention is a bittersweet comedy about a down-on-his-luck Irishman (is there any other kind in the theater?) reflecting on his life before he moves to the States (2:00) Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212)727-2737.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'  (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'PRIMO' In his crystalline adaptation of ''If This Is a Man,'' Primo Levi's memoir of the Holocaust, Antony Sher creates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of existence. His great accomplishment is in doing so in an expressly theatrical language that never sensationalizes, lectures or begs for pity (1:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)     'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS'  Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the genocide of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BOOCOCK'S HOUSE OF BASEBALL' Paul Boocock finds beauty in great moments from New York Yankee history, and he hates President Bush, but his attempt to merge these two preoccupations into a one-man show is as lame and listless as the 2005 Yankee pitching staff. (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan, (212)352-3101.(Neil Genzlinger).    * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)    'DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE' It's called a ''reggae play,'' and the band Reggaelution is one of the best things about this story of an American woman's fling with a Jamaican musician (watched by her father and his mother). Unfortunately, an actor plays the lead musician, which blunts the impact both of the band and of this too-pat play, which goes for laugh lines at the expense of credibility. (2:30). TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, garment district, (212)868-4444.(Anne Midgette)    'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)     * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)     'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Genzlinger)    'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)     'THE SKIN GAME' A powerful performance by James Gale propels the Mint Theater's revival of ''The Skin Game.'' The Nobel Prize laureate John Galsworthy's drama about two English families whose differences escalate into destructive conflict provides provocative and entertaining theater. (2:20) Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, (212)315-0231. (Van Gelder)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)    Off Off Broadway    'TOP TEN' Peter Gil-Sheridan's ''Top Ten'' is a paint-by-the-numbers series of stereotypes. The cardboard characters and predictable permutations are, in fact, actually numbered. Each vignette is presented as a sort of plot equation that never really adds up. This two-hours plus theatrical lottery may soon make you feel in need of a remedial math course. ''Top Ten'' is even less than the sum of its parts. Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, near 22nd Street, (212)868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101.(Brantley)    Long-Running Shows     'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'AS YOU LIKE IT' Thanks to Brian Bedford, the gloomy philosopher Jaques is the primary source of joy in Mark Lamos wobbly production of Shakespeare's pastoral comedy in Central Park. Whenever Mr. Bedford's Jaques is center stage, spreading skepticism among the play's spirited lovers, the sun comes out, at least in aesthetic terms. When he retreats to the fringes, clouds of mediocrity gather with alarming speed, although Lynn Collins is a warm and likable Rosalind. Delacorte Theater in Central Park. Entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West and at 79th Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)539-8750, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)     'BIRDIE BLUE'  The stern competence of Lieutenant Van Buren, the formidable figure played by S. Epatha Merkerson on ''Law & Order,'' is a long way from the warm but addled Birdie Blue, the title character in the new play by Cheryl L. West at the Second Stage Theater. The gifted Ms. Merkerson has no trouble bridging that emotional distance, but there's little she can do to patch the dramatic holes in Ms. West's fragmentary, seriously unsatisfactory play. (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422, closes Sunday. (Isherwood)    *'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Can man-shark love survive in the post- ''Jaws'' era? Adam Bock's screwy, perfectly cast play poses this and other questions you didn't know needed asking, in hilarious fashion. (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422, closes Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)     *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)    *'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)    'THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY' (R, 125 minutes, in English and Vietnamese) A young man leaves Vietnam hoping to find his father, an American soldier. Earnest and sometimes clumsy, but also affecting. (A.O. Scott)    'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director Nora Ephron forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRÓNICAS' (R, 98 minutes, in Spanish and English) John Leguizamo is an ambitious, unscrupulous Miami reporter for a tabloid television show on the track of a serial murderer of children in an Ecuadorian village. (Holden)    'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis)    'A DECENT FACTORY' (No rating, 79 minutes, in English, Finnish and Chinese) A cursory, irritatingly facile look at the human cost of globalization, this documentary film was shot and directed by a Frenchman, Thomas Balmès, who tagged along with representatives of the Finnish cellphone giant Nokia on a trip to one of the company's suppliers in China. (Dargis)     *'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM'  (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    'THE FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    '5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)    *'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)    'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be THIS silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    *'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)    'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER'  (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'LILA SAYS' (No rating, 89 minutes, in French) Ziad Douieri's film, about a 16-year-old French girl's provocative verbal seduction of a 19-year-old Arab boy takes the raw material of social realist melodrama and turns it into a sad and sexy pop song. (Scott)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    'MODIGLIANI' (R, 128 minutes) In every particular, the screen biography of the Italian painter and sculptor offers a case study of how not to film the life of a famous artist. Andy Garcia's wooden lead performance leads its list of the movie's sins against art history. (Holden)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of the exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    *'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)      *'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring (Scott)    * 'SARABAND' (R, 107, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage,'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)    *'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'STEVE + SKY' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Flemish Dutch) The feature film debut of the 26-year-old Flemish filmmaker Felix van Groeningen, ''Steve + Sky'' is the story of how Steve (Titus de Voogdt), a scruffy small-time hoodlum just released from jail, falls for Sky (Delfine Bafort), a naïve young prostitute trying to get out of the life. With its deliberately washed-out color palette, affectless dialogue and nearly event-free storyline, ''Steve + Sky'' is a mere slip of a movie, a wan character study of people who add up to little more than a series of studied quirks. (Stevens)    *'TROPICAL MALADY' (No rating, 118 minutes, in Thai) Perched between two worlds, two consciousnesses and two radically different storytelling traditions, this Thai feature shows the young filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul pushing at the limits of cinematic narrative with grace and a certain amount of puckish willfulness. (Dargis)      'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    * 'THE WORLD' (No rating, 133 minutes, in Mandarin) Globalization and its discontents form the molten core of ''The World,'' Jia Zhangke's fictionalized look at life inside a Disney-like entertainment park in China. This quietly despairing vision comes equipped with an ethnographic attention to detail, glints of surreal comedy and a scaled-down replica of the twin towers. (Dargis)  Film Series    AFTER VIGO (through July 28) When Jean Vigo died (in 1934 at age 29), he had made only one full-length feature film. This festival pays tribute to Vigo's work and to films directly influenced by him, including Frederick Wiseman's ''High School'' (1968), considered a parallel to ''Zero in Conduct,'' on Monday; and ''Á Propos de Nice, la Suite'' (1995), a compendium of shorts, on Tuesday.

The American-Scandinavian Foundation is screening four more of these made-for-Swedish-television movies on consecutive Wednesdays. Peter Haber plays Detective Martin Beck and Mikael Persbrandt is his police-department partner, Gunvald Larsson, who has on-the-job problems relating to women. In ''Beck: The Recluse,'' they investigate the deaths of an elderly man on the island of Vanso and a young woman in Stockholm. In ''Beck: Sender Unknown,'' the victim is an accountant booked on a flight to Malaysia. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212)879-9779. $8.

JUAN ATKINS (Tomorrow) This electronic-music pioneer is enjoying an unexpected run on the pop charts thanks to Missy Elliott, whose hit single ""Lose Control"" is based on ""Clear,"" the 1982 track by Mr. Atkins's old duo, Cybotron. He is to play a D.J. set at this afternoon's dance party; expect a wide-ranging journey, anchored by a hard, sharp pulse. 3 p.m., P.S. 1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084, $8. (Kelefa Sanneh)    BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY (Tonight) The mid-90's neo-swing movement was good to this sax-based group, which had less charm than the Squirrel Nut Zippers but has continued to tour the lounge and ballroom circuit. 8 and 10 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $25.(Laura Sinagra)    COHEED & CAMBRIA, PANTHERS (Thursday) Coheed and Cambria play a rough brand of metallic rock that veers into the prog preoccupation with supernatural lore and legend. The Brooklyn punkers the Panthers make incendiary music conscious of both the avant-garde and grass-roots politics. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $18. (Sinagra)    ELVIS COSTELLO & THE IMPOSTERS, EMMYLOU HARRIS (Tuesday) For all his collaborating and genre-splicing, Elvis Costello burns brightest with his tautly ferocious rock band. Country rock's Ms. Harris continues to contemplate love and loss with trademark ghostly tenderness, 6 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)360-2777, $57.50, $60 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    THE DONNAS (Thursday) The brash charm of these rockers has always teetered between been fabulous and pre-fabricated. But any fiesty put-ons fall away when the guitarist Donna R lays into her three-chord Ramones riffs and more recent arena rock solos with single-minded verve. 6:30 p.m., Pier 54, Hudson River Park, at 13th Street, free. (Sinagra)     FAITH EVANS (Tomorrow)Biggie Smalls's widow seems to be finally emerging as her own creative self. Her touted soul power has seemed diffuse in the past, but this survivor's latest material plays on her natural warmth rather than her dancefloor exhortations. 11:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $35. (Sinagra)    FEMI KUTI, BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Sunday) Femi Kuti plays a less confrontational but no less propulsive version of the Afro-beat invented by his father, Fela Anikulapo Kuti. It's burly Nigerian funk with bruising horn riffs, jazzy solos, dancing backup singers and lyrics that mix seriousness and sensuality within the groove. Openers Brazilian Girls play erotic, electronica-inflected reggae and bossa novas. 3 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street at Fifth Avenue,(212)360-2777, free. (Pareles)    HIDDEN CAMERAS, DRESSY BESSY, PONY DA LOOK (Tonight) The Canadian collective Hidden Cameras, one of the first and best in the current wave, brings to its pop a unified drive less fretful than the anthemic country folk of its compatriots Arcade Fire. An intentionally chaotic live show coheres without seeming cultish or hinging on the frisson of collapse. Dressy Bessy's sassy bounce harkens back to gutsy, melodic alt-punk. Pony Da Look plays a bluesier version of the same. 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancy Street, (212)260-4700, $15, $17 at the door.. (Sinagra)    FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tuesday) Freedy Johnston's finely turned country-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor.

The soprano Deborah Voigt is an acclaimed Sieglinde, so the audience will know what it's in for with Act I of ''Die Walküre.'' But Ms. Voigt takes another step toward adding the role of Brünnhilde to her repertory in the concert's second half, a concert performance of the final act of ''Götterdämmerung.'' On Sunday afternoon Mr. Levine and the pianist Peter Serkin have another go at Charles Wuorinen's Piano Concerto No. 4, a work they gave the premiere of this past season. The eclectic and interesting program includes works by John Harbison, Varèse and Gershwin. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30, Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200, $19 to $85; $17 for lawn seats. (Tommasini)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    *BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. (Stephen Holden)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    *AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight through tomorrow) The company's annual Metropolitan Opera House season comes to an end this weekend with three final performances of ''Giselle.'' Julie Kent dances the title role tonight and tomorrow night, with Xiomara Reyes tomorrow afternoon. Julio Bocca is Ms. Kent's partner tonight, with Veronika Part as Myrta. Jose Manuel Carreño is Albrecht tomorrow night, with Michele Wiles. Angel Corella dances opposite Ms. Reyes, with Carmen Corella. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., tomorrow at 2 p.m. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000 or www.abt.org, $22 to $130. (John Rockwell)    ARTICHOKE DANCE COMPANY (Thursday through Sunday) Lynn Neuman's ''Look at Me (when I talk to you),'' a new work about moments that precipitate action or change, shares a program with the circuslike ''Origins.'' 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479 $20, $10 students, 65+ and dancers. (Jack Anderson)    *BOLSHOI BALLET (Monday through July 30) Both the Bolshoi Ballet and its opera companies have been challenged of late by St. Petersburg's Kirov operation, but this remains the big (''bolshoi'' means big) Russian troupe in the popular imagination, and recently the ballet in particular has shown signs of rejuvenation. Monday marks its return to the Metropolitan Opera House after an 18-year absence (the company was at the New York State Theater in 1990 and 2000). The Bolshoi is offering four evening-length works, mostly fresh and unusual and all interesting as showcases for dancers. Monday through Thursday comes the opening salvo in the form of Petipa's comic ''Don Quixote,'' the same ballet that opened American Ballet Theater's Met season eight weeks before. (The rest of the repertory consists of that Soviet show horse ''Spartacus''; the new artistic director Alexei Ratmansky's ''Bright Stream,'' to music of Shostakovich; and a Petipa revival, ''The Pharaoh's Daughter.'') In ''Don Quixote,'' Svetlana Zakharova dances Kitri on Monday and returns on Thursday, both times partnered by Andrei Uvarov as Basil. On Tuesday it's Maria Alexandrova and Sergei Filin, and on Wednesday, Galina Stephanenko and Yuri Klevtsov. Monday through Thursday at 8 p.m. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000 or www.metopera.org, $45 to $150. (Rockwell)    EVA DEAN DANCE (Wednesday through July 31) ''Bounce'' blithely combines bouncing balls and bounding bodies. Wednesday through Saturday at 7:30 p.m., an abridged version for children will be danced Saturdays and Sundays and July 27 at 2 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, (212) 924-0077 $13 to $25.(Anderson)    IMAGO DANCE THEATER (Opens Thursday) ''Stress Addicted Nation'' romps through the overscheduled lives of stressaholics. Thursday through July 24 at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479, $20, $15 students, 65+ and dancers. (Anderson)    JAXDANCE (Through July 23) The title of Jaclyn Moynahan's ''What's Holding You Up?'' has a deliberate double meaning, for the work concerns both the limitations that impede us and the devices that help us cope with life's challenges. Thursday through July 23 at 8:30, Studio 111, 111 Conselyea Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)387-2630, $12, $10 students and 65+. (Anderson)    *LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL (Tonight through July 31) Tonight and tomorrow night are the last two performances of Merce Cunningham's magisterial, rarely seen ''Ocean,'' at Jazz at Lincoln Center's new Rose Theater. The festival's dance offerings continue on Monday with the first of three performances in the intimate Clark Studio Theater of Mugiyono Kasido, an Indonesian dancer-choreographer billed as an event related to Robert Wilson's Indonesian theater epic ''I La Galigo.'' Tuesday (and July 23 and 24) at the New York State Theater will be the much-hailed Shen Wei Dance Arts, which has sprung onto the international dance circuit seemingly from nowhere. In between, also at the State Theater, comes Random Dance, another of the endless flood of edgy British modern-dance troupes. Its ''AtaXia'' is billed as a ''techno-multimedia dance.'' Cunningham tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th and Broadway, $35 to $70. Kasido Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Clark Studio Theater, Rose Building, Lincoln Center, $35. Shen Wei Tuesday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, $45. Random Dance Thursday and next Friday at 8 p.m., State Theater, $45. (212)271-6500, www.lincolncenter.org. (Rockwell)    TERE O'CONNOR (Tonight and tomorrow) Don't be fooled by the title. Everything's fluid in ''Frozen Mommy,'' a study in evocative shifts of situation and characterization. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org $20, $12, students, 65+ and D.T.W. members (Anderson).    *JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Aug. 3) Tonight through Sunday Alonza King's Lines Ballet from San Francisco will alternate with the modern-dance choregrapher Ben Munisteri. Wednesday through next Sunday Garth Fagan will be here, joined Thursday through next Sunday by A Poc a Poc, a Barcelona-born, Mexico City-based modern-dance troupe in its United States debut. Lines at the Ted Shawn Theater, tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m. $50; $45 for students, 65+ and children. Munisteri at the Doris Duke Studio Theater, tonight and tomorrow at 8:15 p.m., tomorrow at 2:15 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m. $20; $18 for students, seniors and children. Fagan at the Shawn Theater Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. $45; $40.50 for students, 65+ and children. A Poc a Poc at the Duke Theater, Thursday at 8:15. $20; $18 for students, 65+ and children. Details of the week's free performances and exhibitions can be found on www.jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413)243-0745. (Rockwell)    RED WALL DANCE THEATER (Through Sunday) A company of six women presents works that integrate dance and theater to comment on the bizarre twists of human experience. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 7 and 9 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Far Space, 521 West 26th Street, (718)781-1785 $10. (Anderson)    SITELINES: TOM PEARSON (Today and tomorrow) ''Reel'' choreographically uses the rotunda of a former United States Customs House to comment on themes of dominance and reconciliation. 2 p.m., Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3888. free.(Anderson)    SOUTH PLEASANT COMPANY (Tuesday) Cristina Septien's ''To One I Saw Small'' tells the story of a disenchanted spelling-bee champion with the aid of movement, dialogue and video. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Ars Nova Theater, 511 West 54th Street, Midtown, (212)352-7112, $15. (Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums     *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,'  through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs, by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000.(Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)     THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)     *GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 24. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith)    GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM,'  through Aug. 24. With the goal of paring sculpture down to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's creating the right containers. Experimenting with a number of different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. When at the end of the 1950's he felt he had met his goal, Oteiza turned to Basque political and social causes. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) (Glueck)    *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The Dauguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    *MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,'  through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    MUSEUM AT FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: 'FABULOUS! FASHIONS OF THE 1940'S,' through July 30. Constructed around a selection of dresses from the institute's collection, this thought-provoking exhibition briefly tells what happened when the Germans invaded Paris, forcing that city to surrender its role as leader of world fashion to New York City -- at least until the end of the war. Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 217-7999.(Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)     NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)     *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavanger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 60's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    RALPH BACERRA: 'OPULENT FIRE' Beautiful and technically awe-inspiring new teapots by this Los Angeles-based ceramicist have organically shaped, multi-part bodies cast from tree branches and surfaces richly glazed in fine geometric patterns. Garth Clark, 25 West 56th Street, (due to renovations of the main lobby), (212)246-2205, through Aug. 12.(Johnson)    7/15 'GEE'S BEND QUILTS' Quilt's made by women of the tiny hamlet of Gee's Bend, Ala., have been making the rounds of United States museums since 2002. For those who are still unacquainted with those extraordinary works of folk art that resonate strikingly with Modernist abstraction, this small show is a good introduction. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through July 22.(Johnson)    ELIZABETH HEYERT: 'THE TRAVELERS' A touching show of 31 nearly life-size portraits of black people, dressed to the nines but with their eyes closed. They are dead, it turns out, and lying in their coffins. The set and costume designer for their opulent repose is a Harlem mortician named Isaiah Owens, who upholds a fading custom still observed by some blacks, of paying respect to the dead by seeing them off in sartorial splendor. Photographing them, Ms. Heyert came to believe that the portraits were not about death but about people's lives and their sharing of ''family, faith, traditions.'' Once you get over the startle factor, you can appreciate the elegance and restraint of her response to Mr. Owens's vision. Edwynn Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street, (212)750-7070, through July 23. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    AMBREEN BUTT: 'I NEED A HERO' With flair, wit and uncommon craftsmanship, Ms. Butt, a Muslim born in Pakistan but now living in the United States, revives the exquisitely detailed art of Persian and Indian miniature painting to explore modern issues like self-identity, clashes of cultural values, battles of the sexes and other knotty matters. Her stalwart protagonists take the form of a youngish woman and her clones dressed in casual western clothes, who have at on old-fashioned allegorical symbols like demons, dragons and such. Her work is a pungent addition to that of the growing group of artists here who grapple with bicultural identities. Kustera Tilton Gallery, 520 West 21st Street, (212)989-0082. through July 29. (Glueck)    'ELEVEN NGUYENS AND THE THIRTY YEAR LOSS' The independent curator Trong G. Nguyen has conceived a novel and bittersweet way to celebrate the recent anniversary of the surrender of South Vietnam to the communist North on April 30, 1975. He has gathered together works by 11 contemporary artists who all share the name Nguyen, which is pronounced ''win.'' He contributes a cake with thick frosting of yellow paint and lettering that reads ''Happy Birthday War.'' PH Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, (212)564-4480, through July 29.(Johnson)    'EVERLAND' This enchanting, 11-person show of fantasy landscapes assembled by independent curator David Gibson includes the watercolorist Russell Nachman's contemporary fairy painting; Ruth Waldman's delicately drawn web of mutant organs; confectionery table-top sculptures by Linda Ganjian, Kim Keever's constructed photograph of a scary, murky yellow mountainscape; and Sandra Bermudez's photograph of orchids whose petals turn out to be tiny Vegas showgirls. Annina Nosei, 530 West 22nd Street, (212)741-8695, through July 23. (Johnson)    'FEAR GEAR' The best piece in this mildly political show is Maria Marshall's video ''The Emperor and His Clothes'' in which a boy puts on and takes off absurd amounts of clothing while the soundtrack plays layered excerpts from a speech by President Bush. Also: a video of Patty Chang dancing while being splattered by paint; a knotted and suggestively dangling rubber baseball bat by Via Lewandowsky; and a mural of military clothing fragments by Jean Shin. Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, (212)929-8180, through July 30 (Johnson)     'GOOD VIBRATIONS'  Op Art lives on in works by 16 artists in this groovy show. It includes eye-buzzing paintings by Julian Stanczak; cosmic dot paintings by Barbara Takenaga; sumptuously blurry stripes by Chris Gallagher; a luminous blue grid by Susie Rosmarin, a psychedelic painting of the word ''Substance'' by Bruce Pearson and much more. McKenzie, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212)989-5467, through July 30.(Johnson)    'GREATER BROOKLYN' This survey of small works by 30 emerging artists selected from 400 submissions by two members of the gallery's staff presents a veritable lexicon of current trends, vigorously pursued. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766 (through July 22) (Smith).     'HOMOMUSEUM: HEROES AND MONUMENTS' With multiculturalist monuments to all kinds of minorities in place, how about a National Gay Hall of Fame, celebrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered culture? This group show of 27 artists could have been sharper and more exploratory than it is, but has good work and packs a lot of history. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 30. (Cotter)    *LIU ZHENG: 'THE CHINESE' Under the influence of Sander, Frank and Arbus, this Chinese photographer set out to document his own society with a focus on the dark and wild side. His pictures of miners, prisoners, strippers, transsexuals, hospital patients and corpses have an almost surrealistic intensity. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212)414-0370, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)    *MATTHEW MONAHAN This labyrinthean cabinet of inventively recycled sculptures and drawings rifles through the combined dustbins of history, art and the artist's previous efforts to create a knockout first impression that ultimately wears a bit thin. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street, (212)367-9663, through July 29. (Smith)    'MONOCHROME IMAGE' This show of single-color works in two and three dimensions include a man's suit, hat and shoes cast in pink rubber by David Baskin; a life-size giant squid of yellow crocheted yarn by Mary Carlson; an orange sculpture resembling a big clown's smile by John Monti; and a yellow wooden relief like a section of wainscoting by Francis Cape. Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212)463-9666, through July 22. (Johnson)    NICK PAYNE AND DON PORCELLA In Mr. Porcella's comical paintings, images like Sasquatch lounging in a pink recliner by a wilderness lake and a mobile home trailer on fire are embodied in a thick, sensuously waxy medium. Mr. Payne constructs humorously primitive illustrations of probably apocryphal historical events out of colored pipe cleaners. Planaria, 525 West 23rd Street, (212)645-2100, through July 23. (Johnson)    RICHARD STIPL: 'BLOC SABBATH' A dark minded humanist and skillful sculptor, Mr. Stipl creates small, creepy, extremely realistic, painted heads of grimacing men with secret society emblems or images of famous women tattooed on their shaved skulls. An ensemble of 10 one-fourth-life-size nude men on a shelf represents a Boschian satanic ritual. Claire Oliver, 513 West 26th Street, (212)929-5949, through July 23. (Johnson)    'SUMMER SUSTENANCE: A GOURMAND'S DELIGHT' This visual feast of artworks representing food includes Will Cotton's painting of a forest made of chocolate; Katherine Bradford's cartoon painting of a stack of pancakes; Mary Jo Vath's realistic watermelon; a vomit-scape by Cindy Sherman; letters spelling ''Nice Hot Vegetables'' by Ed Ruscha; a 1958 drawing of grapes on the vine by Andy Warhol; a 1932 commercial photograph of eggs and an egg slicer by Ansel Adams; and Steve Gianakos's painting of ''Bad Mom'' putting a child into an oven. Edward Thorpe, 210 11th Avenue, (212)691-6565, through July 29.(Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall, aqua-blue box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    ALLAN DESOUZA: 'THE LOST PICTURES'  New pictures by this conceptualist photographer meditate on the photograph as a memorial object. Mr. deSouza placed prints made from old family slides around his home, allowing them to become faded and abraded and to accumulate hair, dust and other debris. He then turned them into large, glossy digital prints in which the ghosts of the original images haunt the new, busily textured, semi-abstract surfaces. Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, Union Square, (212) 673-3096, through July 29. (Johnson)    *THE GENERAL'S JAMBOREE: SECOND ANNUAL WATERCOLOR EXHIBITION  Watercolor is a chronically underestimated art medium -- painting's poorer, implicitly feminine cousin. This may be one reason so many young artists have embraced it, armed with all kinds of intentions and techniques, including a few pointed at three dimensions, and also why this exhibition is, indeed, an exuberant jamboree. With the vogue for multi-media, it is also clarifying to see more than three score artists concentrating on just one. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street at Grand Street, SoHo, (212)625-9224, through July 30. (Smith)    VITALY KOMAR: 'THREE-DAY WEEKEND' The work in Mr. Komar's first solo show is more personal and less zanily satirical than the art he produced with his long-time collaborator Alex Melamid, but it does involve ingenious play with political and cultural signifiers. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)226-3232, through July 29. (Johnson)    MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    EXCEEDING PAINT/EXPANDING PAINTING' In conceptual or formal ways, 14 artists subvert traditional painting. Approaches range from mildly rebellious -- as in Arturo Herrera's fusion of Abstract Expressionism and Disneyesque cartooning painted on the wall -- to mildly offensive, as in Philippe Meste's semen-splattered mirror. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    'JOAN MITCHELL SKETCHBOOK: 1949-51' The 60 pages from a single notebook document an eventful period in this American painter's life, years that saw her moving between New York and Paris, and changing from a figurative to an abstract painter, consolidating a connection to French modernism, particularly to Cézanne and early Mondrian; and absorbing the spirit of the New York painters she felt closest to, Willem De Kooning, Arshile Gorky. Francis M. Naumann, 22 East 80th Street, Upper East Side, (212)472-6800, closing today.(Cotter)    * MOMUS AND MAI UEDA: 'I'LL SPEAK, YOU SING' From 1 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, Momus, the Scottish-born alternative-music legend, makes up stories, while Ms. Ueda, a Japanese performance artist, sings, comments and moves about.

Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'THE BLONDE IN THE THUNDERBIRD' Previews start today. Opens July 17. Suzanne Somers, star of ''Three's Company,'' bares her soul in this one-woman show about her life. Be nice. (1:35). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100.    'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' Opens Sunday. Former Goony Corey Feldman has bunny problems in this adaptation of the 80's thriller (1:10) East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street (212)279-4200.    'LENNON' Opens Aug. 4. Latest jukebox musical (with a Yoko approved biographical story of the beloved singer) boasts three rare and unpublished tunes to go with all your old favorites (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 44th Street, (212)239-6200.    'LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL 2005' The chic-est festival of the summer puts a premium on cultural crosspollination. Among its offerings are the New York artist Robert Wilson's version of an Indonesian creation myth, ''I La Galigo''; a show about the life and work of the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen, created by Stephin Merritt, an American musician, and Chen Shi-Zheng, a Chinese director (and, incidentally, starring an Irish actress, Fiona Shaw); and the French master Ariane Mnouchkine's epic spectacle about Iranian and Kurdish refugees. July 12-July 31. Venues in and around Lincoln Center (212)721-6500.    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME' Previews start Thursday. Opens July 21. Brian Friel's first play to receive major attention is a bittersweet comedy about a down-on-his-luck Irishman (is there any other kind in the theater?) reflecting on his life before he moves to the States (2:00) Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212)727-2737.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'  (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)        'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS'  Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the genocide of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BIG TIMES' Did you hear the one about the three actresses who wrote themselves a play? The punchline is this sweet, slender homage to the glory days of vaudeville, complete with goofy jokes, gags and good music by the Moonlighters: kids are as likely to enjoy it as adults. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    'BOOCOCK'S HOUSE OF BASEBALL' Paul Boocock finds beauty in great moments from New York Yankee history, and he hates President Bush, but his attempt to merge these two preoccupations into a one-man show is as lame and listless as the 2005 Yankee pitching staff. (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan, (212)352-3101.(Neil Genzlinger).    * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)    'DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE' It's called a ''reggae play,'' and the band Reggaelution is one of the best things about this story of an American woman's fling with a Jamaican musician (watched by her father and his mother). Unfortunately, an actor plays the lead musician, which blunts the impact both of the band and of this too-pat play, which goes for laugh lines at the expense of credibility. (2:30). TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, garment district, (212)868-4444. (Midgette)    'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'BIRDIE BLUE'  The stern competence of Lieutenant Van Buren, the formidable figure played by S. Epatha Merkerson on ''Law & Order,'' is a long way from the warm but addled Birdie Blue, the title character in the new play by Cheryl L. West at the Second Stage Theater. The gifted Ms. Merkerson has no trouble bridging that emotional distance, but there's little she can do to patch the dramatic holes in Ms. West's fragmentary, seriously unsatisfactory play (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)     * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)     'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Genzlinger)     'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)     *'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Can man-shark love survive in the post- ''Jaws'' era? Adam Bock's screwy, perfectly cast play poses this and other questions you didn't know needed asking, in hilarious fashion (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)    Off Off Broadway    'THE HOLLOW MEN' The four-member British comedy troupe Hollow Men is generous to a fault. At the Village Theater, the generosity is manifest in the high number of brief skits flowing through the roughly 90-minute, two-act show. The fault is that while the performers are expressive, their comedy routines are short on high humor, and as food for thought, their bleak slices of life don't provide enough of a Munch. (1:45) Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village; (212)253-2164. (Van Gelder)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101.(Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00).

Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Gates)     'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    Last Chance    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' When the eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent trial of the century -- the first of many in the 20th -- was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' recounts the sensational events with nuance and admirable research, but the passionless production unfortunately has the whiff of the whiff of Masterpiece Theater (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)     'PINEAPPLE & HENRY' Linda Segal Crawley's says if only walls could speak. What they have to say is that people don't always get what they want. That perception lacks novelty, and so does the play, directed by Scott C. Sickles. Though never less than watchable, it is mostly unremarkable in characters, situations and language (1:50). Workshop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, (212)695-4173, ext. 5, closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)    'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Éloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Van Gelder)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)    'ALMOST BROTHERS' (No rating, 103 minutes, in Portuguese) Recent Brazilian history and class warfare are the interwoven themes of this powerful but confusingly edited story of the embattled friendship between a white middle-class political activist and a black slum dweller who becomes a drug lord.(Stephen Holden)    *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)    *'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)    'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director Nora Ephron forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Holden)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH'  (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)    'DALLAS 362' (R, 100 minutes) The directorial debut of Scott Caan, the 28-year-old son of the actor James Caan, ''Dallas 362'' tracks the troubled friendship between Rusty (Shawn Hatosy) and Dallas (Mr. Caan), two boys just out of their teens whose lives have become stalled in an endless cycle of drinking, bar brawls and minor arrests. ''It's a whole thing'' is this film's catchphrase, a line the two boys use to gesture inarticulately toward the complexity of any subject they can't understand. Scott Caan's debut film is not quite yet a whole thing, but it offers up enough interesting fragments to make his sophomore effort worth watching for. (Stevens)    'A DECENT FACTORY' (No rating, 79 minutes, in English, Finnish and Chinese) A cursory, irritatingly facile look at the human cost of globalization, this documentary film was shot and directed by a Frenchman, Thomas Balmès, who tagged along with representatives of the Finnish cellphone giant Nokia on a trip to one of the company's suppliers in China. (Dargis)    *'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM'  (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    '5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)    *'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)    'HEIGHTS' (R, 93 minutes) In its aspirations, design and worldview, ''Heights'' resembles a number of other films about cozily connected souls, a soap-operatic subgenre that might be called We Are the World. Everybody hurts, as Michael Stipe likes to sing, but people in ''Heights'' seem to hurt more or at least spend a lot of time nursing that hurt in brooding silence and noisy confrontation. (Dargis)    'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be THIS silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    *'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER'  (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER'  (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'LILA SAYS' (No rating, 89 minutes, in French) Ziad Douieri's film, about a 16-year-old French girl's provocative verbal seduction of a 19-year-old Arab boy takes the raw material of social realist melodrama and turns it into a sad and sexy pop song. (Scott)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    'MODIGLIANI' (R, 128 minutes) In every particular, the screen biography of the Italian painter and sculptor offers a case study of how not to film the life of a famous artist. Andy Garcia's wooden lead performance leads its list of the movie's sins against art history. (Holden)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    *'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'REBOUND' (PG, 97 minutes) In the tepid family comedy, Martin Lawrence is a disgraced college basketball coach who finds humility and community values while coaching a team of junior high school geeks. Ick is the word. (Holden)    *'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring (Scott)    'SEX, POLITICS AND COCKTAILS' (No rating, 90 minutes) In this debut feature written, directed and edited by Julien Hernandez , Sebastian Cortez (played by Mr. Hernandez) is a 31-year-old Cuban-American filmmaker who finds work making a series of documentaries about gay culture, Sebastian asks his friend Daria (Marisa Petroro), a soap-opera actress, to introduce him to her circle of gay friends, a raucous group given to margarita-swilling and trading raunchy stories. The common theme of these scattered vignettes seems to be that, straight or gay, it's tough to find love and commitment in a world filled with venal, grasping nitwits. (Stevens)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)    *'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    *'TROPICAL MALADY' (No rating, 118 minutes, in Thai) Perched between two worlds, two consciousnesses and two radically different storytelling traditions, this Thai feature shows the young filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul pushing at the limits of cinematic narrative with grace and a certain amount of puckish willfulness. (Dargis)    'TWIST OF FAITH' (No rating, 87 minutes) Another demoralizing documentary about sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church (it was broadcast on HBO last week). As in so many cases in which priests have been accused of abuse, the details of the alleged crimes are maddeningly elusive. The documentary is an unhappy one, with no satisfying resolution. (Virginia Heffernan)    'UNDEAD' (R, 100 minutes) ''Undead,'' the debut feature from Australian twins Peter and Michael Spierig, is a broad, preposterous mishmash of zombie horror, old-fashioned sci-fi, spaghetti western, slapstick comedy, and high-tech ''Matrix''-style action. After small meteorites shower the quaint fishing village of Berkeley, Australia, infected inhabitants are transformed into brain-munching maniacs; then extraterrestrials inexplicably appear to save humankind. A stale, derivative mess that borrows heavily from every zombie and alien movie worthy of imitation. (Laura Kern)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    *'THE WHITE DIAMOND' (No rating, 90 minutes) Werner Herzog, in the jungles of Guyana, observes a small airship and its crew. This documentary is a record of his impressions and discoveries, and an essay on the complexities of nature in its wild and human varieties. It is an unassuming film, but nonetheless full of scenes and images that can only be described as sublime. (Scott)    * 'THE WORLD' (No rating, 133 minutes, in Mandarin) Globalization and its discontents form the molten core of ''The World,'' Jia Zhangke's fictionalized look at life inside a Disney-like entertainment park in China. This quietly despairing vision comes equipped with an ethnographic attention to detail, glints of surreal comedy and a scaled-down replica of the twin towers. (Dargis)    Film Series    AFTER VIGO (Through July 28) When Jean Vigo died (in 1934 at age 29), he had made only one full-length feature film. This festival pays tribute to Vigo's work (''Zero for Conduct,'' his 1933 short about a boarding school revolt, on Monday) and to directors and films directly influenced by him, including Lindsay Anderson's ''If'' (1968), to be shown on Tuesday.

(Kelefa Sanneh)    BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA, CITIZEN COPE (Sunday) After more than 60 years as a group, the Blind Boys of Alabama are no longer boys but gray-haired pillars of gospel quartet singing.

The latter-day beatnik Citizen Cope wallows in after-hours laments. 3 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)360-2777, free. (Jon Pareles)    THE BRAVERY, THE DEAD 60'S, NIC ARMSTRONG (Wednesday) The Bravery was supposed to be New York's Next Big Post-Strokes thing, but rumored ego issues have provoked skepticism. Liverpool's Dead 60's play derivative, serviceable ska and dub punk. Hailing from Nottingham, England, the energetic and versatile player-singer Nic Armstrong pays homage to 60's British rock from the Kinks to the Yardbirds. His purist take on the garage-rock revival has little use for the winking irony of other such acts. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $20, $23 at the door, sold out.

(Sinagra)    CONSTANTINES, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Tonight) The lead singer Bry Webb's baritone may rumble like that of other currently popular post-punk revivalists, but the Constantines' acute sense of drone and sting sets their darkly pulsing indie rock apart. The Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic mid-American forbears like the Embarassment. Tonight at 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston, (212)260-4700. $10. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, (718) 230-0236, $10.

(Sinagra)    DINOSAUR JR, BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE, RADIO 4, MAGIK MARKERS (Thursday) Dinosaur Jr, the seminal band that melded the apathetic cool of American punk with the guitar blare of stoned classic rock reunites its contentious original lineup. The Magik Markers opens, its noise-rock builds from buzzes to maelstroms of feedback. Broken Social Scene and Radio 4 also play. 6 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)360-2777, $37.25, $40 day of show. (Sinagra)    DO MAKE SAY THINK (Tomorrow) Bearing a passing resemblance to the work of the Canadian dirge merchants Godspeed You Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think builds songs in similar ominous waves. But this band has much jazzier prog rock tendencies. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $13, $15 at the door.(Sinagra)    DUNGEN (Thursday) This Swedish band's biker-rock combines humongous riffing with whimsical jams, conjuring both black-leather aggression and the pastoral wonder of the open road. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, sold out. (Sinagra)    THE FAB FAUX: THE LET IT BE ROOFTOP SESSIONS (Tuesday) The note-perfect Beatles tribute band isn't trying to win a costume contest. It's here to channel the original Fab Four's music, tone for tone, interval for interval, attack for attack. Here it tries to harness the acrimonious frisson of the ''Let It Be'' rooftop sessions. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival at the World Financial Center Plaza, West Street and Vesey Street, (212)528-2733, Free. (Sinagra)    ERIK FRIEDLANDER (Tuesday) This popular avant-garde cellist is bent on showing his instrument's range and applicability to diverse musical missions, veering easily from familiar deep, resonant tones to underworld shrieks and brutally sawed scrapes. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $10. (Sinagra)    HOP FU: 'PRODIGAL SON' SOUNDTRACKED BY ILLSTYLE (Tonight) The local arts and D.J. collective Illstyle makes hip-hop's fascination with martial arts remarkably manifest, creating a new soundtrack for the chop-socky flick ''Prodigal Son.'' 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, free ($3 suggested donation).

King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $26 to $30. (Sinagra)    WYCLEF JEAN (Thursday) If his head seems too big sometimes, the former Fugee Wyclef Jean's heart is in the right place. His wistful strummers and Caribbean-tinged hip-hop continues to incorporate global elements for purposes beyond dancefloor incitement. His soundtrack to the award-winning documentary ''The Agronomist'' furthered his advocacy of Haitian causes. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, 66th Street and Columbus Avenue, (212)721-6500. $25 to $40.

(Sinagra)    KENN KWEDER (Tuesday) The Philadelphia songwriter and guitarist Kenn Kweder has been writing prickly tunes about the arty urban subculture for three decades now. His onstage volatility used to rile the folkies, but when the punks came along and dug him, he rebuffed record label offers, preferring to do things his own way. 8:30 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, (212)941-8100, $15-$20. (Sinagra)    LADY SOVEREIGN, DJ A-TRAK, CATCHDUBS (Wednesday) Few MC's ride the jerky rhythms of grime, a British mix of hip-hop and techno, quite like this adorably brash 17 -year-old. Her appearance on this year's ''Run the Road'' compilation (Vice) was one of that excellent album's highlights and her first American show is hotly anticipated. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $12. (Sinagra)    ERIN MCKEOWN, IDA (Wednesday) This folk singer-songwriter has evolved since her days of spare, collegiate confessionals in the Ani DiFranco vein. Her new material is more lushly produced, and her musing more universal. Her Brooklyn band's harmonies mimic the binding sinews of for-better-or-worse relationships. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100, $15, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)    JOHN MELLENCAMP, JOHN FOGERTY (Tomorrow) Grown up and still pugnacious, John Mellencamp packs his three-chord heartland rock with anti-authority taunts and tough-minded comments on racism, family farms and woman trouble. John Fogerty's wild-eyed wail and distilled guitar twang are utterly undiminished, the sound of a mythic backwoods Southland where barefoot girls dance in the moonlight. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y, (516)221-1000, $35 to $79. (Pareles)    NAPPY ROOTS (Tonight) Though they've worked with the impresario Li'l Jon, their preference for shimmy over crunk, and their insistence on talking about the poor instead of the super-rich keeps them on margins of the mainstream. 11:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $20, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    POLYGRAPH LOUNGE (Tomorrow) Rob Schwimmer and Mark Stewart, two busy studio musicians fresh from touring with Simon and Garfunkel, indulge their more lighthearted side in Polygraph Lounge, which deploys a Spike Jones sensibility and a lot of low-tech and toy instruments. 5 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, 9th Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, free (suggested donation $3). (Pareles)    *REGGAE CARIFEST (Sunday) In years past, this annual summer concert brought dancehall reggae's leading lights to New York City, giving a charged-up crowd a chance to cheer for their favorite performers -- and boo their least favorites offstage. This year's installment pairs shouters (the ferocious Bounty Killer, the manic Elephant Man, the manic and ferocious Capleton) with their sweeter counterparts, including the protest singer Luciano, the impassioned crooner I Wayne (the man behind the hit ''Satisfy Her'') and the Hasidic upstart Matisyahu, who is likely to have either a very good day or a very bad one. 2 p.m., Randall's Island, (718) 856-5946 or (718)856-3336, $35 to $60. (Sanneh)    ROYKSOPP (Wednesday) This Norwegian duo made late 90's chill-room music for ravers exhausted by years of uptempto adventuring.

Recently, they've worked with the electro-pop singer Annie. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $20, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    SAOSIN, ANBERLIN (Sunday) These two emo bands specialize in rousing songs that embrace melancholy while nodding at chaos: Anberlin's songs strain toward grandeur but Saosin's twitch a little more and kick a little harder. With code: Seven and Terminal. 5 p.m., the Downtown, 190 Main Street, Farmingdale, N.Y., (516)293-7700, sold out. (Sanneh)    SUGAR WATER FESTIVAL: ERYKAH BADU, JILL SCOTT, QUEEN LATIFAH, FLOETRY (Tuesday) Popular purveyors of soulful female self-determination gather for a mini-tour of neo-soul stylings: Ms. Badu's slinky, cheeky afrocentric scrape, Ms. Scott's warm Philly funk, Queen Latifah's gutsy approach to her own hip-hop juvenilia and more recently, jazz standards, and Floetry's groovy uplift. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, NY, (516)221-1000, $21-76. (Sinagra)    DONNA SUMMER (Tomorrow) The disco diva who teamed up with the producer Giorgio Moroder to steam up the dancefloors with 70's and 80's hits like ''Love to Love You Baby'' and pop radio with burners like ''Bad Girls'' has long since left the sexpot thing behind for Jesus, but she still revisits her old hits with gusto. 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $68. (Sinagra)    SON VOLT (Tuesday) Back when he played country punk with Jeff Tweedy in the seminal band Uncle Tupelo, the singer and guitarist Jay Farrar gained adherents as the gruff, prematurely grizzled half of the duo, writing rueful songs about working class defeat in deadend towns, and some grudging prayers to the open road, too. A decade of solo work has reaffirmed that posture. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, (212)533-2111, $25, sold out. (Sinagra)    TEGAN AND SARA (Thursday) These Canadian twins' lyrics about love and loss are underground girl anthems.

(Sinagra)    TODD TERRY (Thursday) In the 1980's and early 1990's, this New York house-music D.J. helped define the sound of the city's dance clubs: his version of house music is tough and raucous, connecting dots between disco and hip-hop.

(Pareles)    LUCINDA WILLIAMS (Thursday) With homely details and the names of southern cities, Lucinda Williams maps geography of loss and longing in her songs.

(Chinen)    ROBERT GLASPER EXPERIMENT (Wednesday) There isn't a young musician with more buzz at the moment than Mr. Glasper, a bright and well-rounded pianist recently signed to Blue Note Records.

(Chinen)    LEW TABACKIN QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) As a tenor saxophonist, Mr. Tabackin combines gut instincts with encyclopedic command of jazz styles; as a flutist he favors Far Eastern timbres and scales. His band features the versatile pianist Benny Green. 8 and 9:45 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, (212)885-7119;cover, $20, $10 minimum.(Chinen)    BUSTER WILLIAMS AND SOMETHING MORE (Tuesday through July 17) Mr. Williams's bass playing is the anchor but not the focal point of this dynamic chamber-jazz quartet, with Steve Nelson, vibraphonist; Patrice Rushen, pianist; and Lenny White, drummer. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $30.

Opera    LAKE GEORGE OPERA (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) It doesn't get much lighter than this: ''The Mikado'' and Rossini's ''Italian Girl in Algiers'' are the summer's two offerings from the Lake George Opera, featuring able young singers, including Georgia Jarman as Yum-Yum and Jennifer Dudley as Rossini's Isabella. ''Mikado'' tomorrow afternoon at 2; ''Italian Girl'' tonight at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 2, Spa Little Theater, Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., (518)587-3330, $41 to $67. (Anne Midgette)    'RINALDO' (Tomorrow, Monday and Wednesday) The Berkshire Opera Company has offered solid performances of both standard and offbeat works over the years and has ensured that Tanglewood isn't the area's only musical attraction. In past years, the company has been hampered by theaters that didn't quite match its ambitions, but this season it is presenting some of its performances at the newly renovated Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center in Great Barrington, Mass. Its season opener is a semistaged production of Handel's ''Rinaldo,'' with a cast that has Christine Abraham in the title role, as well as Maureen O'Flynn, David Walker and John Cheek. Gary Thor Wedow conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Monday at 2 p.m. at the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center, Greet Barrington, Mass.; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Chapin Hall, at Williams College, Williamstown, Mass., (413)442-0099, $25 to $75. (Allan Kozinn)    Classical Music    BANG ON A CAN SUMMER MUSIC INSTITUTE (Starting Thursday) New music tends to find more sympathetic ears in the art public than many concert halls. Bang on a Can's summer learning program accordingly goes into the museum -- specifically, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Starting Thursday, daily concerts in the late afternoon showcase the institute's faculty, including the group's three original founders and, this year, Steve Reich. Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, North Adams, Mass., (413)662-2111. Concerts are free with gallery admission: $10, $8 for students, $4 for children. (Midgette)    CARAMOOR (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Thursday) Celebrating its 60th anniversary this season, Caramoor presents concerts on a vast scenic estate in northern Westchester County. Tonight, musicians from the Moab Music Festival in Utah take on Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' and Milhaud's jazz-infused ''Creation du Monde,'' but the weekend's main event is a rare staging of Bellini's opera ''La Sonnambula'' tomorrow with Will Crutchfield conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the coloratura soprano Sumi Jo in the title role. Sunday, it's a family concert led by Michael Barrett, and Thursday, the Jupiter Trio plays works by Beethoven, Dvorak and Schnittke. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1252, $15 to $85. (Jeremy Eichler)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music. Tonight, Adam Golka offers a program of mostly 19th-century piano transcriptions. Tomorrow and Sunday, it's music by Schubert, Beethoven, Fauré and a new work by Adolphus Hailstork with Mark Peskanov, violinist; Jeanne Mallow, violist; Sophie Shao, cellist; and Doris Stevenson, pianist. Thursday brings piano trios by Beethoven and Schubert. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083, $35; $25 for students. (Eichler)    MAVERICK CONCERTS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This concert series near Woodstock, N.Y., now in its 90th season, offers its performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. Tomorrow, the pianist Frederic Chiu performs works by Debussy, Ravel, Griffes and two works by Prokofiev (the Piano Sonata No. 2 and ''Visions Fugitives''), a composer Mr. Chiu has recorded with distinction. On Sunday, the flutist Carol Wincenc and the pianist Gina Raps play a hefty program with works by Bach, Fauré, Debussy, Varèse, Enescu, Griffes and Hindemith. Tomorrow night at 6, Sunday at 3 p.m., Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845)679-8217, $20, $5 for students. (Kozinn)    MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tonight and Sunday) Offering a mix of choral music, jazz, chamber concerts and a few other things as well, this venerable festival, now air-conditioned for the first time, presents medieval and Renaissance music sung by a costumed choir called the Everyman Guild tonight, and the Avalon String Quartet playing Haydn, Beethoven and the Brahms clarinet quintet (with Alexander Fiterstein) on Sunday afternoon, with the Salisbury Band as an anachronistic warmup. Tonight at 8, Sunday afternoon at 3 (band concert at 2), Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860)824-7126, $25, $12 for students under 24. (Midgette)    NAUMBURG ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Sure, the New York Philharmonic gets most of the attention, but Central Park has never been a one-orchestra green space. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, and on Tuesday, Carlos Miguel Prieto leads music by Barber, Bernstein, Copland, Ginastera and others. 7:30 p.m., Naumburg Band Shell, Central Park, midpark at 72nd Street, (718)340-3018, free. (Eichler)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) To fill out the calendar in the weeks between the end of the official season in June and the beginning of the popular free concerts in the parks in July, the orchestra is presenting its ''Summertime Classics'' series. If these programs, for the most part lighter works, don't go as far in the pops direction as the mighty Boston Pops, they should have some popular appeal. And the concerts are presented at budget prices. Tonight's program, ''Young at Heart,'' has chestnuts like ''The Nutcracker'' Suite and Britten's ''Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra.'' Tomorrow and Sunday the series ends with ''Soirée Française,'' featuring arias and songs from French opera and operetta. Both programs are conducted by Bramwell Tovey, who has a gift for introducing each work with wry British humor. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 5 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $19 to $49; half-price for children 12 and under tonight.(Anthony Tommasini)    TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Thursday) James Levine inaugurated his tenure as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra last fall with, you could say, a cosmic bang: Mahler's Eighth Symphony, the ''Symphony of a Thousand.'' A few days later he repeated that work at Carnegie Hall for his first official visit to New York as the head of the orchestra. Tonight, yet again, he begins his first summer at Tanglewood with the piece, though this team of vocal soloists includes some newcomers, among them the soprano Deborah Voigt and the tenor Johan Botha. Kurt Masur takes charge of the Boston Symphony for two programs tomorrow (the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with Joshua Bell and Bruckner's Fourth) and Sunday (Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto with Emanuel Ax and the Tchaikovsky Serenade for Strings). Ms. Voigt sings a recital on Tuesday and the Beaux-Arts Trio commemorates the 50th anniversary of its debut on Thursday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., in the Music Shed; Tuesday and Thursday at 8:30 p.m., in Ozawa Hall; Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200, $19 to $85; lawn seats for $16 and $17.

As usual, the casts are starry: Paloma Herrera, Carlos Acosta, Diana Vishneva, Maxim Beloserkovsky, Gillian Murphy and Angel Corella are to be in the ''Swan Lakes.'' Although Alessandra Ferri, scheduled for the first ''Giselle,'' is out for the season with an ankle injury, there will still be strong casts for all the ''Giselles.'' Particularly noteworthy nights include Tuesday, with Ms. Vishneva, Vladimir Malakhov and Veronika Part, and Thursday, when Amanda McKerrow is to give her final performance with the company. Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000 or www.abt.org, $22 to $130. (John Rockwell)    ARTICHOKE DANCE COMPANY (Thursday through July 17) Lynn Neuman's ''Look at Me (when I talk to you),'' a new work about moments that precipitate action or change, shares a program with the circuslike ''Origins.'' Thursday through July 17 at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479 $20, $10 students, 65+ and dancers. (Jack Anderson)    BARD SUMMERSCAPE: MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Through Sunday) As part of this summer season's theme of ''Copland and His World,'' the troupe dances ''Appalachian Spring,'' which Graham created to a luminous score by Aaron Copland, as well as ''Herodiade,'' to Hindemith, and ''Cave of the Heart,'' to Samuel Barber. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Fisher Center, Sosnoff Theater, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900, $25 to $55.

Tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m., Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, East 47th Street between First and Second Avenues, Manhattan, free. (Anderson)    IT'S A DANCE THING, TWO!

(Anderson)    *MERCE CUNNINGHAM'S 'OCEAN' (Tuesday through July 16) Those who have reservations about Mr. Cunningham's choreography find it all pretty much the same: anonymous, small-scaled, determinedly abstract dancing with grating electronic music. ''Ocean'' is very different, a grand spectacle. In 1996 I presented its American premiere at the first Lincoln Center Festival. Now, for its 10th installment, the festival is bringing it back for an encore, this time not in Damrosch Park but in the new Rose Theater. Mr. Cunningham's last collaboration with his longtime partner John Cage, ''Ocean'' uses a musical score (realized after Cage's death by Andrew Culver) for 112 droning musicians placed around the audience, with the dancers in the middle. Mr. Cunningham, true to his aesthetic, denies that he intended anything aquatic, but with blue-green costumes and lighting and David Tudor's outboard-motor-like electronic sounds, it certainly seems that way. Tuesday through July 16, 8 p.m. Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)271-6500, www.lincolncenter.org, $35 to $70. (Rockwell)    NOCHE FLAMENCA (Wednesdays through Sundays) A fiery company headed by the passionate Soledad Barrio returns for an extended engagement, through July 31.

Tonight through Sunday Ronald K. Brown and his Evidence company, with jazz and Billie Holiday, will alternate with Rennie Harris's Puremovement hip-hop troupe from Philadelphia. Mr. Brown at the Ted Shawn Theater, tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m. $45; $40.50 for students, seniors 65+ and children.

Lines at the Shawn Theater, Wednesday and Thursday, 8 p.m. $50; $45 for students, 65+ and children. Mr. Munisteri at the Duke Studio Theater, Thursday at 8:15. $20; $18 for students, seniors and children. Details of the week's free performances and exhibitions can be found on www.jacobspillow.org.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,'  through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    *BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs, by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. (See above.)(Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,'  through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    *EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,'  through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)    *GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,'  through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)    *GUGGENHEIM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 24. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. (See above.) (Smith)    *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The Dauguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,'  through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    *MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,'  through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART:'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)      NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with, scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavanger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 60's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: Uptown    'JOAN MITCHELL SKETCHBOOK: 1949-51' The 60 pages from a single notebook document an eventful period in this American painter's life, years that saw her moving between New York and Paris, and changing from a figurative to an abstract painter, consolidating a connection to French modernism, particularly to Cézanne and early Mondrian; and absorbing the spirit of the New York painters she felt closest to, Willem De Kooning, Arshile Gorky. Francis M. Naumann, 22 East 80th Street, Upper East Side, (212)472-6800, through July 15. (Cotter)    Galleries: 57th Street    RALPH BACERRA: 'OPULENT FIRE' Beautiful and technically awe-inspiring new teapots by this Los Angeles-based ceramicist have organically shaped, multi-part bodies cast from tree branches and surfaces richly glazed in fine geometric patterns. Garth Clark, 25 West 56th Street, (due to renovations of the main lobby), (212)246-2205, through Aug. 12.(Johnson)     ELIZABETH HEYERT: 'THE TRAVELERS' A touching show of 31 nearly life-size portraits of black people, dressed to the nines but with their eyes closed. They are dead, it turns out, and lying in their coffins. The set and costume designer for their opulent repose is a Harlem mortician named Isaiah Owens, who upholds a fading custom still observed by some blacks, of paying respect to the dead by seeing them off in sartorial splendor. Photographing them, Ms. Heyert came to believe that the portraits were not about death but about people's lives and their sharing of ''family, faith, traditions.'' Once you get over the startle factor, you can appreciate the elegance and restraint of her response to Mr. Owens's vision. Edwynn Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street, (212)750-7070, through July 23. (Glueck)    'OK/OKAY' This entertaining two-gallery exhibition introduces 14 European artists whose works in nontraditional media tend to read like overproduced one-liners. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, (212)925-2035; and Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212)998-6780, through July 16. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN'  Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing, but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through July 22. (Johnson)    'ELEVEN NGUYENS AND THE THIRTY YEAR LOSS' The independent curator Trong G. Nguyen has conceived a novel and bittersweet way to celebrate the recent anniversary of the surrender of South Vietnam to the communist North on April 30, 1975. He has gathered together works by 11 contemporary artists who all share the name Nguyen, which is pronounced ""win."" He contributes a cake with thick frosting of yellow paint and lettering that reads ""Happy Birthday War."" Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, (212)564-4480, through July 30. (Johnson)    'EVERLAND' This enchanting, 11-person show of fantasy landscapes assembled by independent curator David Gibson includes the watercolorist Russell Nachman's contemporary fairy painting; Ruth Waldman's delicately drawn web of mutant organs; confectionery table-top sculptures by Linda Ganjian, Kim Keever's constructed photograph of a scary, murky yellow mountainscape; and Sandra Bermudez's photograph of orchids whose petals turn out to be tiny Vegas showgirls. Annina Nosei, 530 West 22nd Street, (212)741-8695, through July 23. (Johnson)    'HOMOMUSEUM: HEROES AND MONUMENTS' With multiculturalist monuments to all kinds of minorities in place, how about a National Gay Hall of Fame, celebrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered culture? This group show of 27 artists could have been sharper and more exploratory than it is, but has good work and packs a lot of history. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 30. (Cotter)    *MOMUS AND MAI UEDA: 'I'LL SPEAK, YOU SING' From 1 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, Momus, the Scottish-born alternative-music legend, makes up stories, while Ms. Ueda, a Japanese performance artist, sings, comments and moves about. Zach Feuer Gallery (LFL), 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7700, through July 15. (Smith)    'MONOCHROME IMAGE' This show of single-color works in two and three dimensions include a man's suit, hat and shoes cast in pink rubber by David Baskin; a life-size giant squid of yellow crocheted yarn by Mary Carlson; an orange sculpture resembling a big clown's smile by John Monti; and a yellow wooden relief like a section of wainscoting by Francis Cape. Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212)463-9666, through July 22. (Johnson)    RICHARD STIPL: 'BLOC SABBATH' A dark minded humanist and skillful sculptor, Mr. Stipl creates small, creepy, extremely realistic, painted heads of grimacing men with secret society emblems or images of famous women tattooed on their shaved skulls. An ensemble of 10 one-fourth-life-size nude men on a shelf represents a Boschian satanic ritual. Claire Oliver, 513 West 26th Street, (212)929-5949, through July 23. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall, aqua-blue box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)     *MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    ALLAN DESOUZA: 'THE LOST PICTURES'  New pictures by this conceptualist photographer meditate on the photograph as a memorial object. Mr. deSouza placed prints made from old family slides around his home, allowing them to become faded and abraded and to accumulate hair, dust and other debris. He then turned them into large, glossy digital prints in which the ghosts of the original images haunt the new, busily textured, semi-abstract surfaces. Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, Union Square, (212) 673-3096, through July 29. (Johnson)    'EXCEEDING PAINT/EXPANDING PAINTING' In conceptual or formal ways, 14 artists subvert traditional painting. Approaches range from mildly rebellious -- as in Arturo Herrera's fusion of Abstract Expressionism and Disneyesque cartooning painted on the wall -- to mildly offensive, as in Philippe Meste's semen-splattered mirror. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778, through July 16. (Johnson)    VITALY KOMAR: 'THREE-DAY WEEKEND' The work in Mr. Komar's first solo show is more personal and less zanily satirical than the art he produced with his long-time collaborator Alex Melamid, but it does involve ingenious play with political and cultural signifiers. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)226-3232, through July 29. (Johnson)     JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 14. (Johnson)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    *VISUAL GLOSSOLALIA LUISE This unusual show of mediumistic writing -- often imaginary and usually embellished -- includes works by eight mostly American self-taught artists and one extraordinary Burmese yantra book from around 1900. Ross Gallery, 568 Broadway at Prince Street, SoHo, (212)343-2161, through July 15. (Smith)    Last Chance    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE' Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    DANA FRANKFORT: WHAT'S SO FUNNY In her debut exhibition, this young painter tries to add her own twist to the long tradition of language-based painting by inserting familiar words and phrases into fields of bright, shiny monochrome color. ''Yes,'' ''Now'' and ''Halleluiah,'' spelled in blocky letters that fill the canvases, glide in and out of view. Brooklyn Fire Proof, 101 Richardson Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)302-4702, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China, closing on Sunday. (See above.) (Smith)    MET: 'MAX ERNST' Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus, closing on Sunday. (See above.) (Cotter)     'WOODS' Works made of and about wood and trees include miniature firs in Styrofoam planters by Carin Mincemoyer; conflations of Minimalist form and furniture-making craft by Richard Bottwin; a walk-in spiral maze by Leo Berk; Caitlin Bermingham's oddly creepy fake plants; Eric Kidhart's faux-populist illustrations made using woodburning tools; and Justin Witte's white-on-white cartoon visions of bizarre woodland activities. Dumbo Art Center, 30 Washington Street, Brooklyn, (718)694-0831, closing on Monday.
