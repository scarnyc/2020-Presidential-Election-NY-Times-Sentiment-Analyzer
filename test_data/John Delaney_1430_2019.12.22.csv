3,"Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the Northeast this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.    Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'EVENSONG' Opens today. Mary Gage's new play is based on interviews with survivors of the Great Depression and World War II (1:35). TBG Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101.    'THE FANTASTICKS' In previews; opens on Aug. 23. If you were one of the people who missed the 17,162 performances of this show the last time around, good news: Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones's romantic musical, which closed in 2002, is back (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100.    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' In previews; opens on Thursday. This musical sendup of biographical shows features Martin Short and an ensemble telling the story of his life. Mr. Short's beloved old characters, like Ed Grimley and Jiminy Glick, make appearances (2:15). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' In previews; opens Aug. 21. Meryl Streep plays the title character in Tony Kushner's translation of Brecht's seminal play about a world at war. Kevin Kline also stars, and George C. Wolfe directs (2:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park. Free. Ticket information: (212) 539-8750.    'SEVEN GUITARS' In previews; opens Aug. 24. Signature Theater presents its first August Wilson revival since the playwright's death last year. Ruben Santiago-Hudson, who starred in the 1996 Broadway production, directs (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.    Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'AMAJUBA: LIKE DOVES WE RISE' Tormenting memories dissolve into soaring music, and pain is salved by a collective embrace in this heartfelt, powerfully performed theater piece about life under apartheid. The recollections of the five cast members and authors are woven together with a cappella performances of spirituals from the apartheid years and vignettes performed by the full cast. The actors all but glow with a sense of mission, as if telling their stories has given them new purpose and power (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)    'ANAIS NIN: ONE OF HER LIVES' Angela Christian is superb as Nin in this uneven but largely rewarding production about her affair with Henry Miller and his wife, June, in Paris in the 1930's (1:30). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)    'EVERYTHINgS TURNING INTO BEAUTIFUL' Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's thrill-free demi-musical about a pair of commitment-wary songwriters (Daphne Rubin Vega and Malik Yoba) is clearly intended to progress from wintry loneliness to heated confrontation and eroticism. But it remains stolidly at room temperature. Directed by Carl Forsman, with songs by Jimmie James. (1:50). Acorn Theater, 410 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200 (Anita Gates)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'SHOUT!' A mini-skirted, go-go booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the show room of a Carnival Cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A STONE CARVER' Despite the high cliché factor, William Mastrosimone's play about an Italian immigrant who is losing his house to a highway exit is timely and sporadically touching, in large part because of Dan Lauria's over-the-top performance as the title character and old-world patriarch who makes a mean barrel of wine and never talks when he can shout (1:40). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Andrea Stevens)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE & OTHER STORY BOOKS' This children's musical, made up of 10 sketches based on 8 books, is diverse, adorable and free. Also, the adults laugh (1:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 642-9033. (Gates)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ALL THIS INTIMACY' In this not-very-deep comedy-drama by Rajiv Joseph, a 30-year-old poet impregnates not only his girlfriend, but also two other women, within two weeks. The women, once they meet, are surprisingly unimpressed with his notable virility (1:45). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422; closing tomorrow. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'NEVER TELL' The computer-involved characters in James Christy's intriguing drama about trust, video art and a society-changing application can be irritating but they're never boring (1:50). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott)    'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)     'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Holden)    * 'THE BRIDESMAID' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) The great Claude Chabrol again takes up a sharp instrument and directs it at one of his favorite targets, the family. Yet while his aim remains true, his touch has become gentler, more forgiving. (Dargis)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)    'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    * 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    * 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeois Parisian marriage, about 1912. (Dargis)    'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden) * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    'I LIKE KILLING FLIES' (R, 79 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Matt Mahurin paints an engaging if glib portrait of Kenny Shopsin, of the legendary or notorious, depending on your experience, Greenwich Village eatery that bears his name. (Dargis)    'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Nathan Lee)    * 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)    * 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)    * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)    'MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Arabic, English and Kurdish) Filmed in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2005, ''My Country, My Country'' views the prelude to the January elections primarily through the eyes of Dr. Riyadh, a Sunni candidate and physician who runs a free clinic in Baghdad. Without comment but with unusual sensitivity, the director, Laura Poitras, exposes the emotional toll of occupation on Iraqis and United States soldiers alike, leaving us feeling that this particular mission is far from accomplished. (Jeannette Catsoulis)     'THE NIGHT LISTENER' (R, 82 minutes) Robin Williams plays a writer and radio host who strikes up a long-distance friendship with a young man who may not exist. An intriguing premise, but not satisfyingly realized. (Scott)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)     * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'THE PUFFY CHAIR' (R, 85 minutes) Three 20-somethings on the road with a recliner. Sweet but minor (Scott)    * 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    'SATELLITE' (No rating, 100 minutes) In this captivating romantic fairy tale for grown-ups, made on a shoestring, two young lovers in New York flee yuppie hell into a life of petty theft. (Holden)    * SCOOP (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)    'SHADOWBOXER' (R, 93 minutes) This garish thriller starring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as contract killers and lovers is an extravagance that leaves you with your mouth hanging open -- partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness. (Holden)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Farrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (A. O. Scott)    '13 TZAMETI'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)    'THE TROUBLE WITH MEN AND WOMEN' (No rating, 74 minutes) This tiny, well-acted movie about the romantic troubles besetting two young couples in London feels at once utterly real and banal. (Holden)     * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. (Dargis)    * 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    YOU, ME AND DUPREE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)    Film Series    THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS (Through Sept. 25) Film Forum's eight-film, eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) continues on Monday night with ''The Navigator'' (1924), about a spoiled rich couple who find themselves on a deserted passenger ship. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.

This weekend's films include ''Strange Cargo'' (1940), with Joan Crawford and Clark Gable suffering on a tropical island, and ''Secrets'' (1933), starring Mary Pickford and Leslie Howard in the story of a marriage held together by lies. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    FROM THE TSARS TO THE STARS: A JOURNEY THROUGH RUSSIAN FANTASTIK CINEMA (Through Aug. 24) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's tribute to Russian science fiction and fantasy films begins today. This weekend's features include Karen Shakhnazarov's ''Zero City'' (1988), about a Moscow engineer who finds himself in a very strange small town, and Pavel Klushanstev's ''Planet of Storms'' (1961), about cosmonauts who find prehistoric beasts on Venus.

(Gates)    Pop  Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133, dannysgrandseapalace.com; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Stephen Holden)    DEERHOOF, BEIRUT (Sunday) A decade into Deerhoof's career, this avant-garde rock band from San Francisco still has plenty of surprises. Its stop-start songs, with jagged guitars, a drum style somewhere between jazz and metal, and Satomi Matsuzaki's nursery-rhyme vocals, sound intriguingly extraterrestrial. Beirut is the project of Zach Condon, an Albuquerque native who at age 19 made ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), an album of somber and ecstatic Balkan Gypsy marches, recording most of the horns, pianos, organs, percussion and even ukulele and mandolins himself. With Apollo Sunshine, the Harlem Shakes and, playing D.J., ?uestlove from the Roots. At 3 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, thepoolparties.com; free. (Ben Sisario)    DIRTY PRETTY THINGS (Monday and Tuesday) After the tunefully frantic British band the Libertines split a couple of years ago, its singer, Pete Doherty, formed Babyshambles and entered tabloid purgatory, while its talented and less arrest-prone guitarist, Carl Barât, and its drummer, Gary Powell, formed Dirty Pretty Things. The band's debut album, ''Waterloo to Anywhere'' (Interscope), sounds like the Strokes tearing through Kinks songs. With Scissors for Lefty. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)    JEREMY ENIGK (Tonight) In the 1990's, Mr. Enigk was the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, a Seattle group that did as much as anybody to transform emo from a relatively obscure offshoot of hardcore punk into the populist form of yearning and tantrum-throwing that it is today. His first solo album in a decade, ''World Waits'' (Lewis Hollow), is to be released in October. With Stars of Track and Field. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)    FORRÓ IN THE DARK (Wednesday) For more than three years now, this group has been leading one of New York's best and lowest-tech dance parties at the East Village bar Nublu. The groove is a humble and sexy two-beat dance from northeastern Brazil called forró, made with accordion, hand-held percussion and, since this is New York, whiffs of distorted electric guitar. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., 62 Avenue C, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, nublu.net; $10. (Sisario)    DIAMANDA GALÁS (Thursday) She is invariably dressed in black, her face in witchy streaks of makeup, but Diamanda Galás needs only her voice to terrify, seduce and beguile. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from darkened Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. In the second of four shows at the new Spiegeltent downtown, she offers ''O Death,'' with music by John Lee Hooker, Phil Ochs, Ralph Stanley, Hank Williams and Shel Silverstein. At 6 p.m., Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Sisario)     * GNARLS BARKLEY, PEEPING TOM (Thursday) Every summer needs a Gnarls Barkley. This brilliantly nutty duo, featuring the producer-alchemist Danger Mouse and the helium-voiced singer and rapper Cee-Lo Green, has scored the surprise hit of the season with ''Crazy,'' an arty hip-hop goof disguised as a slow-burn soul song -- or is that a slow-burn soul song disguised as an arty hip-hop goof? The band plays a benefit concert for Central Park SummerStage with Peeping Tom, the latest project of Mike Patton, the naughty boy of heavy metal turned naughty boy of the avant-garde. The gimmick here is creepy lounge and trip-hop, with guests ranging from Norah Jones to the bawdily bizarre rapper Kool Keith. Who knows which guests will turn up, although Mr. Patton may not need any help: for the album, ''Peeping Tom'' (Ipecac), he worked alone and traded tapes with his collaborators. At 7 p.m. Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777 or (212) 307-7171, summerstage.org; sold out. Peeping Tom also plays Wednesday at 8 p.m. at Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)    IRON & WINE, LOW (Thursday) Reverse psychology: instead of trying to fill a gigantic space like the McCarren Park Pool with lots of loud noise, do it with a reverent hush. Iron & Wine, which is the singer and guitarist Sam Beam and whoever he happens to be playing with, specializes in gentle acoustic lullabies whose vocals compete with the guitar over which can be more whispery. Low, a veteran band from Duluth, Minn., uses grand, glacial dynamics to give its semiloud climaxes the weight of religious epiphanies. Also on the bill is Califone, a fine band from the Chicago experimental scene that plays wistful songs with a constant, thin hum. At 5 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $32.50 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)    CHRIS ISAAK (Thursday) Chris Isaak is a disciple of Roy Orbison, writing dolorous ballads that find their only consolation in his honeyed voice and finely turned guitar lines. Onstage he's a droll storyteller. With Tristan Prettyman. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $30 to $100. (Jon Pareles)    JURASSIC 5 (Wednesday) This hip-hop quintet from Los Angeles harks back to the genial wordplay and jazz vamps of New York's fondly remembered Native Tongues groups, like A Tribe Called Quest. With X-Clan. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Pareles)    JORMA KAUKONEN (Thursday) One of the original psychedelic blues players, Jorma Kaukonen brought Jefferson Airplane both searing electric guitar lines and old-fashioned blues. He then founded Hot Tuna, a band built on spiky, ragtimey blues. His own songs contemplate death and loss, holding his gentle voice in a lattice of fingerpicking. With Rob McNurlin. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $36.50. (Pareles)    CHRIS KNIGHT (Tuesday) Cold-eyed drifters, crooked yet sentimental cops, and prostitutes who kill their johns are characters in the brutal, deadpan songs of Chris Knight, a country singer from Kentucky whose oeuvre resembles Bruce Springsteen's album ''Nebraska'' set in the South. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)    LINCOLN CENTER OUT OF DOORS (Tonight and tomorrow) Tonight this annual series of free outdoor concerts presents L. Subramaniam, a renowned violinist in the Carnatic style of southern India. He has also recorded with Stéphane Grappelli and Yehudi Menuhin, and plays here with the American classical violinist Eugene Fodor. Tomorrow is one of Out of Doors' many blues-themed concerts. This one looks at the roots and reflections of blues around the world, with Markus James, an American guitarist and singer; Hassan Hakmoun, a master of the gnawa music of Morocco, which is as richly bluesy as it is ecstatic; Fantasia Music, a group that plays rebetika, the rough-and-tumble songs of the Greek underworld; Gazpacho Andalú, a New York flamenco band; and Helder Moutinho, a Portuguese fado singer. The host tomorrow is Guy Davis. Tonight at 8 and tomorrow night at 7, Damrosch Park Bandshell, (212) 875-5766, lincolncenter.org. (Sisario)    ASHA PUTHLI, PREFUSE 73, TALVIN SINGH (Sunday) Asha Puthli, a trailblazing Indian singer who has performed with everybody from Ornette Coleman to Ashford and Simpson, makes her first New York appearance in 25 years, with Dewey Redman, Guru, Solar and DJ Doo Wop. She is joined by Prefuse 73, also known as the hip-hop producer Guillermo Scott Herren, and, performing a D.J. set, Talvin Singh, whose experiments mixing traditional Indian music with abstract electronic dance music have been widely influential. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free, but a donation is suggested. Mr. Singh also plays on Sunday at 9:30 p.m. at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)    LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tonight and Sunday) Las Rubias del Norte, long in residence at Barbès, a cozy bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, play boleros, cumbias and other Latin styles, elegantly arranged for a small band and two songbird sopranos. At 6 p.m., Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $15. (Sisario)    * SONIC YOUTH, YEAH YEAH YEAHS (Tonight and tomorrow) These two bands emerged, decades apart, from the same dank and claustrophobic downtown (and Brooklyn) clubs to define avant-garde New York rock. So it is only appropriate that when they share a big stage, it is a really big and really unusual stage: the 50,000-square-foot McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn. Both have released strong albums this year, and they headline these two nights at the pool, joined by Blood on the Wall tonight and Awesome Color tomorrow. At 5 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, (212) 307-7171; $36 in advance, $41 at the door. (Sisario)    STEELY DAN, MICHAEL McDONALD (Thursday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature'' (Warner Brothers), and Donald Fagen and Walter Becker crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as Steely Dan's lead guitarist. Michael McDonald, the smoky-voiced crooner who has been through Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers and a long solo career, has most recently recorded two albums of Motown songs. At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $35 to $95. (Pareles)    'SUGAR WATER FESTIVAL' (Tomorrow) Queen Latifah, Jill Scott and Erykah Badu play a benefit for Celebrate Brooklyn, with Kelis. At 7 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $70 for reserved seating, $45 on the lawn. (Sisario)    THROWING MUSES, 50 FOOT WAVE (Tomorrow) Throughout the 1980's and 90's Kristin Hersh led Throwing Muses, the textbook college-rock band: witty, imaginative, small-scale and entirely non-macho. (The presence of as many as three women in the band helped that.) But there was nothing textbook about the band's songs, which set turbulent and free-associative psychodramas to twisting and unpredictable guitar lines. The band reunited in 2003 after six years, by which time Ms. Hersh had developed a successful solo career and started a new, punkier band, 50 Foot Wave. Both play tomorrow, along with Bullseye. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $20. (Sisario)    * WILD MAGNOLIA MARDI GRAS INDIANS, IRMA THOMAS (Tomorrow) One of the more elaborate Mardi Gras traditions in New Orleans is the black men who parade, dance and otherwise revel as ''Indians,'' dressed in impossibly flamboyant costumes loosely based on American Indian designs. Working for months each year, the men sew in extensive patterns of sequins, glitter and beadwork, and fasten the feathers tightly in preparation for lots of dancing. Led by Bo Dollis, the Wild Magnolias, one of the three dozen or so ''tribes,'' make a rare visit. Irma Thomas was a New Orleans soul queen when her version of ''Time Is on My Side'' inspired the Rolling Stones in 1964. Her home and nightclub destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, she recently released her first new album in six years, ''After the Rain'' (Rounder). At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free, but a suggested $30 donation will benefit the New Orleans Musicians' Clinic, a nonprofit medical center.(Sisario)    * WU-TANG CLAN (Thursday) The eight surviving representatives of hip-hop's most ingenious and eccentric band-cum-brand name team up for a rare tour in tribute to Russell Tyrone Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, the especially ingenious, eccentric and self-destructive member who died in 2004. With Rhymefest. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $50. (Sisario)    Jazz  Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    TOSHIKO AKIYOSHI TRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) A couple of years ago Ms. Akiyoshi retired her acclaimed big band, ending a standing Birdland engagement. Returning to the club with a trio, she places emphasis on her articulate piano playing, a treat in itself. Through Aug. 19. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)    J. D.

(Chinen)    MICHAEL BLAKE TRIO (Wednesday) ''Right Before Your Very Ears'' (Clean Feed), Mr. Blake's most recent album, showcases his tenor saxophone in a rough-hewn but deeply focused pianoless trio setting. Here he enlists musicians different from those on the album -- Marcs Rojas on tuba, and G. Calvin Weston on drums -- but employs a similar concept. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.      (Chinen)    GERALD CLEAVER TRIO (Thursday) Dealing less in rhythm than in pulse, Mr. Cleaver's drumming perfectly suits the fluid requirements of jazz's post-everything avant-garde. He has sympathetic partners in the pianist Craig Taborn and the bassist William Parker. At 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    ELLERY ESKELIN TRIO (Sunday) Mr. Eskelin is a tenor saxophonist known for gruff abandon; his signature band with the accordionist Andrea Parkins and the drummer Jim Black handles abstraction as well as groove.

(Chinen)    GROUP FIVE (Wednesday) With a lineup suggestive of the Brian Blade Fellowship, this ensemble would seem to pursue similar pastoral fusions. But the placement of this one-night engagement -- The Stone, an avant-garde shrine -- might elicit a more raucous mood from Mr. Blade, on drums; Jon Cowherd, on piano; Doug Weiss, on bass; and Joel Frahm and Myron Walden, on saxophones. At 8 and 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.

(Chinen)    DONNY McCASLIN SEPTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. McCaslin, an assertive tenor and soprano saxophonist and, increasingly, an accomplished composer, introduces a commissioned long-form piece called ''In Pursuit.''

(Chinen)    JEB PATTON TRIO (Wednesday) Mr. Patton has lately earned accolades as the pianist with the Heath Brothers, and he has a new self-produced album, ''A Lovesome Thing,'' that confirms his freshness in a trio setting. His working band includes David Wong on bass and Peter Van Nostrand on drums.

(Chinen)    BRANDON ROSS AND BLAZING BEAUTY (Sunday) Mr. Ross goes for earthy yet otherworldly effect in both his guitar playing and his compositions. In this ensemble he stirs in some vivid colors: Graham Haynes's cornet, Stomu Takeishi's acoustic bass guitar and J. T. Lewis's drums and percussion. At 8 p.m., Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Modern Art, 15 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9491, moma.org/events/summergarden; free, but tickets, required for entry, will be distributed at 5:30 p.m. on a first-come-first-served basis. (Chinen)    DAVID SÁNCHEZ QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Sánchez is a tenor and soprano saxophonist equally conversant in the rigors of post-bop and the nuances of Latin folk music, notably from his native Puerto Rico. He digs in here with some longtime colleagues: Edsel Gomez on piano, Ben Street on bass and Adam Cruz on drums. Through Aug. 20.

(Chinen)    * JENNY SCHEINMAN TRIO (Thursday) Ms. Scheinman is a violinist attracted to rusticity but committed to a modern language; the same could be said, more or less, of the drummer Paul Motian and the pianist Jason Moran. Still, this all-star trio carries the burden of a small spectacle: it could be transcendent or a train wreck, and either way it will be something to behold. Through Aug. 20.

(Chinen)    * CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND (Thursday) Mr. Tolliver leads an upgraded edition of his acclaimed orchestra of the 1970's, with such top-shelf talent as the saxophonists Billy Harper and Craig Handy, the trombonist Clark Gayton, the pianist Robert Glasper and the bassist Cecil McBee. The band will be featured on a forthcoming Blue Note album, but that's no reason not to absorb its visceral impact in person. Through Aug. 20.

(Chinen)    CEDAR WALTON QUINTET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) As a pianist and composer, Mr. Walton heeds an articulate, almost courtly variety of hard bop; he's at his best when his forms spark solos from collaborators like Steve Turre, a trombonist (through Sunday only), and Vincent Herring, an alto saxophonist (next week.) Through Aug. 20. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

Opera    GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Tuesday, and Thursday) Opera can be formal or pure fluff, and this season's program at Glimmerglass about equally balances the two. All four of this year's operas are in rotation this week: Janacek's dark ''Jenufa'' in the Jonathan Miller production (tonight and Thursday night at 8, Monday afternoon at 1:30); Steven Hartke's brand-new, Maupassant-based opera ''The Greater Good'' (tomorrow and Tuesday at 1:30 p.m.); and, on the lighter side, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance'' (tomorrow night at 8) and Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' (Sunday afternoon at 1:30).

(Anne Midgette)    Classical Music    BARD FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Leon Botstein's annual composer-focused festival is devoted to Franz Liszt this year, and, as in past summers, it includes concerts, lectures and panel discussions, for which a large cast of experts -- both players and speakers -- has been assembled. The opening weekend includes six programs, beginning with an all-Liszt catchall concert tonight, in which a handful of pianists, singers and a choir offers a broad selection of works meant to show Liszt as a mirror of his time. A concert tomorrow afternoon broadens the focus, putting Liszt's music beside other composers' scores, including Chopin, Czerny, Moscheles, Hummel, Beethoven, Schubert and Clara Wieck Schumann. Tomorrow evening Liszt's music is related to the currents in 19th-century art, theater and politics, by way of his symphonic poems. Sunday begins with chamber music, mostly by Liszt's contemporaries; an afternoon concert shows the shadow cast not only on Liszt, but also on Brahms and Schumann, by the virtuoso violinist and composer Paganini. Later in the afternoon Mr. Botstein closes the first of two weekends by drifting away from the rugged muscularity of Liszt, and offering a concert of opera excerpts, including bel canto twaddle by Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini. Tonight at 8:30, $20 to $45; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., $35; and at 8 p.m., $25 to $55; Sunday at 10:30 a.m., $30; at 1:30 p.m., $35; and at 5:30 p.m., $25 to $55.

(Allan Kozinn)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) Good things come in threes, and Steven Beck, a pianist, seems to have achieved a happy tripartite balance for his recital, with three Bach preludes and fugues, three Shostakovich preludes and fugues, and three early Mozart sonatas. The mood changes considerably for the weekend's other concert at this floating hall: the Corigliano Quartet goes larger-scale with Dvorak's Piano Quintet in A (with Doris Stevenson), Schumann's first quartet and ''Corrie Q's Jigs and Reels'' by Adam B. Silverman. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35 tonight ($30 for 65+; $20 for students), and $40 tomorrow and Sunday ($25 for students).

Tonight Caramoor's composer-in-residence, John Musto, will perform Bach's French Suite No. 5 in G and two of his own works as part of the Extreme Chamber Music series. Amy Burton, a soprano; Steven Tharp, a tenor; and Theodora Hanslowe, a mezzo-soprano, will join Mr. Musto for his ''Book of Uncommon Prayer.'' Music From Copland House, a vibrant ensemble dedicated to championing new music, will play Mr. Musto's Sextet for Clarinet, Strings and Piano (with the composer as pianist). For the festival's finale tomorrow, Donald Runnicles will lead Ingrid Fliter in a performance of Mozart's Piano Concerto in A (K. 488) with the Orchestra of St. Luke's. The program also includes Mozart's ''Jupiter'' Symphony and John Adams's Chamber Symphony. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 149 Girdle Ridge Road, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252, caramoor.org; $27 to $37 tonight, $17.50 to $67.50 tomorrow. (Vivien Schweitzer)    COMPOSERS COLLABORATIVE (Tonight and tomorrow) Established in its wonted (and literally underground) summer haunt, the Composers Collaborative is offering, during its mini-festival, the same piece it did last year: Jed Distler's longtime work-in-progress, ''The Gold Standard.'' This music theater work concludes the proceedings tomorrow; tonight's concert features two trios, First Avenue and Maya, performing inventive contemporary chamber music. Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 663-1967, composerscollab.org; $25; $15 for students, with a one-drink minimum. (Midgette)    MARLBORO MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Seven intense weeks of chamber music conclude on Sunday with Beethoven's ''Choral Fantasy,'' a tradition started 30 years ago by Rudolf Serkin, a festival founder and the longtime artistic director. Ignat Solzhenitsyn will lead Mitsuko Uchida, the pianist and co-artistic director, as well as a chorus and orchestra made up of Marlboro resident artists, family members and innkeepers. Tonight's program includes Haydn's ''Arianna a Naxos,'' with the mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford; Donald Martino's Quartet No. 5, with the violist Samuel Rhodes of the Juilliard Quartet; and Brahms's Trio in B with Mr. Solzhenitsyn as pianist. Tomorrow's program includes Beethoven's ''To the Distant Beloved,'' with the young baritone Thomas Meglioranza, and Takemitsu's ''Entre-Temps'' for oboe and string quartet. On Sunday Mozart's Serenade in C minor for woodwinds; Brahms's Four Songs for vocal quartet, two horns and harp (Op. 17); and Britten's String Quartet No. 3 will precede the finale. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, and Sunday at 2:30, Marlboro Music School and Festival, Marlboro, Vt., (802) 254-2394, marlboromusic.org; $15 to $30; $5 for canopy areas. (Schweitzer)    MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL (Tonight through Wednesday) This dual celebration -- the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth, and the 40th of the festival itself -- is in high gear, with standard concerts, late-night programs and odd explorations like the collaborations between Concerto Köln, an early-music group, and Sarband, which specializes in Middle Eastern music. Often, you can do it all: tonight and tomorrow night at 8, you can catch the pianist and conductor Christian Zacharias presiding over a program that includes Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto (K. 466), the ''Posthorn'' Serenade and a handful of arias, sung by Sally Matthews. Then, at 10:30, Sarband and Concerto Köln play their multicultural concerts, a different program each night. The pianist Emanuel Ax plays a late-night Mozart program on Tuesday, and on Wednesday Peter Phillips directs the Tallis Scholars in sacred works by Mozart's predecessors -- including the Allegri ''Miserere,'' which, according to legend, Mozart wrote from memory after hearing it once. Mr. Zacharias's concerts are at 8 p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; $35 to $55. Concerto Köln and Sarband's concerts are at 10:30 p.m. at the Allen Room, Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street; $35. Mr. Ax's recital is at 10:30 p.m. at the Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street; $35. The Tallis Scholars program is at 8 p.m. at the Rose Theater at Rose Hall; $35 to $60. (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org. (Kozinn)    'MOZART ON FILM' (Monday) Film about Mozart has long had a place at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, but there are always new things to be seen. ''In Search of Mozart,'' a film by Phil Grabsky, is a biographical documentary, narrated by Juliet Stevenson, and including performances and observations by a broad array of interpreters, from period-instrument specialists like the Orchestra of the 18th Century and the conductor Roger Norrington, to modern players like the pianists Lang Lang and Imogen Cooper, and the singers Renée Fleming and Magdalena Kozena. ''Mozart Interpreted,'' a series of three short films, includes performances of Mozart's Symphony No. 40, from a 1948 broadcast by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra; Karl Böhm's account of the Symphony No. 38, with the Vienna Philharmonic, from 1978; and Nikolaus Harnoncourt leading the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in the Symphony No. 41, from 1991. ''In Search of Mozart'' is at 6 p.m.; ''Mozart Interpreted'' is at 9 p.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $15. (Kozinn)    NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) The Tokyo String Quartet returns to the Yale Summer School of Music's prestigious chamber music program. The quartet will perform Beethoven's Quartet in C minor (Op. 18, No. 4); Brahms's Quartet in B flat; and Michio Mamiya's ''Song of the White Wind.'' At 8 p.m., Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000, yale.edu/norfolk; $15 to $45. (Schweitzer)    TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) Perhaps because the offerings are particularly diverse, tickets for the festival this month have been discounted. Tonight's concert should be a treat: Bach and Handel conducted by the capable early-music specialist Harry Bicket, with the mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly, and actual fireworks after the ''Royal Fireworks Music.'' Tomorrow the Boston Pops offer film scores in a deluxe edition with Yo-Yo Ma, John Williams and narration by James Earl Jones; on Sunday Christoph Eschenbach leads the Philadelphia Orchestra in Beethoven's Eighth and Tchaikovsky's Fifth. Some might want to stick around until Monday to hear the student orchestra of the Tanglewood Music Center, led by Herbert Blomstedt, in Beethoven and Hindemith. On Thursday the Renaissance vocalists the Tallis Scholars offer Schütz, Allegri and others. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., $20 to $50; Monday at 8:30 p.m., $11 to $36; Thursday at 8:30 p.m., $16 to $49. Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200, tanglewood.org.

(Jennifer Dunning)    * CENTRAL PARK SUMMER STAGE (Tonight) With a little luck, the only heat in the park tonight will be onstage as two powerful modern-dance companies perform repertory selections in the closing weekend of this festival. One is Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's Urban Bush Women, known for funny, angry, compassionate dancing about everyday life and social history. The company will perform ''Walking With Pearl  Africa Diaries,'' an evocative, eloquent tribute to the modern-dance pioneer Pearl Primus. The other is Jamel Gaines's rafter-raising Creative Outlet troupe. Tonight at 8, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free. (Dunning)    CHOREOGRAPHY CAFÉ (Wednesday) Featured artists are Heidi Latsky and Alan Good in this informal series presented by Dancewave, which invites professional choreographers who work with children and teenagers.

(Dunning)    * CITY PARKS DANCE (Tomorrow) The City Parks Foundation went for the big names in New York modern dance for this performance and dance-lesson series. Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and the Urban Bush Women will follow tonight's Summerstage performance with ''Give Your Hands to Struggle'' from ''Hands Singing Song,'' with music by Sweet Honey in the Rock, and excerpts from ''Walking With Pearl  Southern Diaries.'' Illystyle & Peace Productions will share the program with a fast-moving, exuberant tribute to break-dancing. And Ms. Zollar will teach the program's opening class, ''How We Got to the Funk,'' an exploration of the cultural history inherent in African-American social dances from the 1950's through the 70's. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Amphitheater, Von King Park, 670 Lafayette Avenue, between Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (212) 360-8290, cityparksfoundation.org; free.

In the smaller Doris Duke Studio Theater through the weekend is MoveOpolis, the company formed by Richard Move, who made his name as a Martha Graham impersonator, and moving in on Thursday is Choreftes, a Greek company making its United States debut. Shen Wei, tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Pacific Northwest Ballet, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8. At the Shawn Theater, $50.

This one, a world premiere, was commissioned by the Mostly Mozart Festival and will offer the Mark Morris Dance Group performing to two Mozart piano concertos (K. 413 and 595) and the Sonata in D for two pianos (K. 448), with Louis Langrée conducting the Festival Orchestra and the pianists Emanuel Ax and Yoko Nozaki.

Tonight and tomorrow nights at 8, and tomorrow at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42.

(Anderson)    STREET THEATER COMPANY (Tomorrow and Sunday) The show is called ''Tap Dance,'' but its title specifically refers to wiretapping. Still, everyone in the cast will do some tap dancing in this production, which tours the city through Sept. 17.

Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, or folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GRAFFITI,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 or brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)    * DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606 or daheshmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)    * FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ÉTIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 or frick.org. (Holland Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500 or guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'ATTA KIM: ON AIR,' through Aug. 27. The South Korean artist Atta Kim's best-known body of work is a series called ''The Museum Project'' (1995-2002), for which he photographed his human subjects -- families, nude couples, maimed war veterans -- locked inside plexiglass exhibition cases like specimens on display. The series eventually took a religious turn, with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures here, in his first major American solo show, continue this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 or icp.org. (Cotter)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early-19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * MET: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 4 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable.40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 or madmuseum.org. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE WORD ON THE STREET: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF LARRY RACIOPPO,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500 or mobia.org. (Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Kimmelman)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: DOUGLAS GORDON: 'TIMELINE,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Johnson)    NEUE GALERIE: GUSTAV KLIMT: FIVE PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF FERDINAND AND ADELE BLOCH-BAUER,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 or neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)     NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700 or nybg.org. (Johnson)    * NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 or nyhistory.org. (Cotter)    NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 or nypl.org. (Smith)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088 or noguchi.org. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 or ps1.org. (Johnson)    * RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS IT? HIMALAYAN ART' This museum is an oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000 or rmanyc.org. (Cotter)    WADSWORTH ATHENEUM: 'AMERICAN SPLENDOR: HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL MASTERWORKS FROM THE WADSWORTH ATHENEUM,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670. (Glueck)    * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 or whitney.org. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * SARAH SZE: 'CORNER PLOT' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    YES BRUCE NAUMAN There has never been much in the way of ''No'' to the influential Post-Minimalist and sculptor-of-all-trades Bruce Nauman. But this astutely structured, if male-dominated, exhibition considers his importance anew, especially his use of language, neon and the body, and his visceral sense of form. The show's title is taken from a 1989 work by Jessica Diamond that is included, along with pertinent efforts by Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, Glenn Ligon, Jason Rhoades, Peter Coffin, Diana Thater, John Bock and, of course, Mr. Nauman himself. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through Sept. 9. (The gallery will be closed Aug. 21 to 25.) (Smith)    Galleries: Chelsea     * A BROKEN ARM The title is a tribute to Duchamp. The works review various strategies of using found objects or images in photography, painting and sculpture. The seven artists include Gedi Sibony, Arnold Odermatt and Karen Kalimnik. All has been orchestrated by Mari Spirito, the gallery's director. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)    * DERECONSTRUCTION Matthew Higgs, director of the alternative space White Columns, has assembled a handsome show that in typical Higgs fashion brings together outsider, emerging, hip and formerly hip artists. Variations on collage and assemblage predominate without feeling stale. The larger point: deconstruction has had its day, and it is time to start putting things back together again. The putters range from A. R. Penck and Lucas Samaras to Carter and Alexandra Bircken. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9301, gladstonegallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)     * GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    * AMER KOBASLIJA: 'LARGE-SCALE STUDIO PAINTINGS' Large, exhaustively detailed, sensuously painted fish-eye views of the artist's studio. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Aug. 18. (Johnson)    'MATERIALITY' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, through Aug. 25. (Johnson)    'MEN' This show of 10 paintings of men by 10 women, organized by the painter Ellen Altfest, covers a lot of stylistic ground and includes an only partly tongue-in-cheek denunciation from the lesbian collective Redykeulous. Realism makes the strongest impression. I-20, 557 West 23rd Street, (212) 645-1100, I-20.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)    * HOWARDENA PINDELL: 'IN MY LIFETIME' Thirty years ago Howardena Pindell was well known for meditative, process-based abstract work, though her art has always had two aspects. In the 1970's and 80's it assumed and maintained an overtly political direction in large-scale pieces that combined abstraction, words and figures to deal with social and political issues, from AIDS and homelessness to the present war in Iraq. Both types are in this informal gallery retrospective, which makes clear how thoroughly they are based on -- and emerge from and are fueled and inflected by -- the individual experiences and memories of the artist herself. G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 316, (212) 929-6645, grnnamdi.com, through Aug. 31. (Cotter)    'WAR ON 45/MY MIRRORS ARE PAINTED BLACK (FOR YOU)' The latest word from the boys in black is a show of six artists organized by the head boy, Banks Violette. The stark glamour of it cannot be denied, but it looks too much like graphic design. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Sept. 2. (Smith)    Last Chance    JOE BIEL With an exacting illustrator's touch, Mr. Biel draws large, dreamily perverse images of children, like the one of a girl with rabbit ears and a whip peeking out of a cardboard box, and one of a knife-wielding boy crouching atop a pile of rubble and examining a bone he has found. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-0461, goffandrosenthal.com; closes today. (Johnson)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,'  This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States in a garrulous, very personal way. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 or brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)    * J. BENNETT FITTS: 'NO LIFEGUARD ON DUTY' Symbolically resonant photographs of mostly derelict motel swimming pools by a young Californian. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com; closes today. (Johnson)    * FOUNTAINS A summery theme is tweaked by energetic efforts. High points include Daniel Lefcourt's eye-popping photograph of studio tools, Sanford Biggers's video of a disco ball and Gibb Slife's television set, whose do-it-yourself antennae suggest spreading vines or brain waves. The low points seem to have been left out. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com; closes today. (Smith)    * 'A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL BEING WRITES POETRY ON A FIELD WITH SCULPTURES' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com; closes today. (Johnson)    'GIFTS GO IN ONE DIRECTION' With art selling so briskly these days, isn't it time for the art world to hand out some gift bags, some freebies? After all, artists, as members of an intensively networked and mutually supportive community, have been giving one another gifts. That is the subject of this charming summer show, which takes the form of a round-robin of generosity, with artists on both the giving and receiving ends. Apexart, 291 Church Street, near Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)    A RABBIT AS KING OF THE GHOSTS With a title lifted from Wallace Stevens, this elegant show posits photography as the leading ghost in the machine of contemporary art and draws visually telling analogies from 140 years of the medium's life span. It has been organized by the photographers Justine Kurland and Dan Torop. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com; closes today. (Smith)    TWO FRIENDS AND SO ON Selected by asking one artist to invite another, who asked another, until a group of 30 had accrued, this show winds from Conceptual-based work through abstract painting and sculpture, and back again, presenting a random cross-section of the art world and displaying a network of style-based alliances. It is a quite a ride. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com; closes tomorrow.

5,"His show was a beacon of popular culture,  with Robert Frost one day, Richard Pryor the next. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/11/arts/television/11cnd-douglas.html,"His show was a beacon of popular culture,  with Robert Frost one day, Richard Pryor the next. ","Mike Douglas, the genial television host whose afternoon talk show was a beacon of popular culture in the 1960's and 1970's, died Friday in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. His death came on his birthday, a generation after his irony-free broadcast style began to pass from the screen. He was believed to be 81. His wife of 62 years, Genevieve, confirmed his death to The Associated Press. Everyone from Richard Nixon to the Rolling Stones showed up on ""The Mike Douglas Show."" It had a run of more than two decades, beginning in 1961. At the height of its popularity, in the late 1960's, it was one of the most watched shows on television. About seven million people tuned in to the broadcast daily. They saw the pianists Liberace and Little Richard, Malcolm X and Barbra Streisand, the Catskills comedienne Totie Fields going goggled-eyed at the Kabuki-masked rocker Gene Simmons of Kiss. It was Robert Frost one day, Richard Pryor the next. The 1960's pop group called The Turtles was seated next to Truman Capote. And next to them sat Mr. Douglas, smiling and silver-tongued. The show provided a stage for Bill Cosby and Jay Leno when they were up-and-coming performers. It always featured musicians, reflecting Mr. Douglas's show-business beginnings as a singer, and they ranged from Frank Sinatra to John Lennon. Mr. Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono were Mr. Douglas's guest hosts for one week in 1972, when viewers were treated to Mr. Douglas singing the Beatles tune ""With a Little Help From My Friends,"" interviews with radical leaders like Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party and Jerry Rubin of the Youth International Party, and Mr. Lennon playing his antiwar hymn ""Imagine."" The program also produced a pivotal moment in American political history: thecreative mind behind the scenes at ""The Mike Douglas Show"" in the 1960's, the producer Roger Ailes, became a crucial media adviser to Mr. Nixon in his successful run for President in 1968 after meeting him on the show. He went on to play a similar campaign role for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and is now chief executive officer of Fox News Channel and chairman of Fox Television. Mr. Douglas was not an interrogator like his television contemporary Mike Wallace, nor was he possessed of the cool of his late-night counterpart Johnny Carson. David Letterman, whose life as a daytime host was starting when Mr. Douglas's was winding down, became a kind of antithesis of Mr. Douglas. He usually served his guests softball questions, exuding good vibrations. Yet his program could make news. He offered Ralph Nader his first chance to question the safety of American automobiles on national television, and he let political figures from the far ends of the spectrum as well as the middle have their say. His success was also a foreshadowing of the future: in an era before cable television, Mr. Douglas was not a creature of the networks. His show was a syndicated production of the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company and sold to about 200 local stations. It was the first syndicated television show to win an Emmy. Toward the end of his long run, Mr. Douglas was being paid $2 million a year, a salary probably exceeded on television at the time only by Mr. Carson's. At the height of his fame, Mr. Douglas said he was always thinking of how to make a housewife in Cedar Rapids happy. The secret of his success, he said, was simple: ""I'm a square."" Michael Delaney Dowd Jr. was born on Aug. 11, 1925 (some sources suggest earlier dates in the 1920's) in Chicago, the son of a railway freight agent and a homemaker. He performed as a teenaged crooner on a cruise ship that sailed the Great Lakes out of Chicago. He moved to California after World War II and sang and recorded with the band of Kay Kyser, later appearing on ""Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge,"" a televised musical quiz show. (His was the lead voice on hits like ""The Old Lamplighter'' and ""Old Buttermilk Sky.'' ) He returned to Chicago as host of ""Hi, Ladies,"" a radio show aimed at housewives, but his career foundered in the 1950's. He was singing in a piano bar when Westinghouse offered him his own television talk show in 1961. ""The Mike Douglas Show"" began in Cleveland on a single station in December 1961. Within two years it was seen in Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco and Pittsburgh. The show moved to Philadelphia in 1965, making it easier to attract guests from New York. Its fame increased. By 1967 it was the most popular show on daytime television, the 14 minutes of commercials on the 90-minute show produced about $10 million annually for its creators, and Mr. Douglas, his wife, and their three daughters were living on a 30-room Tudor mansion on Philadelphia's Main Line. His ratings eventually declined in the 1970's, and his long run ended in 1982. In retirement, Mr. Douglas wrote a memoir, ""I'll Be Right Back: Memories of TV's Greatest Talk Show,"" (Simon & Schuster, 1999) and played golf. He fell ill from dehydration on a golf course a few weeks ago, his wife said. She survives him, along with their daughters Michele, Christine, and Kelly Anne, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. ""Mike is the glue,"" his producer, Mr. Ailes, said in 1967, the year the show won its first of five Emmy awards. ""Without him the show would fall apart."" Another of his producers, Larry Rosen, called Mr. Douglas ""a piece of clay - you can do anything with him."" It was meant as a tribute to a man who displayed an adaptable affability five times a week for 21 years.

9,"Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.    Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'THE FANTASTICKS' In previews; opens on Aug. 16. If you were one of the people who missed the 17,162 performances of this show the last time around, good news: Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones's romantic musical, which closed in 2002, is back (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100.    'INDIAN BLOOD' In previews; opens on Thursday. Primary Stages presents A. R. Gurney's new comedy about a rebellious boy coming of age in the 1940's. Mark Lamos directs (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.    'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' In previews; opens on Aug. 17. This musical sendup of biographical shows features Martin Short and an ensemble telling the story of his life. Mr. Short's beloved old characters, like Ed Grimley and Jiminy Glick, make appearances (2:15). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    MIDTOWN INTERNATIONAL THEATER FESTIVAL Through Sunday. This seventh annual showcase can all too easily get lost in the shuffle, despite its large and diverse collection of shows. There should be more than 60 productions this season, at four locations on 36th Street. Schedules and information: (212) 868-4444.    'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Aug. 21. Meryl Streep plays the title character in Tony Kushner's translation of Brecht's seminal play about a world at war. Kevin Kline also stars, and George C. Wolfe directs (2:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park. Free. Ticket information: (212) 539-8750.    'SEVEN GUITARS' In previews; opens Aug. 24. Signature Theater presents its first August Wilson revival since the playwright's death last year. Ruben Santiago-Hudson, who starred in the 1996 Broadway production, directs (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.    Broadway    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALL THIS INTIMACY' In this not-very-deep comedy-drama by Rajiv Joseph, a 30-year-old poet impregnates not only his girlfriend, but also two other women, within two weeks. The women, once they meet, are surprisingly unimpressed with his notable virility (1:45). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422. (Neil Genzlinger)    'AMAJUBA: LIKE DOVES WE RISE' Tormenting memories dissolve into soaring music, and pain is salved by a collective embrace in this heartfelt, powerfully performed theater piece about life under apartheid. The recollections of the five cast members and authors are woven together with a cappella performances of spirituals from the apartheid years and vignettes performed by the full cast. The actors all but glow with a sense of mission, as if telling their stories has given them new purpose and power (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200 (1:10). (Anita Gates)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'SHOUT!' A mini-skirted, go-go booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the show room of a Carnival Cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A STONE CARVER' Despite the high cliché factor, William Mastrosimone's play about an Italian immigrant who is losing his house to a highway exit is timely and sporadically touching, in large part because of Dan Lauria's over-the-top performance as the title character and old-world patriarch who makes a mean barrel of wine and never talks when he can shout (1:40). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Andrea Stevens)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE & OTHER STORY BOOKS' This children's musical, made up of 10 sketches based on 8 books, is diverse, adorable and free. Also, the adults laugh (1:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 642-9033. (Gates)    'NEVER TELL' The computer-involved characters in James Christy's intriguing drama about trust, video art and a society-changing application can be irritating but they're never boring (1:50). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'CLOUD TECTONICS' A solid rendition of Jose Rivera's thin fable about time, centering on a hitchhiking woman who has been pregnant for two years. Luis Vega is particularly good as the man who gives her a ride and shelter for the night (1:30). Culture Project-45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    * 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930's, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott)    'BEEN RICH ALL MY LIFE' (No rating, 80 minutes) This admiring documentary portrait of the Silver Belles, an indefatigable troupe of veteran Harlem tap dancers between the ages of 84 and 96, is a valuable historical footnote and a useful how-to movie about making the most of old age. (Stephen Holden)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)    'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    * 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeois Parisian marriage, about 1912. (Dargis)    'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden)    * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    'I Like Killing Flies' (R, 79 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Matt Mahurin paints an engaging if glib portrait of Kenny Shopsin, of the legendary or notorious, depending on your experience, Greenwich Village eatery that bears his name. (Dargis)    'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)    'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)    'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Nathan Lee)    * Little Miss Sunshine (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)    * 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)    * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)    * 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband, and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    'PEACEFUL WARRIOR' (PG-13, 120 minutes) As ludicrous as the title promises, yet supremely unembarrassed, this New Age enlightenment parable has its heart in the right place, but a mind of corny mush. (Lee)    'The Photographer, His Wife, Her Lover' (Not rated, 79 minutes) Art, adultery, divorce, lawyers and pots of money. Paul Yule's documentary wades unproductively through the mess surrounding the estate of the Brooklyn-born photographer O. Winston Link, who died in 2001. (Holden)    'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)  * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    * Scoop (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)    'SHADOWBOXER' (R, 93 minutes) This garish thriller starring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as contract killers and lovers is an extravagance that leaves you with your mouth hanging open -- partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness. (Holden)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    '13 Tzameti'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)    * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. (Dargis)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    You, Me and Dupree' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)    Film Series    THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS (Through Sept. 25) Film Forum's eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) begins on Monday night. ''The General'' (1926), his version of the great Civil War locomotive chase, will be shown, along with three early-1920's shorts. Other films in the series include ''Sherlock Jr.'' (1924) and ''The Cameraman'' (1928). 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates)    FRANK BORZAGE, HOLLYWOOD ROMANTIC (Through Aug. 20) The 24-film retrospective of Borzage (1893-1962) continues at the Museum of the Moving Image with four films this weekend.

The four-movie August series begins on Tuesday with ''Barefoot in the Park'' (1967), in which Robert Redford and Jane Fonda play mismatched newlyweds in a minuscule downtown apartment.

Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)    RAISING HELL: SAM PECKINPAH (Through Aug. 29) BAMcinématek's monthlong tribute to Peckinpah (1925-84) continues. Monday night's feature is ''The Getaway'' (1972), in which Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw rob a bank, badly. Tuesday night's is ''The Ballad of Cable Hogue'' (1970), starring Jason Robards as an entrepreneurial prospector. BAM Rose Cinemas, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    SUMMER SWASHBUCKLERS (Through Aug. 24) Film Forum's 36-movie celebration of old-style action pictures begins this weekend with two double features. ''Captain Blood'' (1935), with Errol Flynn, and ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' (1935), with Leslie Howard, are on the bill for Friday and Saturday, to be shown with ''The Scarlet Pumpernickel'' (1950), starring the dashing Daffy Duck.

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * CELEBRATE BROOKLYN AFRICAN FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) One of the highlights of the Celebrate Brooklyn schedule each summer is its daylong African concert, any 10 minutes of which is well worth the $3 suggested donation. This year features Kekele, a supergroup of Congolese rumba elders gathered à la ''Buena Vista Social Club,'' and Lagbaja, a Nigerian bandleader who plays muscular Afro-funk and hides his face in a scarf to symbolize Africa's political anonymity. (His name means ''anybody'' in Yoruban.) Others on the bill include Razia, a singer born in Madagascar and raised in Gabon; the African Underground All-Stars, a pan-African hip-hop collective whose M.C.'s include Chosan, from Sierra Leone, and Dola, of Tanzania; and Martino Atangana, a Cameroonian guitarist who lives in New York. From 2 to 9 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org. Lagbaja also plays at 8 and 11 p.m. on Wednesday at S.O.B.'s., 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Ben Sisario)    MARSHALL CRENSHAW (Tuesday and Wednesday) Marshall Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all, the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. At 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500, rodeobar.com; no cover. (Jon Pareles)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133, dannysgrandseapalace.com; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Stephen Holden)    HAZEL DICKENS; BONNY BILLY AND CAPTAIN ANOMOANON (Tomorrow and Sunday) The daughter of a West Virginia coal miner, Hazel Dickens sings sharp and unadorned bluegrass songs about hardship and defiant proletarian pride. (''They'll never shoot that union out of me.'') Nineteen years ago she appeared in John Sayles's film ''Matewan'' alongside Will Oldham, who has since developed a postmodern Appalachian folk style. He performs as Bonny Billy (one of his many pseudonyms), along with his brother Ned, who appears as Captain Anomoanon. Tomorrow at 7 and 9:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 and 6:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; sold out tomorrow, $30 on Sunday. (Sisario)    DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND (Tuesday) The magnificent ensemble that revitalized New Orleans brass-band music. It swaggers through the city's whole musical heritage: parades, rumba, swing, be-bop and modern jazz, for starters. Solos can head for the far side of tonality, but the band never loses touch with gutbucket, danceable funk. At 8:15 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza at Lincoln Center, Columbus Avenue at 64th Street, (212) 875-5766, lincolncenter.org; free. (Pareles)    FORRÓ IN THE DARK (Wednesday) For more than three years now, this group has been leading one of New York's best and lowest-tech dance parties at the East Village bar Nublu. The groove is a humble and sexy two-beat dance from northeastern Brazil called forró, made with accordion, hand-held percussion and, since this is New York, whiffs of distorted electric guitar. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., 62 Avenue C, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, East Village, nublu.net; $10. (Sisario)    DIAMANDA GALÁS (Thursday) She is invariably dressed in black, her face in witchy streaks of makeup, but Diamanda Galás needs only her voice to terrify, seduce and beguile. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from darkened Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. In the first of four shows at the new Spiegeltent downtown, she offers ''Long Black Veil,'' a program of morbid music by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Ornette Coleman and others. At 6 p.m., Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Sisario)    * HOT CHIP (Tonight) With wobbly electronic rhythms that seem to be made of melting jelly, and a strong command of the drippy disco ballad, this English group plays a kind of wistful but still snarky dance music. Get too lost in the beats and you'll miss smart gags like the oh-so-art-rock countdown of nonsense words in descending numbers of letters (''S-E-X-I-N-G, C-A-S-I-O, P-O-K-E''). With Oppenheimer. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, seaportmusicfestival.com; free. (Sisario)    JPMORGAN CHASE LATINO CULTURAL FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) This two-week multidisciplinary and multinational series in Queens winds up this weekend. The gritty, deep-voiced Cuban singer Albita performs tonight. Tomorrow features Inti-Illimani, a veteran Chilean group that plays traditional Andean songs, as well as African and Spanish hybrids. On Sunday Peru Negro, a big troupe of dancers and singers, traverses three centuries of Afro-Peruvian music. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m., Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 760-0064, queenstheatre.org; $35 tonight and Sunday, $30 tomorrow; $5 off when bought in advance. (Sisario)    LATIN ALTERNATIVE MUSIC CONFERENCE (Tonight and tomorrow) This annual series of concerts and discussion panels began six years ago, when a few Latin pop stars stood atop the charts (Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez), a varied rock and electronic scene flourished underground, and ''rock en Español'' was a marketing buzzword.The situation now is much the same, with fewer buzzwords: Shakira is an international phenomenon, while most Latin rock artists remain largely unknown to English-speaking American audiences. This will be mulled extensively at the daytime panels, but the best proof of the scene's vitality is the music itself. This weekend offers two free shows: Tonight at Celebrate Brooklyn are the Venezuelan groove-rockers Los Amigos Invisibles; Los Bunkers, from Chile; and Belanova, an electro-pop group from Mexico. Tomorrow afternoon at Central Park SummerStage are Gustavo Cerati, the former leader of the Argentine rock heroes Soda Stereo; Calle 13, a Puerto Rican reggaetón group; and the Mexican Institute of Sound. Tonight at 7:30, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. Tomorrow at 3, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. Information: latinalternative.com. (Sisario)    LL COOL J (Monday) One of the first bigger-than-the-block personalities of rap, LL Cool J still follows the same few guidelines of self-representation that have served him throughout his long career: appear shirtless as often as possible for photographers, title all your albums either after yourself (''Todd Smith,'' his latest, refers to his given name, James Todd Smith) or some superlative that Muhammad Ali might have used (''Phenomenon,'' ''Greatest of All Time''), and perform in as sweatily vigorous a way as you can. At 7:30 p.m., Wingate Field, Winthrop Street, between Brooklyn and Kingston Avenues, East Flatbush, Brooklyn, (718) 469-1912, brooklynconcerts.com; free. (Sisario)    * MANU CHAO (Monday) This great globalist rocker makes a rare appearance. In the 1980's, Manu Chao, a musical omnivore born in France to Spanish parents, led the pioneering Latin rock band Mano Negra, which fused the angry political punk of the Clash with flamenco and Algerian rai. Since the late 90's, despite minimal output, he has been a celebrated and inspirational symbol of high-minded, do-it-yourself multiculturalism: he dabbles in reggae and dub, rap, salsa, calypso and rock, and recently produced the eclectic Malian duo Amadou and Mariam. He plays a benefit concert for Celebrate Brooklyn, with Plastilina Mosh as the opening act. At 7 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell (see above); sold out. (Sisario)    DAVE MATTHEWS BAND (Tomorrow and Sunday) His own private Bonnaroo: Dave Matthews has programmed two days of kindred spirits at Randalls Island, a minifestival with a much more manageable seven bands instead of seven dozen. Both days feature the Dave Matthews Band, the robotically virtuosic banjoing of Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, the three-cheers-for-marijuana ska of Slightly Stoopid, and the Grateful Dead-influenced Tea Leaf Green. Tomorrow also has the mighty Southern rockers Gov't Mule, and on Sunday David Gray, the British singer-songwriter whose ballads mingle acoustic guitar and gentle electronica, will perform. At noon, Randalls Island, near Icahn Stadium, 1 Randalls Island, randallsislandconcerts.com, (212) 307-7171; sold out tomorrow, $55 and $62.50 on Sunday. (Sisario)    THE MIGHTY SPARROW (Tuesday) With wry lyrics and supple melodies, the Mighty Sparrow, who was born Slinger Francisco, made the carnival music of Trinidad and Tobago a political force and a pop phenomenon with a string of competition-winning hit songs that stretches back to the mid-1950's in which he comments on everything from the Shah to the first black Miss Universe. At 7 p.m., Queensbridge Park, Queens, (212) 360-8290, cityparksfoundation.org; free. (Pareles)    NEWPORT FOLK FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) In a way, this veteran festival, home of ''We Shall Overcome'' singalongs and Bob Dylan's 1965 electric crossing, is one of the most creatively programmed in the country. To expand the idea of folk music -- or at least to fill up the weekend at a time when folk groups are in small supply -- Newport folds in jazz, soul, even greasy funk. Tonight's concert has more traditional fare, with Ronan Tynan and Cherish the Ladies, both from Ireland. On tomorrow's roster are David Gray, Rosanne Cash, Bettye LaVette, Sonny Landreth, Sonya Kitchell, Mary Gauthier and others; Sunday features the Indigo Girls, the veteran New Orleans funk group the Meters, Madeleine Peyroux, Keller Williams and Odetta. Absent: any representation of the vital, young and underground ''freak folk'' movement. Tonight at 8, at the International Tennis Hall of Fame; tomorrow and Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Fort Adams State Park, Newport, R.I., (401) 847-3700, newportfolk.com; $30 to $75 tonight; $59 tomorrow and Sunday. (Sisario)    ONE RING ZERO (Monday) This Brooklyn band has set words by authors like Jonathan Lethem, Margaret Atwood and Rick Moody to kitchen-sink songs with toy piano and theremin. The group offers a screening of ''As Smart as They Are,'' a documentary about its formation. At 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $20; $10 for members. (Sisario)    GRANT-LEE PHILLIPS (Thursday) Mr. Phillips harks back to the earnest ambitions and expansive melodies of Bob Dylan and John Lennon, singing with the conviction that rock can still be heroic. Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Pareles)    THE RED KRAYOLA (Tuesday) The first album of the Red Crayola (as it was originally spelled) appeared in 1967, and Mayo Thompson has held on to its skewed psychedelic perspective ever since; he also spent some years as a member of Pere Ubu. He's fond of dissolving song structures, crypto-Marxist messages and woozy sounds, and when he reconvened the Red Krayola (the spelling was changed to avoid trademark problems) in 1994, he found fans and collaborators among progressive- and post-rock musicians. With Coyote, featuring members of the bands Vaz and Man Man. At 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $12. (Pareles)    * CANDI STATON (Wednesday) She has been a disco queen, a raw-voiced soul belter and, for much of the last two decades, a gospel singer. But Ms. Staton's greatest success has been with record collectors, who have kept her strong legacy of secular R & B alive and may have persuaded her to return to it: she recently released ''His Hands'' (Honest Jon's/Astralwerks), a stirring album of broken-heart songs and rich Southern blues that is her first such recording in decades. This concert is billed as Ms. Staton's first in New York in more than 20 years. With Stephanie McKay. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $25. (Sisario)    WARPED TOUR (Tomorrow) Now 12 years old, this skateboards-punk-and-tattoos circus includes Thursday, From Autumn to Ashes, Against Me!, Helmet, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, the Sounds, Motion City Soundtrack, NOFX, Bouncing Souls, Damone, Saves the Day, Senses Fail and the Academy Is  , Every Time I Die and many, many more. Best band name: Gym Class Heroes. Worst: Gatsby's American Dream. At noon, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, warpedtour.com; $35. (Sisario)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    MONTY ALEXANDER JAZZ AND ROOTS ENSEMBLE (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Alexander's most recent album, ''Concrete Jungle'' (Telarc), pays tribute to his celebrated countryman Bob Marley. He travels similar territory here, featuring his piano and melodica playing in a buoyant ensemble with Wendel Ferraro on guitar and vocals, Hassan Shakur on bass and George Fludas on drums. Through Aug. 13. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Nate Chinen)    JEFF BALLARD AND MARK TURNER (Tonight) Mr. Ballard, a drummer, and Mr. Turner, a tenor saxophonist, constitute two-thirds of Fly, a brainy yet earthy group that seeks adventure in collective interplay. Without a bassist or any harmonic accompaniment, their rapport at this performance should be stark and inspired. At 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    SAM BARDFELD'S STUFF SMITH PROJECT (Thursday) Mr. Bardfeld is a violinist with a wide-ranging résumé who spent all of June on tour with Bruce Springsteen's ''Seeger Sessions'' band. Here he pays tribute to a swing-era hero of his instrument, with help from the pianist Anthony Coleman and the bassist Brad Jones. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    SAM BARSH (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Barsh is a keyboardist with a gift for groove, as he has demonstrated on recent albums by the bassist Avishai Cohen and the guitarist Jeff Parker. Performing on a new jazz series with a Hudson River view, he enlists Tim Collins on vibraphone, Ari Folman-Cohen on bass and Jaimeo Brown on drums. At 9 and 10:30, the River Room, Riverbank State Park, Riverside Drive at 145th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 491-1500, theriverroomofharlem.com; no cover. (Chinen)    BEDROCK (Tonight) The keyboardist Uri Caine, the bassist Tim Lefebvre and the drummer Zach Danziger make up this trio, which absorbs elements of fusion, funk and drum-and-bass into its own deliriously groovy style. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) This little big band, led by the irrepressible slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein, has a new album called ''MTO Volume 1'' (Sunnyside) that's full of signature touches, like effervescent swing arrangements and covers of hits by Prince and Stevie Wonder. At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $12. (Chinen)    DAVID BINNEY (Tuesday and Wednesday) This alto saxophonist pursues an avant-gardism that embraces harmony, melody and rhythm, along with amplification. He performs in two different settings next week, first with his group Balance (on Tuesday) and then with a more experimental crew (on Wednesday). Tuesday at 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. Wednesday at 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    * CARAMOOR JAZZ FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) Roughly 50 miles upstate, this festival offers some smartly simple programming in a tented open-air environment. First up is the Paris-based pianist Kirk Lightsey, in a tribute to the recently departed John Hicks; then a quartet led by the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt; then the pianist Steve Kuhn, presenting his Third Stream compositions for a 12-piece string ensemble. After a dinner break, the pianist McCoy Tyner leads the final group, conceived as a tribute to the legacy of Impulse Records; his all-star lineup includes David Liebman and Donald Harrison on saxophones, Nicholas Payton on trumpet and Steve Turre on trombone. Starts at 2:30 p.m., with hourly sets until a dinner break at 6:30; the final set begins at 8. Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252, caramoor.org; $45 and $55. (Chinen)    RON CARTER QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Carter is a deeply literate bassist and composer whose ensembles usually give off light but little heat. That's fitting, in a way, for this appearance in a luminous, glass-enclosed planetarium, a ''Starry Nights'' performance to be broadcast live on WBGO. At 7:30 p.m., Rose Center for Earth and Space, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 81st Street, (212) 313-7278, amnh.org. Suggested admission: $14; $10.50 for students; $8 for children. (Chinen)    PAQUITO D'RIVERA SEXTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. D'Rivera, a clarinetist, alto saxophonist and longtime Cuban exile, favors bright extroversion in his music, which usually incorporates Latin rhythms. His band includes the trumpeter Diego Urcola, the pianist Alon Yavnai, the bassist Oscar Stagnaro and the percussionists Mark Walker and Pernell Saturnino. Through Aug. 13. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    EHRAN ELISHA'S KINETIC MUSIC (Sunday) In the late 1990's, the percussionist Ehran Elisha recorded an album called ''Lowdown'' (CIMP) featuring a suitelike composition for a group that included Roy Campbell Jr. on trumpet, David Bindman on tenor saxophone, Sam Bardfeld on violin and Bill Lowe on tuba.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States in a garrulous, very personal way. One particularly intense work, based on the belief that Abubakari II, ruler of Mali, crossed the Atlantic nearly 200 years before Columbus to discover the Americas, links the past with the present and Africa with the beloved Columbus of Ms. Robinson's childhood.

(Grace Glueck)    Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606 or daheshmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)    * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 or frick.org. (Holland Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500 or guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * INternational Center of Photography: 'On Air,' through Aug. 27. The South Korean artist Atta Kim's best-known body of work is a series called ''The Museum Project'' (1995-2002), for which he photographed his human subjects -- families, nude couples, maimed war veterans -- locked inside plexiglass exhibition cases like specimens on display. The series eventually took a religious turn, with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures here, in his first major American solo show, continue this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 or icp.org. (Cotter)    * metropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early-19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Met: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 4 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Smith)    * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of a kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. Many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Cotter)    Museum of Biblical Art: 'The Word on the Street: the photographs of Larry Racioppo,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500 or mobia.org. (Ken Johnson)    * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Kimmelman)    NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer, , through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 or neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)    New York Botanical Garden: Chihuly at the New York Botanical Garden, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700 or nybg.org. (Johnson)    * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. A large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 or nyhistory.org. (Cotter)    New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 or nypl.org. (Smith)    P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 or ps1.org. (Johnson)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000 or rmanyc.org. (Cotter)    * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 or whitney.org. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    * A BROKEN ARM The title is a tribute to Duchamp. The works review various strategies of using found objects or images in photography, painting and sculpture. The seven artists include Gedi Sibony, Arnold Odermatt and Karen Kalimnik. All has been orchestrated by Mari Spirito, the gallery's director. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)    * DERECONSTRUCTION Matthew Higgs, director of the alternative space White Columns, has assembled a handsome show that in typical Higgs fashion brings together outsider, emerging, hip and formerly hip artists. Variations on collage and assemblage predominate without feeling stale. The larger point: deconstruction has had its day, and it is time to start putting things back together again. The putters range from A. R. Penck and Lucas Samaras to Carter and Alexandra Bircken. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9301, gladstonegallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)    * J. Bennett Fitts: 'No Lifeguard on Duty' Symbolically resonant photographs of mostly derelict motel swimming pools by a young Californian. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com, through Aug. 11. (Johnson)    * FOUNTAINS A summery theme is tweaked by energetic efforts. High points include Daniel Lefcourt's eye-popping photograph of studio tools, Sanford Bigger's video of a disco ball and Gibb Slife's television set, whose do-it-yourself antenna suggests spreading vines or brain waves. The low points seem to have been left out. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com, through Aug. 11. (Smith)    * 'A Four-Dimensional Being Writes Poetry on a Field with Sculptures' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com, through Aug. 11. (Johnson)    * GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES The well-known Cologne art gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. That may be the point. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)    Michael Heizer Sculptures in concrete representing prehistoric hand tools much enlarged so that they resemble Modernist sculptures by a follower of Brancusi. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 421-3292 or pacewildenstein.com, through Sept. 23. (Johnson)    'Materiality' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, through Aug. 25. (Johnson)    MEN This show of 10 paintings of men by 10 women, organized by the painter Ellen Altfest, covers a lot of stylistic ground and includes an only partly tongue-in-cheek denunciation from the lesbian collective Redykeulous. Realism makes the strongest impression. I-20, 557 West 23rd Street, (212) 645-1100, I-20.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)    * Howardena Pindell: 'In My Lifetime' Thirty years ago, Howardena Pindell was well known for meditative, process-based abstract work, though her art has always had two aspects. In the 1970's and 80's it assumed and maintained an overtly political direction in large-scale pieces that combined abstraction, words and figures to deal with social and political issues, from AIDS and homelessness to the present war in Iraq. Both types are in this informal gallery retrospective, which makes clear how thoroughly they are based on -- emerge from, are fueled and inflected by -- the individual experiences and memories of the artist herself. G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 316, (212) 929-6645, grnnamdi.com, through Aug. 31. (Cotter)    A RABBIT AS KING OF THE GHOSTS With a title lifted from Wallace Stevens, this elegant show posits photography as the leading ghost in the machine of contemporary art and draws visually telling analogies from 140 years of the medium's life span. It has been organized by the photographers Justine Kurland and Dan Torop. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through Aug. 11. (Smith)    TWO FRIENDS AND SO ON Selected by asking one artist to invite another, who asked another, until a group of 30 had accrued, this show winds from Conceptual-based work through abstract painting and sculpture, and back again, presenting a random cross-section of the art world and displaying a network of style-based alliances. It is a quite a ride. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com, through Aug. 12. (Smith)    'WAR ON 45/MY MIRRORS ARE PAINTED BLACK (FOR YOU)' The latest word from the boys in black is a show of six artists organized by the head boy, Banks Violette. The stark glamour of it cannot be denied, but it looks too much like graphic design. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Sept. 2. (Smith)    Other Galleries    'Gifts Go in One Direction' With art selling so briskly these days, isn't it time for the art world to hand out some gift bags, some freebies? After all, artists, as members of an intensively networked and mutually supportive community, have been giving one another gifts. That is the subject of this charming summer show, which takes the form of a round-robin of generosity, with artists on both the giving and receiving ends. Apexart, 291 Church Street, near Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)    Last Chance    * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Mr. Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050 or tibordenagy.com; closes today.
