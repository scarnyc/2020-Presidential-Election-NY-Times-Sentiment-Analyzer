In helping to found our organization, he transformed an idea as a spark, into what became the New York City Police Foundation, a light that shone for cities across the nation, improving safety for citizens and police officers alike. A true pioneer, Dick applied world-class business acumen to practical problems in ways that generated the results which could be emulated by the world.

He was Chairman of the Nominating Committee and a member of the Executive Committee, Compensation Committee, and Technology Campaign Steering Committee.

Mr. Gelb matched the federal goverment's funding for the Precinct Crime Mapping Computer System, supported the Bulletproof Vest Campaign, the Technology Campaign, and provided generous support for the operating budgets, graduates of the Police Academy and the Foundation's Annual Journal and Benefit. Despite all this, and most important, Dick Gelb's contributions to the Foundation greatly exceeded what can be expressed in a simple list. Dick will never be replaced; he can only be succeeded.
