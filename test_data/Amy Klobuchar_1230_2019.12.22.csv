5,The governor of Minnesota and officials from several other states have ordered all bridges to be inspected.,https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/blogs/02thelede-followin696.html,The governor of Minnesota and officials from several other states have ordered all bridges to be inspected.,"  Searching for the best sources on the Bridge collapse around the Web. The full story from The Times is here.  Collapse Videos, Not a Hit on YouTube | 4:31 p.m. Eastern A blogger at ZDNet examines a minor mystery for observers of how the Web is watching the grim news. Russell Shaw ""was expecting to see one video broadly leading"" the YouTube rankings. But ""more page views were garnered in posts about Oprah Winfrey, lonelygirl15, Faith Hill, and Whoopi Goldberg.""   A few theories are offered.  Infrastructure Stocks Rally | 4:22 p.m. Eastern Bloomberg News reports that investors are betting on a boom in the infrastructure industry after the bridge collapse. Someone is going to have to inspect and fix all of those ""structurally deficient"" bridges.   ""This unfortunate incident in Minnesota is raising awareness on some of the civil infrastructure stocks,"" Steven Fisher, an analyst at UBS securities, told the business news wire. ""It certainly raises awareness to the need for spending in our country on improving our highways and bridges and transit systems.""  The Long Term | 3:20 p.m. Eastern Officials estimated that the rebuilding of the bridge would take one to two years, and the federal investigation close to a year, The Associated Press said.  Bridge Inspection Nation | 2:02 p.m. Eastern An order from Minnesota's governor to inspect all bridges in the state may have been an expected move to restore confidence. Other states are following suit with their own reassurances.   From Pennsylvania and Maine to Washington, DC and Washington state, the message from the government is clear: the bridges here are safe.   They were anticipating fears reflected in a headline in Missouri's Springfield News-Leader: ""Missouri bridges 4th most deficient in federal study.""      Federal Aid Released | 1:50 p.m. Eastern Secretary of Transportation Mary E. Peters announced that $5 million will soon be sent to ""to make sure that last night’s damage and debris"" and ""give crews the support they need to begin restoring traffic flow, clearing debris, setting up detours, and making repairs.” The amount was based on the state's request, she added.  Observations From Commenters | 12:11 p.m. Eastern One of the excellent thoughts shared over at NYTimes.com's forum on the bridge collapse is from Louis Massano, who connects the Minneapolis event with one near Amsterdam, N.Y., in 1987.   ""It was triggered by the erosion of material called 'riprap' in U.S. engineering slang, surrounding the underwater footings of the Schoharie Creek bridge’s piers,"" he writes. More on ""riprap"":   Over time, erosion patterns change, and if the piers of such a bridge are not properly inspected (underwater inspection is required, of course) or maintained, those piers can become undermined as the riprap is washed away or other undermining damage is caused. (Erosion of riprap seems have been the main cause of the Schoharie collapse. )  Another comment signed ""MJ"" urges readers to ""compare the collapsed steel truss bridge with the reinforced concrete arches of the intact bridge in the background of some of the photographs."" (The ninth image in this slide show has a decent shot.)  His point: the concrete arches stand independently, but in a truss design, if one steel truss falls, they all do. ""This poor design based primarily on cost considerations has been required all over this country in countless projects for the past 50 years,"" he continues. For examples, check out the rest of his comment.  A Senator's Shock | 11:17 a.m. Eastern ""A bridge in America just should not fall down,"" Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, said at a news conference. Earlier, she said ""this is just a mile from my home, a bridge I use all the time.""  Bush's Reaction | 11:04 a.m. Eastern The Associated Press reports President Bush's first comments:   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush offered his condolences to victims of the highway bridge collapse in Minneapolis on Thursday and said the federal government would help ensure that the span is rebuilt as quickly as possible.  ""We in the federal government must respond, and respond robustly, to help the people there not only recover, but to make sure that lifeline of activity -- that bridge -- gets rebuilt as quickly as possible,"" Bush said in the Rose Garden following a Cabinet meeting.      Cause: Unknown | 10:46 a.m. Eastern Minnesota Public Radio's take: Collapse mystifies officials, experts. They highlight two state inspections that in the past two years that found no structural problems. Adding to the picture was a link to a Web page written by John Week, the author of a survey of ""The Bridges And Structures Of The Major Rivers Of Minneapolis And St. Paul."" He points out that the bridge is a ""non-redundant"" structure. ""That is, if any one member fails, the entire bridge can collapse,"" he writes. He concludes:   Today, bridge engineers design bridges so that any single piece of the bridge can fail without causing the entire bridge to collapse. It is tragic that the I-35W bridge was built a few years too early to benefit from that lesson.  Scores of 'Deficient' Bridges | 9:44 a.m. Eastern The Department of Transportation's 2005 judgment that the bridge was ""structurally deficient"" has emerged as one of the most prominent signs of a missed signal of an impending disaster. But there are many, many more bridges with that rating, according to a 2006 count by The Federal Highway Administration. Minnesota alone has 1,135 bridges on the list of ""Deficient Bridges,"" and other states have thousands more. Check your state against the ""SD"" column on this spreadsheet.  A fraction of those actually collapse. Reuters has put out a chronology of bridge collapses in the U.S. around the world.  The F.H.W.A. explained how it classifies bridges in need of an overhaul in its 2006 report ""Status of the Nation's Highways, Bridges, and Transit."" There are two categories, ""structurally deficient"" and ""functionally obsolete"":   Structural deficiencies are characterized by deteriorated conditions of significant bridge elements and reduced load-carrying capacity. Functional obsolescence is a function of the geometrics of the bridge not meeting current design standards.  ""Neither type of deficiency indicates that a bridge is unsafe,"" it adds. As a former N.T.S.B. chairman told the Star-Tribune:   ""A structurally deficient bridge might be one not adequate for the traffic it takes, but not necessarily dangerous,"" Burnett said. ""But a lot of structurally deficient bridges are dangerous.""   Interestingly, it says that ""rural bridges tend to have a higher percentage of structural deficiencies, while urban bridges have a higher incidence of functional obsolescence due to rising traffic volumes."" But Minnesota's bridge, an urban one, received the more rare classification.   A Lower Toll | 9:09 a.m. Eastern The official death toll was revised downward to four, according to the coroner's office. ""There's no question that the fatality number will go up,"" Gov. Tim Pawlenty said this morning.  More than 60 were injured.   Recovery Briefing | 8:24 a.m. Eastern Officials in charge of the recovery briefed reporters this morning, saying that some 20 to 30 people were believed to still be missing, based on the number of vehicles involved. Some reports put the known death toll at 9 so far, but officials are not yet able to confirm that figure.  Sheriff Richard Stanek said the scene was not safe enough to resume the recovery effort. The currents in the Mississippi are strong, and the steel is dangerously twisted throughout the area, making it difficult for teams of scuba divers to work. The crews are also using sonar equipment.  A fully staffed recovery effort would continue for at least three days, but the overall work of searching for remains of victims will not be done by then. ""This is going to take a long time,"" Tim Dolan, the Minneapolis chief of police, said at least three times. Sheriff Stanek added that the authorities would do ""whatever it takes"" to find every victim of the disaster.  No volunteer workers are needed for the recovery effort itself, the sheriff said, but ""if the public wants to help, give blood.""   The 'Bus Miracle' | 8:11 a.m. Eastern A bright yellow shape seen in early aerial photos of the collapsed bridge prompted fears that dozens of schoolchildren might have been badly hurt, or worse. The Associated Press reports that a school bus was indeed on a section of the bridge that fell nearly 65 feet and pancaked onto roads beneath, but the students on board, at least 50 of them, came through largely unscathed. The full story and a local television report are here. This image, part of a series posted to NYTimes.com, shows the bus leaning up against the right side of a part of the bridge that is buckling towards the water.   LOCAL REPORTS | 7:55 a.m. Eastern The sun rose in Minneapolis at 5:59 a.m. Central time, allowing the search to continue in the Mississippi River, where at least 50 vehicles are believed to have plunged in the collapse of a bridge during rush hour Wednesday evening. Officials are calling the search a recovery operation -- no more survivors are expected in the tangle of steel and concrete, and the death toll estimate stands at 9, according to Minnesota's Star-Tribune. That figure was expected to rise.  Overnight, residents flocked to the scene, to look for loved ones, and see the wreckage for themselves. ""The stuff we saw is going to be burned in our minds forever,"" one onlooker told The Star-Tribune in a sidebar article. The paper also has eyewitness accounts of the collapse and the efforts of rescuers.  The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to Minneapolis to begin an investigation. Jim Burnett, a former chairman of the agency, offered his initial thoughts to the Star-Tribune early this morning. A possible combination of causes comes to mind, he said: vibration and fatigue cracking.   Jim Burnett said they should look at whether vibration from the construction work and from a train that was passing under the bridge contributed to the collapse.  ""Vibration is one of things that cause cracking to propagate,"" he said. ""They will be looking at that.""  A 2005 federal study rating the bridge as ""structurally deficient"" is of particular interest, he said.   Another report from Minnesota's Department of Transportation does not include that rating.
